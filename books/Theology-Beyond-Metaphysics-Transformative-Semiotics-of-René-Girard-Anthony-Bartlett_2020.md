# Theology Beyond Metaphysics Transformative Semiotics Of René Girard Anthony Bartlett (2020)

> A theory of human origins that is one-half Charles Darwin and one-half Cain and Abel is bound to entail a lot of rethinking of traditional themes. René Girard’s thesis of original human violence and the Bible’s power to reveal it has been around for more than a generation, but its consequences for Christian theology are still only slowly being unpacked. Anthony Bartlett’s book makes a signal contribution, representing an astonishing leap forward in understanding what a biblical disclosure of founding violence means for Christian thought and life. If human language arose directly out of the primal experience of murder, then semiotics becomes a core area for theological examination. Tracing the discipline of semiotics through postmodern thinkers, then back through its birth in the Latin era, Bartlett shows how Girard’s thought is itself a semiotic emergence, beyond standard Christian metaphysics. Above all, Girardian theory of human signs demands we see the generative impact of violence in our language and thought, and then, conversely, that the Word of God, crucified without retaliation and risen in the same identity, brings a totally new sign and relation into history, offering a thoroughgoing transformation of human life and meaning. - [Theology Beyond Metaphysics Transformative Semiotics of René Girard Anthony Bartlett ](https://www.amazon.com/Theology-Beyond-Metaphysics-Transformative-Semiotics/dp/1725264188?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

### Foreword

**Metaphysics and Theology: Anthony Bartlett's Perspective**

**Background:**
- Metaphysics not inherently bad but associated with a limited understanding of God
- Girard's theory: human structures rooted in violent origins, covered up by mythology and social prohibitions
- Western metaphysics criticized for perpetuating the problem

**Girard's Theory:**
- Origin of religion and culture through cathartic violence
- Scapegoat victims revealed in Hebrew Scriptures and Gospel Passion narratives
- Bible offers different sacred, deconstructing mythology and redefining God

**Metaphysics:**
- Implicated in the larger mythical enterprise to know and inhabit the world meaningfully
- Western metaphysics criticized for perpetuating violence and its containment
- Postmodern trends sacrificing realism for relativism and perpetual cascade of meanings

**Bartlett's Perspective:**
- Adept interpreter of Scripture, influenced by Girardian hermeneutic
- Central conviction: human structures can be transformed, false sacred undone
- Premodern alternative to modern metaphysics: science of signs (semiotics)
- Shift in metaphysics allows for real engagement with objects and genuine access to them
- Favors an ontology-replaced-by-love, direct engagement with the real based on love

**Metaphysics and Theology Connection:**
- Eschatological perspective: all things being made new in light of an in-coming future
- Critique of Western theology's investment in protology as violent origins
- Interprets biblical protology as eschatologically oriented protest literature.


### Preface

**Girard's Influence on Semiotics and Biblical Interpretation**

**Background:**
- Girard's work stands apart from central concerns of René Girard
- He didn't delve into philosophical frameworks, but his thinking was philosophically aware
- Comparison to a hedgehog with one big insight

**Meeting with Girard (1993):**
- Provocative lecture on gospels and anti-Semitism
- Focused on mimesis, passionately explaining the concept
- No trace of anti-Semitism in his thought
- Understanding of Bible as workshop of anthropological revelation

**Reception to Girard:**
- Hesitance from audience to engage with him
- Perceived as an outsider or challenging figure
- Placed a cordon sanitaire around himself by focusing on core concept

**Girard's Core Concept:**
- Human beings are unstable constructs seeking resolution through violence
- Cruel logic at root of human culture and formation
- Swam against prevailing attitude against metanarratives

**Semiotics Connection:**
- Study of signs, their production, and function
- Girard had insights into origins of signs, how they work
- Bible is a matter of stories and signs, suitable for semiotics study

**Trust in Scripture:**
- Focused on the web of scripture rather than structured metaphysics
- Aim to demonstrate the threads in Girard's original weft

**Impact and Legacy:**
- Passed on, feted for significant impact on thought
- Tapestry created to give a rightful place in pattern of human meaning.


### Introduction

**The Human Sign: A Theological Perspective**

**Introduction:**
- London as a city with multiple interpretations
- Connection between language, human signs, and theology
- The sign is central to all symbolic systems, including language
- Semiotics: formal study of signs and their function
- Generative anthropology of René Girard
- Biblical tradition reveals core findings for anthropology

**The Sign's Origins:**
- Primal symbolizing effect of original murder (Girard)
- Inverted and transformed into a primordial gesture of love in the biblical tradition
- Human system of meaning revolutionized at its core
- Nonviolence as a revelation of truth, not just an ethical response or spiritual practice

**The Concept of Nonviolence:**
- Double negative: a refusal and a transcendent positive
- Jesus' death and resurrection as the marker of this revolution in meaning
- Differences from traditional understanding of salvation

**Salvation as Transformation:**
- Not a brute transaction replicating human cruelty
- A new way of being human, transforming human understanding itself
- Shift from "things" and "ideas" to signs and relations
- Relation (hupostasis) as the term allowing for new possibilities within present existence
- Embrace relation instead of being as the real, made possible by the sign of love.


#### Exploring semiotics and the transformative power of language in Christianity

**Theological Semiotics: Understanding Christian Existence as a Real Relation to Another Humanity**

**Background:**
- Journey exploring theological semiotics, focusing on the sign and its impact on human relation
- Christianity involves a paradigm shift from metaphysical truth to semiosis (making meaning through signs)
- Language sets us in motion for understanding this transformation

**Language:**
- Something we inherit effortlessly and necessarily as humans
- Meditation on language's mystery as an introduction to the study
- Prepares reader for more serious, disciplined work ahead

**Academic Context:**
- Transitional chapter providing academic awareness of postmodernism
- Bible introduced as a radically new source of non-metaphysical meaning
- Postmodern world asserting a "constructed" nature to truth

**Charles Taylor's Perspective:**
- Human meaning shaped by articulation (new verbal expression)
- Articulation alters the shape of what matters to us, changes us
- Narrative produces meanings in a privileged way

**Bible as Story of Stories:**
- Transhistorical narrative with potential for human transformation
- Convincing power comes from whole background and telling of the story
- Significant impact on contemporary world.


#### Semiotics, Girardian anthropology, metaphysics, generative semiotics, Girard and Derrida, John Deely, semio-ontology, transformation of meaning, signs in the Gospel of John

**René Girard's Perspective on Semiotics**
* Girardian semiotics: evolutionary and radical, leading to semiotic reversal and new beginning (Chapters 2-5)
	+ Placed in parallel with Derrida's ideas (nonreligious "messianic" responsibility for the arrival of the "other")
* Deconstruction vs. Semiotics: similarities in biblical tradition, tracing semiotic transformation back to roots of culture (Chapters 6-8)
	+ Placing Girard alongside intellectual giants like Aquinas, Vico, Descartes, Heidegger, preparing ground for final estimate of semiotic thought
* Nature of Being: discussing the relation between signs and meaning in place of metaphysical universe (Chapter 9)
* Semiotics as a Theological Discipline: world redeemed from violence by the sign-value of love.

**Girard's Thought on Metaphysics vs. Semiotics**
* Metaphysical world sets all in order but backed up by structures created through generative violence (Chapter 9)
* Semiotic relationship offers an alternative to violent relation: self-giving love (hupostasis) and invisibility of semiotic meaning (The phenomenology of Jean-Luc Marion)
* Heidegger's perspective on being and the logos: accepting primordial violence in being, divergence from Girard
	+ Identifying Christ logos as radically other than Greek logos.

**Gospel of John as a Semiotic Masterpiece (Chapter 9)**
* Selection of Gospel for discussion due to its focus on Jesus' use of signs and the inverse of eternal truths
* Canonical recognition around mid-second century: problematic language, favorite among gnostic writers.


#### Exploring the semiotics of John's Gospel: Self-giving and the simultaneity of meaning.

**The Semiotics of the Gospel (John's Gospel)**

**Key Concepts:**
- **Semiotic analysis of John's Gospel**
- **Relation and transformation of meaning**
- **Iconic function**
- **Figures: Beloved Disciple, "I am" declarations, Glory shared by Jesus and Father**
- **Comparison to Sinai Christ iconography**

**Semiotics in the Gospel:**
- Analysis focuses on John's Gospel as a peak of semiotic transformation
- Preparation through Hebrew Bible narrative essential for understanding Jesus' self-pouring-out

**Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang:**
- Aliens and their language (Heptapod A & B)
- Impact on human consciousness: past, present, future as simultaneous
- Postmodern perspective on written language changing human life

**Heptapod B:**
- Unconventional written language
- Simultaneous understanding of everything at once
- Effects on Louise's mind and perception

**Implications for Human Meaning:**
- Four dimensions: depth in time, sense of the sacred, mutuality, empathy, and life
- Reconstituting primitive grammar from a start point of absolute self-giving as an alternative to Heptapod B's story.

**Biblical Tradition and Semiotics:**
- New Testament writing as a real-world implementation of semiotic transformation through love instead of violence.


### Chapter 1: Eavesdropping

**Eavesdropping on Foreign Conversations**

**Understanding Words and Language:**
- Observing conversations in a foreign language creates intrigue
- Speakers appear in another world, creating their own reality through words
- Objectivist perspective: words refer to real things with one-to-one references
  - Words act as pointers to physical experiences
  - Travel guide or dictionary can help translate unfamiliar words

**The Mystery of Words:**
- Words create a virtual world for speakers, disconnected from the physical environment
- Objectivist perspective: words represent personal impressions in speakers' minds
  - Difficulty establishing equivalence between languages based on external measures
- Belief in common world among cultures, but trust is subjective and inherent within language itself.

**The Role of Words:**
- Language carries us into another speaker's world through words
- No need for external verification or testing, as trust is intrinsic to the system

**Lexicon and Translation:**
- Handy lexicon/dictionary allows identification of foreign words
- Trust that the translated word represents something in the speaker's mind
  - Objectivist perspective: compilers went through each item with direct object pointing
  - Difficulty establishing equivalence between cultures' personal impressions.


#### Language meanings and translations: internal systems and personal experiences.

**Language Dictionaries:**
- Do not provide footnotes or references for translations or paraphrases
- Compilers rely on bilingual brains to ensure accuracy
- Lack of context can lead to misunderstandings

**Learning a Foreign Language:**
- Not about finding precise equivalents
- Process of entering the matrix of the language itself
- Words carry their own meaning, creating a system for understanding

**My Experience in Italy:**
- Learned meanings of words through context and usage
- Picked up "impegno" (commitment) and "frantoio" (olive press) without explicit look-up
- Understood the words differently than their English counterparts due to roots and resonances
- Personal translation process merging meaning worlds.

**Challenges with Language:**
- Lack of context can result in misunderstandings
- Strict realists may argue that I already had the "concept"
- The roots and resonances of a word shape its meaning, making it distinct from its English counterpart.


#### The relationship between language, meaning, and sense impressions: words as prejudices and the role of accuracy in communication.

**Language and Meaning**

**Words as Self-Contained Signifiers**:
- Words operate on their own "mysterious power" for meaning, not just by definition
- People often use words in a "vague, conventional, free-floating way" rather than strictly defining them

**The Color Spanish Example**:
- Objectivist argues that words have a precise scientific meaning (e.g., color = 565-590 nm light)
- But sense impressions and words operate on different planes of human information
- Words "secret their own sense" and come with distinct packages of meanings

**The Limitations of Language**:
- Sense impressions can be deceiving, and human opinion differs from reason
- Words are not numbers, they secrete their own meaning
- The "local setting" of a word contains an almost infinite amount of information

**Conclusion**:
- Words operate on their own self-contained energy or effect, not just by definition
- Sense impressions and words operate on different planes of human information


#### Neuroscience explores the neural basis of language and meaning through neurons and communication pathways.

**Understanding Meaning through Symbolism and Neural Science**

**The Power of Words:**
- Words have more meaning than just their literal definition
- They evoke a "rich field of meaning" and are "heavy with symbolism"
- The term "symbol" refers to a visual image with multiple layers of meaning
- Symbols can be connected to specific experiences or emotions

**Symbol vs. Sign:**
- A "symbol" is often seen as having richer meaning than a "sign"
- Charles Sanders Peirce saw it the other way around: signs are more basic, symbols have more meaning

**The Neural Basis of Language and Thought:**
- Contemporary advances in computer science show that machines can engage in conversations with humans
- Discoveries from neural science reveal the brain as a "neural machine" capable of processing vast amounts of information
- The human brain has approximately 100 billion neurons, each with thousands of connections or synapses
- Neurons work together to enable language and thought

**The Significance of Human Brain Structure:**
- Humans possess a disproportionate number of neurons compared to other mammals
- This neural complexity supports advanced communication, symbolism, language, and thought processes

**Implications:**
- The flow of language can be understood as neural communication sequences
- Damage to the brain impacts our ability to speak, remember, reason, and be aware.


#### Neural connections and language: meaning through embodied associations and open-ended processes.

**The Neural Studio of Language:**
* Our meaning is embodied and largely dependent on neural discharges
* The word "yellow" triggers a network of associations
* Frequency of light responsible for color perception, but meaning is derived from words
* Brain's ability to selectively pursue certain pathways during thought process
* Language facilitates memory recall and logical reasoning
* Gap in understanding the parallel function of the brain that guides selection of neural pathways
* Core perspective: language is the human function second to none, allowing for "semiotic shifts" and openness to new meaning.

**Neural Studio:**
* Complex network of associations linked to words and experiences
* Flash up during use of language or thought process
* Bounded yet borderless in terms of potential meaning
* Precise yet imprecise due to its ability to shift and change over time
* Factual basis (frequency of light) enhances significance of the word "yellow"
* Brain's natural idling allows for spontaneous flashing up of neural networks (daydreaming)
* Selective pursuit of certain pathways with memory or logic
* Ability to run parallel functions and guide selection of lit-up studios
* Not a perfect process, susceptible to failures in recall and logic.

**Language as a Function:**
* Second to none in importance for humans
* Open-endedness allows for exploration and discovery of truth
* Control over neural pathways is never perfect
* Arguments involve intentional statements proposing meaningful truth
* Logical functions, like "the whole includes the part," facilitate understanding but leave room for misunderstanding or non-understanding.


#### Origin of Language: Biblical Perspectives and Plato's Critique

**Natural Polysemy and Conversation**
- Words have a **semi-independent existence** that constructs conversations through their **porosity** and ability to evoke meaning in many ways
- This allows humans to have common names and ideas, as the "neural studio" enables our brains to recognize universal concepts
- Without this neural networking, words would be like **proper names**, making it impossible to learn language

**Understanding Foreign Conversations**
- A listener who overhears a foreign conversation is on the outside of the language world
- However, due to the **neural pathways** that enable human conversation, the listener's brain is still looking for meaning in the words and gestures
- If the listener spends time in the native country, they will gradually begin to understand and speak the language by imitating and replicating what they hear

**Linguistic Shifts and Human Change**
- Language is constantly evolving, with new words and expressions reflecting cultural shifts (e.g., "digispeak" on texting devices)
- These linguistic changes can model and mediate subtle human changes, such as the "impermanence around and within relationships"

**The Origin of Language**
- The first three chapters of the Bible do not explain the origin of language, treating it as a distinctly given human feature
- Plato's Socrates criticizes writing, suggesting that it could lead to forgetfulness by relying on written words rather than memory


#### Exploring the origins of language and the sacred through violent human conflicts in the Bible.

**Socrates and Thamus on Language**
- Socrates agrees with Thamus: language is a necessary human starting point
- Socrates argues for philosophical recollection of eternal truths, but this contradicts the idea that writing is required to establish memory of these truths
- The Bible also embraces a written tradition, starting with Moses and the prophets

**Significance of Gaps in Biblical Accounts**
- Gaps in biblical accounts, such as the sacrifice of Abel and Cain, are significant for what they leave out
- These gaps suggest there is more to be revealed about the human condition

**The Role of Violence in Language Development**
- René Girard's theory: violent origins led to the development of language and cognitive transcendence
- The first "word" emerged from the intensity of a crisis, accompanied by a vocalization that captured the event

**Substitution and Displacement in Language**
- Language allows for one thing to stand for another, creating a systemic unity while also incorporating difference
- The primordial cry from the murdering crowd contains all the necessary elements for language: meaning, sacredness, and the difference between "evil" and "good"
- Lying is built into the fabric of language

**Importance of Meaning Over Facts**
- Human existence is up and running with the power to give and shape meaning through language
- The basic misrecognition does not matter because the meaning, or story, is more important than the facts.


#### Exploring language origins: Violence, love, and biblical scripture's impact on meaning

**Language Origins and Meaning**

**Girard's Thesis**:
- Language originates from shared meaning brought by the sacred
- Vocabulary development follows as factual languages demand
- Long process with many false starts and failures

**Biblical Scripture Connection**:
- Provides unique source of revelation on violent origins of human language
- Brings knowledge of self and potential re-creation of humanity

**Impact on Meaning**:
- Revelation of violent origins destabilizes meaning in the world
- Introduces new meaning: love as the engine for transformation

**Language as World Creation**:
- Words create our world, shaping its understanding and realization
- Bible's gospel elements re-create language and humanity

**Linguistic Argument**:
- Humanizing effect cannot be denied
- Outcome: nonviolence, welcome of the other

**Understanding the Bible within Postmodernism**:
- Situes hermeneutic in broad context of postmodernism
- Full schematic of theological semiotics unfolds through book

**Additional Concepts**:
- Dictionary as "disguised encyclopedia" with infinite accidents
- Sign vs. symbol: numbers can be significant or symbolic
- Peirce's icon: closest equivalent to symbolic concept
- Turing test suggestion
- Plato's Phaedrus 275 a (Jowett, 75 ) quote on possibility of lying as part of semiosis.


### Chapter 2: Biblical Upgrade

**Postmodernism and the Constructed Nature of Human Truth:**
* Postmodernism: constructed nature of human truth, implying violence in our truth claims
* Rejection of metaphysical grounding for truth
* Implied violence in erecting privileged categories (race, gender, etc.)
* Actual violence remains largely on the level of thought and attitude
* Attack on privileged certainties can be seen as a form of privilege
* "Progressives" may be characterized as an oppressive elite

**René Girard's Theory:**
* Reveals human relationships at the heart of religious practice
* Biblical revelation unveils anthropology, generative way humans structure themselves through violence
* Traditional yet modern in understanding Bible as a tool for grasping human culture and meaning
* Slow, painful reprogramming necessary for alternative principle to arise
* Transformation from endless "waterwheel" of victimhood to forgiveness and nonviolence.

**Biblical Semiotic Transformation:**
* Bible reveals hidden violent spring of human culture
* New background or horizon necessary to identify the source of meaning
* Love enters as solution to endless cycle of victimization
* Alternative principle arises slowly through books of Hebrew Bible and Christian Scriptures.


#### The Bible: A Long Conversation Transforming Human Meaning through Divine Intervention

**The Semiotic Interpretation of the Bible**

**The Extended Revelation of Meaning**:
- The sole compelling explanation for an extended rhythm of revelation is that a profoundly new principle of human meaning can only emerge step by step, as humans can appropriate it.
- The Bible signifies a series of writings (ta biblia in Greek), indicating the possibility of scripture as a conversation with multiple contributors over a long period.
- This continuous conversation aims to reach towards a new level of articulation and understanding, rather than repeating the same thing over and over.

**The Shift in Human Meaning**:
- The Bible builds on the fluidity of human meaning, shifting it from its original source into new possibilities of construction.
- This shift has become possible and visible only after centuries of effort.
- The old order of violent certainty seeks to reassert itself, but this is doomed as the old meaning is breaking down.

**The Word Made Flesh**:
- In John's Gospel, the "Word" communicates a divine and philosophical principle that becomes identified with the person of Jesus, a human individual in time.
- This shifts the understanding of the eternal beginning to be suddenly historical, with truth manifest in the spoken and inherited discourse of humans.
- The logos is incarnate for the sake of the flesh, rather than the reverse.

**The Semiotic Interpretation of the Bible**:
- The Word made flesh is a change in flesh itself, including the quality of information by which our "flesh" is held together as meaning.
- This change cannot be brought about simply by dropping an abstract idea on humanity from above. It requires interpretation by the person of Jesus as a new kind of human being.


#### Semiotics of Bible's transformative meaning change and human redemption journey

**Understanding Semiotics in Christianity: The Process of Meaning Change**

**Overview:**
- Jesus's revelatory conversation with Luke not explicitly recorded but can be reconstructed through twenty-first century perspective and scholarship.
- Christian theology has always done exegesis, reading New Testament by reverse engineering Old Testament.
- Urgent to understand general theoretic of semiotic change in overall Bible terms.

**Semiotic Change Preparation:**
- Standard human programming: violence as source of meaning, impossible to emerge into free space.
- Narrative preparation: Old Testament story of God's people and their struggle for new meaning.

**Rebirth of Human Meaning in Jesus:**
- Prophet from Galilee embraces transformative meaning of scriptures.
- Intimate relationship with Father/Mother who intended this change.

**Percolation of Meaning at a Semiotic Level:**
- Jesus represents semiotic revolution, taken up by culture implicitly.
- Brings issue of violence and its victims to light through his suffering instead of retaliation.

**Reading the Transformative Pathway Theologically:**
- Jesus's religious meaning formulated within established metaphysical frameworks but creating own conditions for communication.
- Nonviolent theology arises from transformative events in living human beings.

**Value of Semiotics in Christianity:**
- Progressive transformative value for anyone who encounters it.
- Theological value for those who embrace it in faith as God's way of bringing about divine purpose.
- Read text backwards semiotically from Christ and forwards from Abraham.

**Background of Thinkers:**
- Girard's anthropological odyssey presented most fully in Battling to the End.
- Overview of essential prior stages introduced in next chapter.


### Chapter 3: Murderous Semiosis

**Girard's Thought on Semiotics and Humanity's Evolution**

**Introduction:**
- Introduction to René Girard's ideas on semiotics
- Origins of thoughts in human desire and violence
- Importance of understanding Girardian semiotics as a foundation for this study

**Semiotics and Girard:**
- Focus on the science and study of signs
- Connection between Girard's work and biblical semiotics
- Evolutionary perspective on language development
- Language's semi-autonomy and ability to carry us along without explanation
- Importance of strong objective references in understanding human meaning

**Girard's Anthropology:**
- Three basic stages of his thought: mimesis, scapegoating, and biblical revelation
- Humanity's violent past and the need for peace
- Possibility of a peaceful civilization despite recent violence
- Importance of understanding Girardian anthropology as a semiotically organic link to the biblical narrative

**Violence and the Sacred:**
- Book where Girard delved into imitative desire, archaic culture, and scapegoating
- Introduction of the surrogate victim principle in human culture
- Gathering evidence from various disciplines for his argument: ethnography, sociology, literature, psychology, semiotics

**Influences on Girard's Thought:**
- Claude Lévi-Strauss and structuralism in ethnographic research
- Impact of linguistics, specifically structural linguistics, on Lévi-Strauss' thinking
- Ferdinand de Saussure as a progenitor of the modern science of language and signs
- Borrowing the method of regarding relationships between terms as primary from Saussure.


#### Saussure's influence on Levi-Strauss and Girard: Language, kinship, and violence as systems of symbols and relationships

**Saussure's Influence on Semiotics and Girard**
- **Saussure's perspective**: No repeatable, conscious thought without words; phonemes (basic sound units) have nonessential character. Words work within a string of links and differences held with other sounds/signs around them in a particular language tradition. Relationships between signs produce functional meaning, not discrete or ideal units of information.
- **Structuralism in anthropology**: Lévi-Strauss applied Saussurean principles to kinship structures, seeing external relationships between separate family groups as the basic anthropological structure rather than idealized "elementary families."
- **Symbolic systems**: Kinship emerged as a symbolic system where pairs of oppositions control other pairs in an endless series of correlations and inversions. Relational attitudes of actual persons are of no inherent interest; only the structural balance and abstract symmetry matter.
- **Girard's breakthrough**: Girard used Lévi-Strauss's structural insights to reach his own dramatic breakthrough, arguing that the incest taboo and its results come from intense need to prevent violence at the heart of the human unit: primary crises between brothers/fathers/uncles for access to an available female, terrifyingly murderous results, and resulting sacred boundaries created to prevent reoccurrence.
- **Arbitrary but True**: Instead of a philosopher or mathematician at the dawn of human systems of thought, there is the human community and its terrified devices to prevent further killing. Girard forces through the structuralist surface.


#### Analyzing human language's violent and rational origins through myth, ritual, and generative semiotics (Girard)

**Girard's Perspective on Human Meaning and Language Origins:**

**Structuralism**:
- Negative but indispensable stage in discovery of sacred (generative violence)
- Provides insight into violent, nonrational origins of human meaning and language

**Girard's Analysis**:
- Existence of structure alongside absence of metaphysical order leads to insight that human meaning has violent origins
- Claims an order brought by violence provides conditions for emergence of symbolic meaning and empirical observation, leading to paradoxical degree of rational truth
- Posits concrete origin of language in event of foundational violence
- Constantly tension between arbitrary meaning and objective scientific truth

**Symbolic Thought and Language**:
- Human language and meaning begin with arbitrary victim of original violence
- Both arbitrary meaning and actual truth arise from this system
- "Symbolic thought" is initially no different than Lévi-Strauss's conceptual forms that structure the world
- Emphasizes fundamental triad: myth, ritual, and prohibitions as bulwarks against violent origins

**Biblical Revelation**:
- Special language bringing fundamental human truth to understanding the victim
- Bible joins with human sciences to bring specific scientific knowledge in its own right: knowledge of the victim.


#### Girard's evolutionary account of human consciousness through collective victimhood and attention emergence.

**Girard's Semiotics: The Emergence of Meaning and Sign-Making**

**Introduction:**
- Girard's semiotics introduce binaries (not this/but that) but go beyond them
- Birth of meaning at a primal level, prior to signs or symbols
- Awareness is an astonishing moment, a quantum leap from Levi-Strauss' formal constructions

**The Victim Mechanism:**
- Mimetic polarization fixes on a single victim during violence
- Violence abates, creating favorable conditions for the emergence of new attention
- Victim becomes the focal point for the entire community
- Victim imbued with emotions and crystallizes in awareness

**The Awakening of Attention:**
- No assumption that mechanism works right away
- Rudimentary signifying effects result from controlling excessive mimesis
- Cumulative process leading to human culture

**Evolutionary Account of Meaning-Making:**
- Abruptness and pain, like a birth or catastrophe
- Neural event in the brain, laying down pathways for progressively accessed and strengthened communication among individuals

**The Role of Binary Signs:**
- Structural linguistics require at least two signs that signify one another
- Girard proposes a simpler model: the exception that stands out against a confused mass or still unsorted multiplicity
- Rejects binary scheme for singular event of qualitative eruption and growth of meaningful attention

**Understanding the Sacred Event:**
- Primal moment of religious awe, unitary and synthetic, not differential and analytic.


#### Origins of Meaning: Victim as Transcendental Signifier in Religion and Language (René Girard)

**Girard's Theory of Meaning and Semiotics:**
* Girard claims victim functions as "transcendental signifier"
* Victim bears all actual and potential meaning for the community
* Original murder produced conditions for new group attention, contemplative and holistic in nature
* Victim serves as original matrix for differentiated world (inside/outside, before/after)
* Recognizes binary function in construction of meaning through opposites
* Religion gives rise to human culture and all other fields of meaning
* First sign is repetition of proto-event, the "ur-symbol"
* Signifiers diversify out of event of the sacred, providing single source for multiplication of meaning.

**Girard's Thoughts on Language and Ritual:**
* Articulate language and exchange of words have basis in ritual
* Cries during crisis reproduced in ritual, forming ordered rhythm like dance steps
* Primary vocables have religious meaning (e.g., Zeus or Ea)
* Intense sibilant sounds suggest something evil, hated yet powerful.

**Girard's Contribution to Semiotics:**
* Offers scientific demonstration of how meaning comes about
* Recognizes the binary function in construction of meaning through opposites
* Hypothesizes a holistic source for human ability to create meaning (religion)
* Closes the circle of thought about origin of signification.

**Significance of the Sacred:**
* Single source for multiplication of meaning
* Signifiers diversify out of event of the sacred
* Provides power to break open meaning to something other.


#### The origin of language: a divine intervention or collective violence? (Girard's semiotics)

**Girard's Theory on Divine Names and Meaning**

**Akkadian God Ea:**
- Represented as a god of water
- Pure vowel sound may echo emotional release
- Simplified examples of divine names

**Mimetic Theory:**
- Assumes radical upheaval at origin of cultural order
- Allows for symbolic emergence
- First word or sign establishes generative center for further sounds and meanings

**Helen Keller's Story:**
- Deaf and blind since infancy
- Understood meaning through "w-a-t-e-r"
- Experience of the word awakened her soul, gave birth to new thoughts

**Girard's Semiotics:**
- Sacred represents an epistemic fiction of colossal proportions
- Protective shell of deceit around humans
- Sign system is non-referential, enclosed within a system of ultimately false significance

**Manipulating the World:**
- Science enables manipulation with reasonably accurate relation to it
- Does not provide ultimate meaning or truth
- Original divine event was a fiction that fixed meaning in place

**Demythologization of Human Culture:**
- Question about source of demythologization remains unanswered in Book I.


#### Semiotics and Christian Revelation: Girard's perspective on biblical texts as transformative signs.

**Girard's Perspective on Christian Revelation and Semiotics:**
* Girard attributes the ability to understand cultural mechanisms to the indirect influence of Judeao-Christian scriptures (1)
* No mention of God or truth, only "formidably constraining influence" of scriptures (1)
* Implied Christian signifier at work in the world, not a rational proof for its existence (2)
* Revelation comes from outside human culture and takes place painfully and slowly through stories and signs (5)
* Bible declared a regenerative semiotics, changes historical meaning (6)
* Transformative anthropology assumes the existence of a nonviolent divine (7)
* Importance lies in semiotic shift as a revolutionary semiotics (8)

**Girard's Background:**
* Christian faith acknowledged (1)
* Offered apologetics for belief based on exposing human violence conspiracy and revealing victim (2)
* Focuses on writing, scripts, gospels, and New Testament (3-5)
* First book: Deceit, Desire and the Novel (6)
* Identified mimetic desire in novels as a form of pure semiotics (7)
* Insights came from reading literature without direct reference to life-world (8)

**Additional Context:**
* Michel Serres' appreciation for Girard as "new Darwin of the Human Sciences" (2)
* Confusion between semiology and semiotics; semiology refers only to language (10)
* Lévi-Strauss' influence on structural anthropology (9)
* Saussure's Course in General Linguistics introduced the term "semiology" for language studies (10).


### Chapter 4: The Thread of Deconstruction

**Jacques Derrida and the Deconstruction of Language:**

**Background**
- Jacques Derrida: Francophone Algerian Jew who challenged Western philosophical tradition
- Known for poststructuralist ideas on language and meaning
- Participated in "The Structuralist Controversy" conference in 1966, where he introduced the concept of the "transcendental signifier"

**Derrida's Thoughts on Language**
- Western philosophical tradition lacks a fixed point of meaning or self-presence
- Language substitutes terms that masquerade as absolute meaning or truth
- Examples: essence, existence, substance, soul, subject, beginning (arche), end (telos)
- The "supplement" - something added on to supplement what's missing
- Signifiers carry the sense of some real truth they are substituting for
- Derrida uses metonyms as stand-ins for this function of language or texts

**Impact on Philosophy and Meaning**
- Language is no longer a secondary, neutral function but becomes the main protagonist
- Realization that everything is a sign conditions our understanding of concepts and texts
- Maintains openness to meaning by acknowledging the illusory qualities of metaphysical concepts

**Derrida's Use of Metaphysical Concepts**
- Avoids constructing his own metaphysics but uses them to challenge traditional ideas
- Examples: sign itself, essence, existence, substance, etc.

**Key Passage**
- Announcement of how "language [had] invaded the universal problematic" - the nature of language undermines standard philosophical beliefs.


#### Saussure's linguistic theory: Signs, differences, and the arbitrary nature of language

**The Discovery of the Structurality of Structure**
- Derrida declares that the discovery of the structurality of structure has brought a decisive rupture
- This destroys the presence of a center or the center of a presence in the text
- It became necessary to think about:
  - The law which governs the desire for a center in the constitution of structure
  - The process of signification which orders the displacements and substitutions for this law of central presence
- The substitute does not substitute itself for anything which has existed before, but rather creates an infinite system of differences

**The Invasion of Language into the Universal Problematic**
- The absence of the transcendental signified extends the domain and play of signification infinitely
- Everything becomes discourse - a system in which the central signified, the original or transcendental signified, is never absolutely present outside a system of differences

**The Influence of Ferdinand de Saussure**
- Saussure's **Course in General Linguistics** is foundational for postmodern linguistics, semiotics, and anthropology
- Saussure established language as the bearer of meaning without dependence on a pure priority of thought
- **Signs** are not simple names or labels given to things, but have an internal composition of **signifier** and **signified**
- The **signifier** is not simply the sound, but a "sound-image" - it carries some kind of echo or signal in our heads
- Meaning arises from differences between signs bound together in a chain
- **Value** (the overall meaning of the term) can be affected by modifications to neighboring terms, even without changes to the actual signifier
- Signs have an essentially arbitrary character - there is nothing intrinsically tied to the concept, and the same concept can be expressed by vastly different signifiers


#### Exploring the Essential Role of Differences in Language and Meaning with Derrida.

**Buffalo Sentence and Saussure's Influence on Derrida:**
* The "Buffalo sentence" is an example of how language functions through differences between words, even when those differences are not audible or visible in the sentence.
* Saussure's theory of language highlights that grammatical forms are another mode of difference and signification.
* In a garbled sentence like "The Buffalo sentence," meaning is created by the brain recognizing differences within and between words to read it without problem.
* Derrida's work focuses on language, building upon Saussure's theories in his books Writing and Difference, Speech and Phenomena, and Of Grammatology.
* Derrida criticizes the "phonological" or "logocentric" orientation of linguistics, arguing that writing is an essential part of meaning as it creates differences between signs.
* Saussure's concept of the signifier being "incorporeal" and constituted by differences rather than material substance reflects Derrida's ideas on language.
* The mental concept (signified) is a result of the signifier and difference that produces it, with all signifieds functioning as signifiers in language.


#### Exploring Derrida's concepts of trace and différance, subverting metaphysics through language's deferral and difference.

**Derrida's Deconstruction of Language and Meaning**

**Deconstruction**:
- Subverts and inverts the traditional order of concept/sign/writing
- Exposes the process by which meaning is established and shape is imposed on the world
- Demonstrates the apparent arbitrariness of the sign and leads to a "frenzied dogmatism" in some circles

**Différance**:
- Derrida's term for the written form of "difference"
- Combines the meanings of "to differ" and "to defer"
- Represents the absence of presence and the connection to a larger system that suggests a presence
- Produces meaning through the interplay of absence and suggestion

**Trace**:
- One of Derrida's terms for the absent presence that constitutes meaning
- Connects to the larger system of signs, creating an "economy of traces"

**Significance of Writing**:
- The a in différance cannot be heard, but it puckishly draws attention to the written form
- Subverts the supposed privilege of speech over writing
- Hints at a wider significance beyond just the linguistic union of "difference" and "deferral"

**Metaphysical Tradition**:
- Derrida's descriptive language suggests an underlying victim or origin of the stream of signifiers
- Demystifies the self-present concept, drawing close to the actual origin


#### Derrida's "Of Grammatology": Trace, Différance, and Language as Absence

**Derrida's Deconstruction: The Concept of Trace**

**Introduction:**
- Derrida's exploration of signification and its relationship to time through the concept of trace
- Influenced by Heidegger's philosophy on being
- Not a theory of language per se but an investigation into Western metaphysics

**The Concept of Trace:**
1. Meaning of being forgotten in Western metaphysics: "the trace of difference" (Heidegger)
2. Essential relatedness of all signification
3. Structured through time, named as trace
4. Relates to past and future, constitutes present by this relation
5. Not a presence but a simulacrum of presence that dislocates and displaces
6. No fixed meaning or fulfilled sign to come
7. Absence produces meaning
8. Invisible role in the join between signifier and signified
9. Past and future divide the present, approximations rather than full presence
10. Language is about an absence and the simulacrum of a presence

**Derrida's Technique:**
- Subverts philosophical nostrums using linguistic devices (différance and trace)
- Analytic direction against resistance from language
- Undermines Western tradition while addressing practical linguistic reality
11. Speech/writing as a string of never-ending words and sentences
12. Meaning consists of a track/trace leading us forward, absent presence
13. Signifier and signified join: the fold between past and future
14. Full presence of truth is never possible in all statements
15. Language creates reality but also masks its magic or unreal nature.


### Chapter 5: After Truth: Coming of the Other

**Girard vs. Derrida: Intellectual Cousins**

**Girard's Perspective:**
- Little patience for "Continental Theory" and its fashionable avatar, Derrida
- Considered a slow and steady intellectual compared to the darting swordfish of his contemporaries
- Collected evidence on the problem of truth deferral

**Girard vs. Derrida: Similarities:**
- Both explore the idea of truth being deferred (always already or traceable to an original murder)
- Agree that violence is a crucial part of creating the illusion of truth

**Derrida's Perspective:**
- Recognized for his function of undoing "violent hierarchy" in language and society
- Focuses on overturning established hierarchies, but does not discuss origins of violence

**The Pharmakon and the Pharmakos:**
- Both Derrida and Plato use the concept of the pharmakon (remedy/poison) and its link to the pharmakos (scapegoat) in ancient Athenian history
- Derrida suggests that Plato's writing, particularly the Phaedrus, treats writing as a poison because it lacks true memory and authenticity
- Socrates' death is seen as an example of the pharmakos being driven out of society to establish Plato's doctrine of innate soul memory

**Girard's Perspective on Derrida:**
- Acknowledges that a semiotic system functions through trace and deferral, but disagrees with Derrida about its original center
- Believes the violent center must exist for communication to take place and develop in complexity

**Implications:**
- Both Girard and Derrida explore the relationship between violence and truth deferral from different angles
- Understanding both synchronic (present relationships) and diachronic (origins of establishment) perspectives is crucial for a full understanding of semiotics.


#### Exploring the origins of metaphysics: Heraclitus, violence, and deconstruction's parallel paths

**Evolutionary Diachrony and Metaphysics:**
- Understanding historical emergence is essential to avoid mystification
- Initial period of communication by center leads to dissolution and emergence of institutions (natural metaphysics)
- Metaphysical concepts like arche, telos, ousia have concrete institutional roots

**Heraclitus and Logos:**
- Heraclitus, sixth century BCE philosopher, used the term "logos" meaning word or principle of rationality
- Fragments suggest logos is linked to war, strife, and necessity as universal principles
- Christian tradition has misunderstood the connection between transcendental signified and violence in Greek intellectual tradition

**Girard and Derrida:**
- Girard's anthropological perspective challenges metaphysical confusion about origin of logos
- Both thinkers offer deconstruction as a way forward for understanding human meaning, which is rooted in linguistic uncertainty (Derrida) but also holds potential for social consciousness and political commentary.


#### Derrida's specters of Marx: Haunting demands for justice and ethical responsibility.

**Derrida's "Specters of Marx"**

**Background:**
- Invited speaker at a conference on Marxism's collapse (1993)
- Based discussion on The Communist Manifesto's opening line
- Published as book under same title

**Key Points:**
1. **A specter is haunting Europe—the specter of communism**: Derrida explores the concept of justice and its demands through Marx and Shakespeare's Hamlet.
2. **Communist project**: Marxist ideology focused on working classes, historical struggle, and revolutionary violence.
3. **Haunting demand for justice**: A ghostly call for vengeance that can't be properly fulfilled but summons us to respond; not limited to calculable restitution or law.
4. **Disjointed relationship**: Human beings are out of sync with themselves when faced with another's claim to justice, requiring a response in the self that is like death (an-economic).
5. **The Gift of Death**: Derrida's earlier work on death as a gift and the absolute other, inspired by Abraham's sacrifice and Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling.
6. **Impossible responsibility**: Every "other" makes an incommensurable demand, relativizing all others while requiring absolute responsibility.
7. **Ethics of the other**: Responsibility lies in responding to the demands of the absolute other without relation to others or before a universal tribunal.


#### Exploring Derrida's perspective on ethics, Abraham, and the messianic through semiotic shifts in language and human meaning.

**The Ethical Ideal of Abraham's Singular Responsibility**

**Abraham's Secret Gift**:
- Absolutely singular responsibility: facing God but not others
- Creates the secret of the true gift: "death or grace?"
- Contrasts with Christian economy of grace

**The Sermon on the Mount and Giving**:
- Promises "reward" for giving in secret, without public recognition
- Presupposes a calculation that goes beyond calculability
- Integrates the renunciation of calculable remuneration

**Derrida's Question: Does the Supposed New Economy Really Escape the Economy of Exchange?**
- Possible to give back to Abraham without destroying the gift's integrity?
- Can we preserve the giving without recognition, without payment?
- Does Abraham in the abandonment of his secret meet the spirit of his giving coming back to him?

**Semiotic Understanding and Human Transformation**:
- Semiotic shifts bring possible new behaviors as the intimate repertoire of human meaning expands and deepens
- Ethics is a human journey, not a pure philosophy
- Historical reality of human behavioral change produced by real semiotic change
- The messianic theme in Derrida's work: overcoming the shadow of vengeance, the end of violence.


#### Derrida's struggle with messianic structures and their semiotics in philosophy

**Derrida's Approach to Messianic Concepts**

**Background:**
- Derrida explores messianic structures of human experience
- Struggle between absolute structure or specific revelations as sources
- Hesitates between two hypotheses: general structure or unveiled events

**General Structure vs. Specific Revelations**:
- General structure could be seen as abstract and philosophical
- Risks exorcising the urgency and humanity of messianic experiences
- Atheological heritage of messianic questionable

**Atheological Heritage and Biblical Traditions**:
- Biblical traditions crucial for understanding messianicity's force
- Difficulty in maintaining an atheological position without biblical semiotics
- Derrida acknowledges the "nondogmatic doublets" in his own thought

**Girard and Derrida's Commonalities**:
- Both influenced by similar thinkers and semiotic origins
- Girard: violence and language, framing for naming and meaning
- Derrida: metaphysics of presence, destabilizing force of the "other"
- Transformative semiotics in both thought

**Biblical Narrative's Impact on Discourse**:
- Bible as an instrument transforming discourse over time
- Evidence for the weight of this claim should not be dismissed.


### Chapter 6: The Long March of Signs

**The Long March of Signs: Semiotics Through the Ages**

**Augustine's Impact on Semiotics:**
- First systematic application of the term "sign" (semeion) to both natural phenomena and words
- Broadened concept to include linguistic signs
- Materiality of revealed Christian scripture and sacraments led him to establish commonality between natural signs and words

**Augustine's Influence on Semiotics:**
- Foundational figure in the science of signs (semiotics)
- Established a semiotic perspective through his interest in Christian scripture
- Recognized scripture as a system of transformative signs

**Deely's Work and Contribution to Semiotics:**
- Traces development of semiotics from earliest days to postmodern era
- Focuses on key figures: Charles Peirce, Umberto Eco, Saussure
- Explores the materiality of signs in constructing our world while connecting us to reality
- Advocates for a postmodern defense of realism through the lens of medieval conceptual scheme

**Deely's Historical Perspective:**
- Follows the "Silk Road" to semiotic discovery, highlighting curious byways and major deviations
- Identifies John Poinsot as a crucial waypoint at the end of Latin age
- Suggests that Western thought might have progressed differently if Poinsot was followed instead of Descartes and Locke.

**Deely's Significance for Understanding Semiotics:**
- Provides historical context to semiotic understanding
- Distinguishes semiotics as a philosophical theme with biblical pathways underlying cultural development.


#### Exploring the philosophical roots of God as existence in Western thought, with a focus on Thomas Aquinas and Islamic influence.

**The Latin Age and Semiotics:**
- **Deely's argument for semiotics as essential discipline for postmodernism**
- **Four Ages of Understanding**: Deely presents semiotics as crucial discipline, with biblical texts creating underlying springs
- **Thomas Aquinas and Metaphysics**: Thomistic thought makes "being" part of the overall biblical message; existence is fundamental category of reality in Aquinas' metaphysics.

**Aquinas' Concept of God:**
- God named as ipsum esse subsistens (self-subsistent existence, pure act)
- Debt to Persian Islamic philosopher Avicenna's Notions on being and God
- Existence is the most fundamental category of reality for Aquinas
- God possesses being in and of himself, source of existence for all other beings.

**Impact of Greek Metaphysics:**
- Thomistic thought framed by Aristotelian metaphysics, but with a focus on God as existence itself
- Avicenna's influence on Aquinas through the Book of Healing: being as being is primary subject of metaphysics.

**Continuity in Being:**
- God named from his being as being (esse)
- Reasoning back from created things to necessary existence of God: some continuity in identity of being, God to things and vice versa.
- Theology conditioned by the "analogy of being" and metaphysics.


#### Exploring God and being through metaphysics and scripture: Augustine, Aquinas, and Heidegger.

**Theology for Thomas Aquinas: The Role of Reason and Revelation**

**Theology as Human Reason in Service of Faith**:
- Theology uses human reason to understand the mysteries of faith, which all lead back to God
- Scripture and tradition are materials for theologians to use, but it is up to them to give these a rationalized form using logic and philosophical reasoning

**Combining Metaphysics and Scripture**:
- This unique combination of metaphysics and scripture creates a distinctive Christian medieval thought-world
- God as "ipsum esse subsistens" (pure being) is the same God who called Abraham, spoke from the burning bush, and was proclaimed in the gospels
- The concept of "being" as the name for God can seem to expand the human experience of "being" to an infinite level, creating a "bloated, uncanny, monstrous" representation
- The metaphysician may argue that this requires denying all possible defect or imperfection to arrive at true transcendence, which necessitates an exclusionary/sacrificial gesture

**The Semiotics of the Bible Text**:
- The first chapter of Genesis is a conscious rereading of violent origins, shifting the semiotics to a new semiotics of beginning where God creates by effortless generosity and without conflict
- This new semiotics sets the scene for the whole semi-ontological program of the Bible, affirming that the created space is not an enemy or source of enemies, but a suitable space for life

**Creatio ex Nihilo and Genesis 1**:
- Augustine saw Genesis 1 as Catholic doctrine, opposing dualist cosmogony and emphasizing creation out of nothing
- In the thirteenth century, there was debate about an eternal world versus creatio ex nihilo
- Aquinas asserted that "out of nothing" does not mean "nothing" as a kind of "something", indicating that this idea can be derived from the phrase
- This proximity to the concept of "being" as "nothing" brings us close to the transformative dynamic of biblical revelation, in contrast to Heidegger's philosophy of being without God.


#### Heidegger's ontology connects human existence to being through nothingness and violence.

**Heidegger's Philosophy and Ontology**
- **Heidegger's philosophy**: parallel to Girard's primary scene where "the god" is an aspect of human existence or "being" in crisis
- Name given to Heidegger's philosophy: **ontology**
- Name Heidegger applied to traditional thought of "being" subordinate to God (Thomist thought): **"onto-theology"**
- Distinctive parting of ways between medieval universe and Heidegger's early 20th century description
- **Deely's perspective**: Heidegger, along with Charles Sanders Peirce, represents the critical break with modern rationalist age, entering postmodern philosophical thought
- **Heidegger** reconnects human being directly and immediately with "being," without metaphysical or onto-theological detour
- **Creatio ex nihilo**: pointed toward existence and act of being, showed implicit scene of "nothing" (meaning debated in medieval times)
- Heidegger's "no-thing" plays a constitutive role for his thought of being, related to existential mood of dread
- **Nothing** is both a primordial element in human awareness and of being as such
- **Dasein**: human existence; "Nothing" acts as something in itself, it "nihilates," not just one occurrence among many
- **Heidegger's realism**: specific kind, connects with previous themes (Girard's anthropology, Thomistic thought)
- Possibility to decode Heidegger in terms of Girard and find anthropological phenomena marked by violent origins presented in ontological terms
- **Thomistic thought**: sets itself out not as philosophy but as science of theology with divine revelation as formal subject matter; uses philosophy to explain itself, leading to conceptual excess over language of revelation
- **Genesis 1 creation account**: astonishing lack of violence compared to mythologies; proleptic theological critique of violence in literary parallel to story of Joseph and his brothers
- **Creatio ex nihilo**: should be read much more radically as **creatio extra or sine violentia**: creation outside, without or otherwise than violence
- Heidegger's "no-thing" is real to actual violent existence, contrasting with Thomistic thought's divine and human nonviolence.


#### Exploring human existence: Being-as-first-known, violence, and theology

**Genesis 1 as a Radical New Beginning**
- Genesis 1 offers a **radical new beginning to being**, out of and away from violence
- A semiotic reading provides a **prophetic description of creation**, true to the deep original purpose of God
- Elides prehistoric death in the account for the sake of a transformative revelation of future creational peace and life

**Thomistic Thought vs. Biblical Semiotics**
- Thomistic thought includes the logical necessity of **God as first cause** of everything, reinforcing a hierarchical order of origin, authority, and violence
- Contrast: The "**God**" of Genesis plunges into the ongoing struggle of a semi-independent creation, providing a language and culture for human and cosmic transformation

**Redemptive Semiotics Argument and Metaphysics**
- Redemptive semiotic argument offers a brief moment of consolation but cannot constitute a case for human meaning as such
- Semiotics versus metaphysics: The writers of Genesis 1 employed **metaphysical concepts**, but the signifier "god" is part of the legacy of human culture, carrying a wide set of signifieds attached to it
- Importance of allowing an essential language of nonviolence to progressively change the signifier "god" and its metaphysical baggage

**Trans-Semiosis and Theology**
- Theology is a matter of **translation** rather than orthodoxy, focusing on the transformative nonviolence of Jesus, his Father/Mother, and the Spirit
- The gospel message is traditionally and continually capable of flooding our souls with a new sense of being, arising within the world and changing it from within


#### Exploring the connection between Heidegger's ontology and semiotics in human existence.

**Heidegger's Ontology and Its Impact on Philosophy**

**Introduction**:
- Heidegger introduced the concept of "Dasein" (being-in-the-world) as the place where being is revealed
- Being is directly disclosed in human existence, known as Dasein
- This structure challenges Cartesian dualism and provides a bridge between ontology and semiotics

**Heidegger's Understanding of Language**:
- Speech belongs to the primary reflection of being, not a secondary bridge between "thing" and concept
- This returns the sign to the direct experience of being

**The Primordial Setting (primum cognitum)**:
- The primum cognitum is the situation where being is directly known
- It provides an alternative to idealism and empiricism, offering open-endedness and possibility in human existence

**Being as Foundation of Both Known Things and Human Knowers**:
- Being serves as the condition without which there would be no anthroposemiotics (study of signs in human life)
- The description of being shares similarities with Girardian scene of human meaning, within philosophical parameters.

**Conclusion**:
- Heidegger's work offers a significant break with modern thought by integrating ontology and semiotics
- This convergence helps us understand the primordial setting for the emergence of language and symbol as the scene of "what is."


#### Exploring the origin of being and signs in human violence and sacrifice.

**The Concept of "Being" in Heidegger's Light**

**Concept of Being**:
- Refers to the dawn of the human world
- Emerges from the primitive crisis of undifferentiated fighting hominids (prehumans)
- Characterized by confusion, emptiness, and dread
- Connected to "otherness" as such

**The Dawn of the Human World**:
- Moves rapidly to violence and murder
- Cannot be separated from the primitive confusion, emptiness, and dread
- Heidegger's "dread" and connection to "no-thing" fit at this point

**Semiotics and Being**:
- Signs and language are the most immediate concrete product of the crisis and its resolution
- Signs constitute the most primitive formal realization of "being"
- The first significant event (original murder) contains the concentrating force that makes the environment a "sudden shocking 'other'"
- The founding murder that "informs" the hominid about their world is the matrix of the sign itself
- Everything stands forth in a psychotic separation from the biological norm, leading to a conscious "horror and its mythologized religious resolution"

**Signification and Metaphysics**:
- Signification is born simultaneously with being
- Signs are used reflexively to take the power of the event, entering the realm of metaphysics
- Both being and the sign refer to "otherness"
- The world itself is the "other," rendered present in a sign, yet strange, infinite, and congenitally open

**The Semioverse**:
- Meaning and signs move forward toward more signs to fill the ever-complete semioverse
- They also move backward to recover the abandoned origins in human storymaking
- Deferral is an essential part of meaning

**Onto-theology vs. Semiotics**:
- Onto-theology is a disastrous starting place for theology
- The true starting place for theology is in the semiotic universe, the semioverse
- An event with sufficient force can reverse the vector of human sign-making, creating a life-giving stream of giving and grace from the victim
- The victim becomes a proactive agency of forgiveness and love, transforming the essential character of "being" to be nonviolent relation and urgent with reconciliation and peace.


### Chapter 7: Mountain of the Modern

**Deely's Ascent of Modern Thought: Empiricism and Rationalism**

**Descartes**:
- Gave birth to "clear and distinct ideas" as source of truth
- Considered "God" as self-authenticating idea
- Deliberately forswore appeal to Aristotelian philosophy

**Galileo**:
- New vision of heavens discredited Aristotelian cosmology
- Direct observation and experiment provided basis for truth

**Descartes' Discourse on Method**:
- Encouraged use of clear and distinct ideas as final authority
- Rule: Accept only what is plainly known and avoid doubt

**Locke**:
- Contradicted Descartes, emphasized empirical sensation as foundation of knowledge

**Problem with Empiricism**:
- Sensation is only known through internal perceptions of the mind
- Difficulty in determining connection to external objects

**Hume's Objection**:
- No foundation in reasoning for believing in connection to the real world

**Kant's Critique of Pure Reason**:
- Supported scientific discoveries by introducing a priori "concepts"
- Distinguished between objective reality and unknowable "thing-in-itself"
- Perception and conception are necessary for understanding the world


#### Exploring the role of signs in human culture: Vico's semiotics and the overlooked connection to human society.

**Deely's Perspective on Semiotics: Giambattista Vico**

**The Way of Ideas and the Last Leg to the Rationalist Mountain**
- Deely explores semiotics, the thought of the sign as ontologically related to what is signified
- He introduces Giambattista Vico's perspective on this topic

**Vico's Quote and Its Significance**
- Vico's quote: "the world of civil society has certainly been made by men"
- Emphasizes the need to study the world of nations, not just nature
- Represents the self-reflection of the human subject in modern philosophy

**Vico vs. Descartes**
- Vico criticizes Descartes and pure philosophy of ideas
- Proposes a different generation of truth: something more mythic and opaque
- Focuses on human society and the signs that go with it

**Vico's Principle: Verum Esse Ipsum Factum (Truth is What is Made)**
- Vico's principle opposes Descartes' "cogito"
- Refers to the world of human culture and its multifarious expressions

**Vico's Three-Age Scheme and Semiotics**
- Distinguishes human stages by the type of signs used: concrete, metaphoric/metonymic, rational
- Suggests our signs change as we do or vice versa
- Emphasizes the role of imaginative universals and mythic qualities in shaping human knowledge

**Vico's Bible and Hebrews**
- Separates the Bible from other human cultures to avoid church attention
- Places it outside his general frame of human culture but also in a different category
- Avoids the altar of divination, which would fit with a nonsacrificial (nonviolent) understanding of life

**Vico's Impact on Semiotics and Human Knowledge**
- Offers a new science of signs, imaginative universals, and mythic qualities
- Contrasts with Cartesian rationalism by emphasizing the historical development of human knowledge and signs.


#### Exploring sign theory through Latin philosophy's understanding of relation and being

**The Signum Significans: Understanding Human Meaning through Semiotics**

**Background:**
- Discussion on understanding the origin of human meaning and its connection to reality through semiotics
- Girard's concept of ur-sign as foundational for all signs after it
- Epistemological question: status of other signs and their relation to the "real world"

**Deely's Perspective:**
- Thoroughgoing Latinist, believes Latin thought reached full development in semiotic discovery
- Fundamental character of sign is relation
- Human subjects establish semiotic relation to world with profound effects on perceived reality
- Latin thought: truth and being are convertible; reality mediated through signs
- Postmodernism: semiotics come to prominence, connecting us to the real world

**The Concept of Ontological Relation:**
- Proposed by 17th century Portuguese thinker John Poinsot as greatest clarification of signum in Latin tradition
- Not an easy concept, depends on distinction between material and purely conceptual relations
- Everything explained in terms of something besides itself
- Substance has to be explained through categories or "accidents"; one category is relation (relatio secundum esse)
  - Defined as a feature whose essential condition of existence is being toward another
  - Represents physical relations in a near-infinite mesh or lattice in two dimensions, with each node connected to four other points
  - Introduce third dimension by placing another version of the same lattice vertically at each point, making each node connected to vertical scheme.


#### Relationality and Ontological Signs: Understanding Connection in the Physical and Conceptual Worlds

**Relation as Ontological Phenomenon:**
- **Vertical mesh of relations**: set of signifying or semiotic relations across existence in the real world, repeating it but as signs
- Each vertical set of neighbors to a horizontal node is a sign or set of signs communicating and being communicated to everything around
- Relationality becomes a way of being, or being-as-relation
- Ontological relation: relation that does not define itself by a "what," but relation as such
- Signs in nature (tracks in the snow) and conceptual signs share the ontological feature of relation
- Sign is constituted as a sign by an invisible relation, not anything intrinsic to it

**Relation in Physical World:**
- Relation runs through all things and constitutes them
- Everything is a complex of multilevel relations where each level connects to another
- Relation can be discovered to be a relation in more than one sense, bringing other levels of reality into relation with the first level of relation

**Relation in Thought:**
- Sign is in ontological relation (relation as such) with the signified
- Sign has no existence in itself but only in what other things become

**Implications and Developments:**
- The idea of relation being a way of being, or being-as-relation, suggests that the character of the relation can change while still being a relation
- This thought will remain as we gain more traction in contemporary developments in semiotics
- Deely's concept of "physiosemiosis" - signs operative outside of the purview of cognitive or sensate beings, as a feature of the universe itself.

**Trinity Doctrine and Semiotics:**
- Aquinas's doctrine of the Trinity can be seen as a pattern of relation in all things
- The three Persons of the Trinity are able to subsist as purely relative beings due to the mode of being of relation.


### Chapter 8: Postmodernity: Semiotic Triumph

**Charles Sanders Peirce's Triadic Semiotics**

**Background:**
- Peirce considered one of the most original minds of later nineteenth century, greatest American thinker
- Focused on semiotics (study of signs and their meaning)
- Published work totals 12,000 pages; unpublished manuscripts total 100,000 pages
- Discoveries in mathematics, symbolic logic, statistics
- Self-taught philosopher with strong interest in medieval realism (Duns Scotus)

**Triadic Structure:**
- Sign/object/interpretant: sign (Peirce's term for Saussure's signifier), object, interpretant (signified)
- Sign not arbitrary but effectively connected to the object
- Interpretant is a dynamic function that swallows up the role of the sign in meaning creation

**Significance:**
- Peirce's work on semiotics is seen as the endpoint of Deely's "Silk Road" journey
- Triadic relationships are essential to language and meaning, suggesting an "other" element in the universe.

**Triadic Relationships:**
- Found in various thinkers throughout history (Joachim of Fiore, Vico, Hegel, Comte, James George Frazer)
- Influenced by Christian Holy Trinity and biblical language
- Suggests something triadic in overall structure of the universe for Peirce as a realist.

**Peirce's Quote:**
> "[T]he problem of how genuine triadic relationships first arose in the world is a better, because more definite, formulation of the problem of how life first came about; and no explanation has ever been offered except that of pure chance, which we must suspect to be no explanation, owing to the suspicion that pure chance may itself be a vital phenomenon. In that case, life in the physiological sense would be due to life in the metaphysical sense."


#### Peirce's semiotics: The universe as an infinite web of interconnected signs and their dynamic relations, truth as communal consensus in a constantly evolving reality.

**Peirce's Semiotics: The Dynamic Nature of Signs and Meaning**

**Background:**
- Peirce's semiotics: a dynamic and open-ended system where signs are related to objects through qualities, leading to an infinite series of interpretants that shape meaning.

**Signs as Relational Entities:**
1. **Sign**: anything related to an object through a quality, bringing another thing (interpretant) into relation with the same object.
2. Infinite regression in representation: one interpretant leads to another, forming a chain of signs.
3. The universe as a "semioverse": communication is inherent in the physical world and human experience.
4. Utterer and interpreter: parties involved in the creation and understanding of signs (not necessarily humans).

**Truth and Reality:**
1. Knowledge of things in themselves is relative but real.
2. Ontological relation: sign as a relationship maintaining contact with reality while allowing for representation.
3. The community's experience and values determine truth and reality.
4. Ultimate judge or arbiter: process or evolution through human interaction in a collective context.

**Quotes:**
- "A Sign is anything which is related to a Second thing, its Object, in respect to a Quality, in such a way as to bring a Third thing, its Interpretant, into relation to the same Object, and that in such a way as to bring a Fourth into relation to that Object in the same form, ad infinitum."
- "We have direct experience of things in themselves. Nothing can be more completely false than that we can experience only our own ideas."
- "The real... is that which, sooner or later, information and reasoning would finally result in, and which is therefore independent of the vagaries of me and you."


#### Semiotics, Peirce's categories, human evolution, and agapastic development through sympathetic connections

**Peirce's Categories and Human Evolution**

**Peirce's Categories**:
- Peirce proposed a new set of "categories" that reduces the classic philosophical scheme to three: firstness, secondness, thirdness
- **Firstness**: Precedes all synthesis and differentiation; it has no unity and no parts. It cannot be articulately thought about without losing its characteristic innocence.
- **Secondness**: The stage where the mind awakens from its dream and introduces actual individual things, structures, and relationships.
- **Thirdness**: The interpretant and sorting out of relations into a semiotic whole, which happens near simultaneously with firstness and secondness.
- Peirce's categories are not solely about what is objective or mind-dependent, but the mixture and interweave of both in human experience.

**Human Evolution**:
- Peirce posited two modes of evolution: by chance (tychasm) and by mechanical necessity (anacasm).
- He also proposed a third mode, "agapastic development" or evolutionary love, which is the adoption of mental tendencies by an immediate attraction to the idea itself.
- This third mode can affect a whole people or community, and be communicated to individuals in sympathetic connection, even if they cannot consciously apprehend it.


#### Exploring Peirce's philosophy on transformative effects of love and semiotics in human meaning.

**Peirce's Semiotics: The Transformative Power of Signs**

**The Three Ways a Sign Affects an Individual:**
- **Collective Affection**: Influences people by virtue of their sympathy with their neighbors, even if they do not consciously "get" the central idea.
  - Example: The broad Christian movement and its "virtual" realization in the world.
- **Conversion Experience**: Attracts an individual through a striking experience or development of thought, resulting in a dramatic change of understanding.
  - Example: The conversion of St. Paul (Paul on the road to Damascus).
- **Direct Connection with the Divine**: Exercises a mysterious attraction on the mind, even before comprehension.
  - Example: Prophetic inspiration and the figure of Christ himself.

**Semiotics as Transformative:**
- Signs work before reflective thought and penetrate even indifferent minds, bringing new ways of understanding reality.
- Semiotics reaches the level of describing how a process of semiosis brings humanity to a new way of being human: one of love.

**Peirce's Optimism and the Role of Violence:**
- Peirce underestimated the role of violence in generating human meaning, failing to see how revolutionary its transformation into love can be.
- The emergence of mind from its dream involves "brute secondness" or a certain violence.

**The Semiotics of Saussure vs. Peirce:**
- Deely draws a rigid distinction between the semiotics of Saussure and those of Peirce, calling the former "semiology."
- Saussure's focus on linguistics restricts his science of signs to spoken language, leading to nominalism.
- Peirce's semiotics affirm that all things are in some way also signs and belong to "ontological relation," which connects one thing with another.

**The Reality of Signs:**
- Signs can be false; even a real-life sign like a rabbit track may not lead to the actual rabbit.
- The problem arises when dealing with human signs made by words, as humans have always made things up.


#### Exploring the evolution and transformation of signs in human meaning and truth.

**The Relationship Between Fraudulent and Truth-Bearing Signs**

**Myths as Fraudulent Signs**:
- Myths are often fraudulent signs that are necessarily true in their own way
- Examples include the belief that the sun goes around the earth, which provided useful information about time, direction, and a stable cosmos

**Science vs. Signs**:
- The model of science has challenged previous signs by revealing their limitations in understanding reality
- Even scientific descriptions (e.g., DNA) are still subject to revision

**Signs in Human Meaning**:
- The stories we tell about ourselves are inherently filled with falsehoods, such as the Nazi swastika and tales of Aryan supremacy
- There can be no presumption of realism when the object of inquiry is the inquirer herself (the "turn to the subject")

**The Limits of Natural Signs**:
- Human coding of signs like yellow are broader and more flexible than natural signs
- Even though correct interpretation of signs is essential for survival, the stories we tell ourselves about who we are have no strictures of nature

**The Power of Texts**:
- Umberto Eco's work provides a technical understanding of signs and their potential for dynamic change
- His novel "The Name of the Rose" explores the power of texts and the vanity of seeking grand narratives, with a focus on bloodshed as the foundation of truth


#### Semiotics and Human Meaning: Signs, Codes, and Invention with focus on lies and truth.

**Semiotics and Sign-Functions**

**Key Innovations:**
- Shift from "sign" to "sign-function"
- Focus on overall semiotic activity
- Emphasis on elements of expression and content in correlation

**Codes and Sememes:**
- Codes: schemes of relevant meaning given by connected interpretants
- Sememe: full encyclopedia of semantic and syntactic elements, context, and circumstance determining meaning
- Code not the sememe but conventional rules for generating it

**Unlimited Semiosis:**
- Signification explained through self-authenticating language
- Continual shiftings between signs, never touching directly
- Cultural units accessible only through semiotic entities

**Lying and Truth:**
- Lying as proprium of semiosis
- Implies possibility of better language or story
- Semiotic proprium of truth as opposite

**Invention and Aesthetics:**
- Invention: new way of organizing material continuum for content mapping
- Moderate invention: percept mapped onto established medium
- Radical invention: artist creates percept on canvas surface
- Code violation in language: deliberate ambiguity, uncanny objects, repeated attention required.


#### Semiotics, Transformative Meaning, Peirce, Bible, Divine Intervention, Human Relationships, Language, Codes, Creativity, Taylor.

**Transformative Semiotics: Peirce, Eco, and Theology**

**Peirce's Insights on Transformative Semiotics:**
- Divine relation at stake in theological texts (1)
- God intends to save us through changing human codes (2)
- Nonviolent and miraculous transformation of meaning (3)
- Language has power to change the human world (4)

**Peirce's Ideas: Realism, Love, and Transformation**
- Peircian realism: relation between love as an answer to the question of the real (5)
- Humanity lives by every word from God (6)
- Metaphysical externalism vs. internal density of meaning and relation in human beings (7)
- Power to change human codes at most original level (8)
- No accident that God speaks the world into life without violence (9)
- Transformation through language and semiotics (10)

**Eco's Theory of Semiotics:**

- Feedback loop between secular texts and biblical understanding (12)
- Girardian reading releases new code-making by the Bible tradition (13)
- Theology deals with core human relationships (14)

**Peirce's Influence on Eco:**
- Transformative semiotics: a preferable basis for theology over metaphysics (15)
- Peirce's ideas in "realism," love, and transformation align with Eco's thoughts (16)

**Additional References:**
- Charles Taylor on linguistic constitution and new human possibilities (17)
- Taylor's impact through meeting paradigmatic figures or reading texts (18)
- Impact of texts on our world and its possibilities (19)
- The Bible as a transformative text in this context.


### Chapter 9: Ontology: What’s Really Going On?

**Semiotics and Ontology: Understanding Reality through Signs**

**The Nature of Things: Ultimate Questions and Semiotics**
- Metaphysicians suggest that basing thought on semiotics leads to infinite chains of signifiers without an anchor in reality
- Concern for the real and ultimate nature of things is a constant thread throughout Western thought
- Question: Does following the "chain of signifiers" lead us to systemic uncertainty or something transformative and real?

**The Ontological Relation: Connection between Signs and Reality**
- The concept of "ontological relation" indicates some connection in signs to the way things are in an ultimate sense
- However, "ontological relation" can change, suggesting that it is the relation itself which is real, not necessarily what it reveals about reality
- This raises the question: Can "ontological relations" support false and misleading versions of reality? Or do they allow us to choose our version of truth?

**Scientific Truth versus Narrative**
- Scientific thought provides a privileged criterion for realism, based on empirical evidence and observation
- However, human story goes beyond science, with a positive appetite for narrative that may or may not be rooted in reality
- Philosophy seeks to understand the ultimate nature of being and human existence within it

**Heidegger and Jean-Luc Marion: Ontology and Theology**
- Heidegger provided a contemporary account of the character of being and human existence, focusing on the ontological relation
- Jean-Luc Marion aimed to develop a reflection that escapes Heidegger's critique regarding theology


#### Exploring the difference between idols and icons in signs, love, and being through Heidegger, Marion, and Girard.

**Heidegger's Concept of Being: A Shift from Metaphysics**
* Heidegger's work offers a definitive shift in understanding of "being"
* Established the concept of "ontological difference" - being cannot be thought of as a being, but as a condition for all beings
* Ontology and theology intertwined: God as Supreme Being is still a being, creating a scheme that reduces ultimate reality to individual beings (onto-theology)
* Heidegger's work frames 20th century thought and continues to influence 21st century understanding of being
* The thought of "God" is affected by this understanding: God as love before being

**Marion's Insights on Being and Love**
* If "God is love," then God loves before being, only embodies himself to love more closely
* Distinction between idol and icon based on how they signal
	+ Idol depends on the gaze that it satisfies
	+ Gaze makes the idol by resting in its material presence
	+ Idol is a mirror reflecting back the energy of human gaze, entrapping vision
	+ Idol traps the gaze, preventing it from going beyond the material element
* Icon opens a relation with the invisible

**The Difference between Idol and Icon**
* Both are examples of signa (signs)
* The idol depends on the human gaze that it satisfies
* Gaze makes the idol as a ultimate function of the gazeable
* Idol dazzles the gaze, causing it to come to a halt
* Icon opens relation with the invisible

**Implications for Understanding Reality**
* Heidegger's work suggests metaphysical tradition may not adequately communicate Christian message
* Marion's concept of "love before being" proposes new mode of relation that escapes the priority of being.


#### Exploring relations between invisible and visible through Christian iconography and semiotics.

**The Icon: Relation and the Invisible**

**Marion's Understanding of Icons (161-165)**
- The icon attempts to make visible the invisible, allowing for an infinite reference to something beyond itself
- The icon summons the gaze to surpass itself by never fixating on a single visible, as it presents the visible in relation to the invisible
- Marion references Christian artistic tradition and Eastern church Conciliar definitions to explain that venerating an icon involves connecting with the hypostasis (selfhood) of Christ
- Hypostasis is a technical term from Chalcedon Council's definition, representing the unfathomable identity of Jesus and God
- The icon creates a profoundly human form of relation by opening up to an endless dialogue between the viewer and the subject in the image

**Relation vs. Idolatry (165-168)**
- The idol sends the human gaze back purely to itself, while the icon invites the human to an infinite relationship with the other
- From a Christian perspective, the final nature of the universe is relation rather than being or substance
- The sign emerges as a catalyst for semiotics because it emphasizes the importance of ontological relation

**Ontology and Hypostasis (168-172)**
- "Ontological relation" refers to the real connection between beings in the world, which is more fluid and alive than strict scientific laws
- Signs can change and impact relations, allowing for multiple interpretations of cause and effect
- The resolution of a crisis or finding a scapegoat (signs) does not determine the actual outcome or truth.


#### Exploring the nature of being and transcendence through the lenses of ontology, semiotics, and violence.

**Relation Between Ontological and Hypostatic Relations**
- **Ontological relation**: a stage towards understanding metaphysics, where the universe is seen as an unfathomable mix of ontology (being) and hypostasis (becoming)
- **Hypostasis**: the in-breaking of hupostasis (the radically new relation of hypostasis), prompting the discovery of the word (of scripture) as sign and progressively the human world as a tissue of relations
- Hupostasis enables thinking about everything from a semiotic and transformative viewpoint, leading to the possibility of dynamic sign-relations that impact actual conditions of existence

**Heidegger's Ontology and Dasein**
- Heidegger capitalized on Christian hupostasis to formulate his account of human existence (Dasein) in **Being and Time**
- In Being and Time, Dasein is the hero, not because it sets out to be any kind of humanism but because ontology would not happen without the role of the human
- Marion suggests Heidegger's later work focuses more on being as such rather than the analytic of Dasein and the fundamental essence of phenomenology
- Heidegger's ontology covertly has human existence aim at being, with the human gaze deciding its "God" within that frame

**Idolatry of Being**
- Marion suggests Heidegger's Sein (being) is idolatrous because it has human existence aim at being, making it the hero while Dasein (the human) is its slave
- The proposition "God is a being" appears as an idol because it only returns the aim that every possible "God" has to be decided by the human gaze
- Marion proposes one (God) who gazes on us with unfathomable love from outside any possible constitution by the human gaze

**Transcendence and Violence**
- The human gaze always decides in advance that all transcendence ("every possible 'god'") has to be because it belongs essentially to original violence, a founding construction of the world out of anger and blood
- A "God without being" breaking into this hell of existence would not be violent but rather a "God without violence," foreign to our false coalescences of being
- Such a God works by hypostasis (unfathomable giving) that flows down, always able to pour out more and leave the sense of something incommensurable truth to be signed/signified.


#### Heidegger, Girard, and the radical departure from metaphysical understanding of God in Western thought

**Heidegger's Critique of Onto-Theology and Theological Metaphysics**

**Understanding God from a Girardian Perspective**
- Heidegger's critique reinforced by Girardian reading
- "God" belongs to something human beings do rather than a God from the outside
- Metaphysical tradition is a dishonest understanding of where concepts come from
- Conceptual idolatry infiltrates Christian tradition, making it difficult to grasp true God

**Epochal Shift from Metaphysics to Semiotics of Nonviolent Transcendence**
- Deconstruction, community, song, gift of tongues, art, movies, silence, centering prayer, contemplation, conversation, storytelling, signs, sacraments, scripture, personal discovery used to experience true God
- Theologian's role is to use conceptual language to find freedom from it and point to irruptive relation with God

**Girard's Insights on Logos and Violence**
- Recognizes Heidegger's distinction between Greek and Christian Logos
- Affirms critique of onto-theology, focusing on nonviolence in the Gospel
- Christianity has never been separate from Greek thought; continuity exists but authentic Logos has been expelled by sacrificial reading and ecclesiastical tradition.


#### Exploring the transformative power of nonviolent Logos in philosophy and religion.

**Girard's Analysis of the Reformation and the Logos:**
* Protestant readers should not equate the Reformation with primitive biblical Logos (180)
* Reformation was a violent movement, not nonviolent (181)
* Expulsion of the Logos marks its genuineness in a violent system (181)
* Girard's argument has contradictions: how can he detect expelled Logos if it hasn't opened its space of revelation? (182)
* Marion's "iconic vision" offers an alternative perspective on the self-giving Logos as fathomless depths that pour themselves out and invite us into the same (183)
* The sign of the Logos/Word enters the world, challenging violent ontology (184)

**The Role of Violence in Ontology:**
* Philosophical Logos: organizing principle of beings (traditional term) (185)
* Heraclitean logos as principle of power (ontologically and concretely) (186)
* Christian tradition emphasizes Logos as discourse, narrative or word (radicalization) (187)
* Significance of nonviolent self-giving in a universe of violent things (impossibility) (188)
* Choosing to remain in violent ontology does not stop the meaning or relation of transformed universe asserting itself.

**Myth vs. Reality:**
* Ideology can be constructed to maintain oppressive order, but individuals may choose to serve and not retaliate (nonviolent self-giving) (190)
* The Word exists while all else seems like violence (200)
* Progressively, this Word stands forth as the most real thing there is (201)
* Being itself will disappear if it destroys human beings; hupostasis relation is the only thing that can save being.


### Chapter 10: The Semiotic Gospel

**The Semiotic Gospel of John: Transformative Semiosis**

**Background**
- The Gospel of John stands out for its exceptional use of signs and symbols in the New Testament
- Its operation of signs is considered the peak example in the entire biblical corpus
- Provides a unique authority and voice through the Beloved Disciple figure

**The Beloved Disciple**
- A powerful reference without clear identity, making it a "sign" or interpretant
- Appears only in the final stages of the Gospel
- Traditionally identified as John, son of Zebedee, but modern scholarship disagrees
- Likely a historical figure not among the Twelve, or a textual device
- The anonymity is deliberate and carefully executed literary strategy

**Identity and Representation**
- The community centered on this figure must have a core individual at its heart
- Beloved Disciple may be a representative figure comprising many individuals
- Women's leadership could provide a connection to the situation, invoking their suspect status within overall male apostolic Christianity

**Johannine Community Evolution**
- Scholarship suggests the Johannine community evolved through stages (Brown's hypothesis)
- Secessionists emphasized divinity of Christ, negating earthly reality of Jesus
- Those gathered around Beloved Disciple sought refuge in Petrine Christianity to preserve incarnational materialism alongside exalted divine notion.

**Mary Magdalene's Role as Beloved Disciple in Johannine Gospel**

**Background:**
- Irenaeus (c. 130 – 200) defended the authorship of Johannine Gospel and epistles, leading to uncertainty about its canonical place in early church
- Gnostics were labeled heretics due to their prominent roles and functions for women, including Mary Magdalene as the most important female leadership figure

**Mary Magdalene's Parallels with Beloved Disciple:**
- Favorite and beloved disciple of Jesus who understands his deep meaning (Gnostic literature)
- Transmits and explains Jesus' revelation, making her a rival for Simon Peter
- Jesus defends her preeminence among disciples
- Possible connection to Johannine Beloved Disciple

**Implications:**
- Female leadership in Christianity challenged by early church
- Mary Magdalene's role could have predated Gnostic interpretations
- Significance for semiotic reading of scriptures:
  * Neutralize possible personal rivalry between Mary and Simon Peter
  * Highlight real tension related to female interpretation

**Mary Magdalene as Textual Paradigm:**
- Beloved Disciple not a pure literary symbol or historical individual
- Represents corporate authority of Johannine school
- Embodies diverse ways of discipleship in Fourth Gospel

**Significance of "Beloved Disciple":**
- Premier biblical sign of John’s Gospel
- Inserts role and reality of Beloved Disciple into gospel discourse
- Symbolizes ongoing core language of Christianity

**Understanding the Text:**
- Overall shape: mandala with concentric rings, focusing on Jesus' miracles and new event for a new Israel
- Repetition of words creating circular motifs, offering depth and panorama in meaning.


#### Exploring the semiotic significance of John's Gospel: Light as divine person and transformative sign.

**Gospel of John's Theological Significance**
* Traditionally known as "the theologian" due to deliberate use of the word 'logos'
* Gospel employs signs and symbols beyond straightforward narrative progression
* Jesus is declared "light of the world" in chapter 8:12, creating a universal human symbol for life
* The connection between Jesus as light and the prologue's description of him as "light of all people" creates a powerful tension around his person
* Healings performed by Jesus are considered signs from God, mediating the depth of what this person means
* Miracles have sign value but are not to be fastened on in an external way; they lead us to something dramatically different and new.

**Significance of the Man Born Blind**
* His healing is extraordinary due to his being born blind
* The reason for his blindness was proleptic, revealed in future things
* Healing is part of God's work to release creation from bondage to violence
* The man's understanding or sight progresses throughout the story, culminating in his climactic statement that Jesus must be from God.

**Symbolism in Gospel of John**
* Miracles are considered signs from God, carrying sign value but not to be fastened on in an external way
* Healing of the man born blind is a major category for understanding the gospel
* The elaborate theater or symbolic actions and stage directions surrounding Jesus contribute to the text's meaning.


#### Exploring the semiotics of John's Gospel: Irony, divine relation, and sign functions.

**Symbolism in John's Gospel:**
* Schneiders asserts that Johannine semeia are symbols, not signs (202)
* Symbols participate in what they represent and render the transcendent present (vs. signs pointing to an otherworldly reality)
* Criticism: assumption of a soul's ability to access transcendence through symbolism without critical examination
* Girardian perspective: symbolism belongs to primitive sacred, subject to critique via reflective system of signs (semiotics)

**The Man Born Blind:**
* Jesus uses mud and spittle for healing, referencing Old Testament creation story (Gen 2:7, Exodus 3:14-15)
* Text draws reader into meaning-making process through multiple sign functions
* The phrase "I am the light of the world" echoes divine name in Exodus and multiplied personal pronouns in Isaiah 43:25
* Use of irony throughout John's Gospel serves a semiotic purpose, not just a literary device.


#### Exploring John's Gospel: Paradox, Slippage, and Semiotics in the Crucifixion's Transformative Power

**John's Gospel: Paradoxes and Semiotics**

**Understanding John's Gospel**
- Consistently offers alternative set of interpretants for reader
- Encourages "seeing" things differently
- Creates a sense of instability or openness in meaning
- Collapses one world into another

**The Passion Narrative: Paradoxical Elements**
- Jesus subjected to brutal crucifixion with no defense or resistance
- Seemingly in control during the process
- Readers may interpret as Gnosticism or divine identity

**Gospel's Semiotics and Slippage**
- Brutal violence of crucifixion transformed into forgiveness and peace
- Semiosis of crucifixion becomes its absolute reversal: nonviolence, love, new meaning
- A semiotic event constructing a new fundamental relation to truth

**Crucial Passage: John 12:27-33**
- Jesus troubled but accepts Father's will for his death
- Voice from heaven glorifies the Father and Son
- Crowd misunderstands the situation as thunder or angelic voice
- Jesus clarifies that this event is for humanity's sake, not his own
- Judgment upon world's ruler and drawing all people to himself.

**The Theme of Glory in John's Gospel**
- Natural association with heavenly vistas, triumphant parades, blinding theophanies
- Tied to the hour of suffering, imminent death
- Father's truth and presence also tied to the event of Jesus’s death
- Transformation carried through by the Gospel: Glory of Son of Man equals glory of Father's name.


#### Exploring the semiotics of glory and transformation in John's Gospel.

**John's Gospel: Glorification of God's Name**

**Glorification of God's Name as Key Motif**
- Refers to manifestation of Father's identity in the earth
- Evangelist's term for violence turning into grace through cross
- Reveals God fully historically (absolute beginning)

**Prologue: The Word Became Flesh**
- Jesus's glory: Father's selfhood made public by cross
- Eternal presence before time or preemptive relation
- Absolute beginning in semiotic sense and historical objective sense

**Glorification of Son (Last Supper Discourse)**
- Prayer for Father to glorify Son to manifest His identity
- Jesus's glory: selfhood of Father brought close
- Before the world existed: absolute relation or foundation of world

**Use of "Beginning" in Absolute Sense**
- In prologue, at 1 : 14 and throughout Gospel
- Refers to semiotic sense (new beginning of meaning)
- Preempts negative beginning (diabolos, adversary)

**Semiosis of Text: Transformative Codes**
- Plunges reader into depth of giving love and divine identity
- Misrecognized as metaphysics or gnostic interpretation

**Iconic Quality of Gospel of John**
- Subtlety, simplicity due to primary figure's insights
- Intended for readers to embrace condition of Beloved Disciple.


#### Icon analysis: Sinai Christ's asymmetry and semiotics in Christian art and scripture

**Characteristics of Icons and Comparison to Text**
- **Lines of signification**: Compared to characteristics of icons
- Effects that bring viewer into communion with subject
  - Circular motion, gaze of face, exaggerated physical form, minimal relation in space to other figures
- Icon's ability to turn gaze back on beholder
- Asymmetry in Sinai Christ icon: deliberate unbalanced features (serene vs. disturbed side)
  - Right brain receives information about moods from left side of face
  - Transposition reveals disturbing effect, yet attention is drawn to right side
- Effect produces Marion's infinite gaze of the icon
- Dialectic or circular collapse of violence into peace in revelation of God's nonviolence

**Iconography vs. Symbolism**
- Iconography: focus on techniques that move eye beyond surface, spiritual depth
- Symbolism: less specific, can be found throughout Gospel of John

**Lord's Supper and Semiotics**
- Bread and wine as final demonstration of semiotics in Gospel of John
- No narrative of institution of Eucharist; instead, "Bread of Life" discourse as powerful commentary on its meaning
  - Reveals how meal intends community enactment of semiotic slippage
  - Day-to-day conscious formation of meaning.


#### A radical reinterpretation of Jesus's identity as the Bread of Life, challenging biblical taboos on consumption of flesh and blood.

**The Significance of Jesus's Miracles and Bread of Life Discourse**

**Jesus as Messiah**:
- Dramatic proof of Jesus's status as Messiah
- Followed by people's attempt to make him king

**Misunderstanding the Miracles**:
- People misunderstand the meaning behind the miracles
- They focus on the external miracles, not the interpretation

**Bread of Life Discourse**:
- Provides the interpretation of Jesus's signs and miracles
- Identifies Jesus with the bread or manna supplied by God

**Symbolism of the Loaves Multiplication**:
- Represents Jesus's self-surrender and giving, like the Eucharist
- Comments on each other reciprocally, creating "iconic doubling"
- Represents the power of feeding as self-giving and nonviolence

**Divine Claims of Jesus**:
- Identified with the bread of life
- Offends against human sensibility and biblical prohibitions on eating blood

**The Function of Transgressive Language**:
- Undoes primitive semiotic boundaries against human violence
- Signals radical human freedom from violence, bringing intimacy
- Requires divine revelation to be in sympathy with nonviolence

**Girardian Reading and Divine Revelation**:
- Represents the slippage of the icon's revolutionary oscillation
- Transforms all human and divine meaning through the nonviolent self-giving of bread and wine.


#### Exploring the role of Mary Magdalene in John's Gospel and the semiosis of the empty tomb

**The Beloved Disciple and Mary Magdalene in John's Gospel**

**Elements of the Narrative**:
- The Beloved Disciple runs to the tomb on Easter Sunday, outracing Simon Peter
- Mary Magdalene goes to the tomb while it was still dark and informs the disciples
- Mary disappears from the narrative, then reappears in the encounter with Jesus in "the garden"
- The Beloved Disciple looks in the tomb first, defers to Peter, and then evaporates, leaving a named disciple (Mary Magdalene) in view

**Analysis of the Narrative**:
- Mary Magdalene is a crucial conduit or relay to resurrection faith in all gospel accounts
- In John's Gospel, she returns with Peter and then the same sequence as in John occurs (Peter "running" to the tomb)
- It seems unreasonable that Mary did not herself look into the tomb when the Beloved Disciple and Peter did
- The Fourth Gospel has subtly shaded out Mary as the actual first witness of the contents of the tomb, substituting the anonymous "Beloved Disciple" and Peter
- **The belief in the disciple is not yet the full Easter faith**, but it could be the mental environment and semiosis that is beginning to shape emerging Christian truth
- The primary information around the tomb does not display anger and revenge, but rather a quiet, feminine and domestic "rolling up" of a piece of cloth
- This quietness or gentleness in the midst of absolute life-giving power begins to elicit a transformative response, the revolutionary relation of nonviolence that the semiotics of the gospel bring to the world

**Implications**:
- The signs of bread and wine in the early Christian community could not overcome their intrinsic scandal without this special nexus, including the emptying out of all semiosis of violence
- The Fourth Gospel presents the gospel's proto-semiosis experienced by the Beloved Disciple (probably Mary Magdalene)
- Any signs coming out of this Gospel, including the flesh and blood of the Son of Man as food and drink, are continuous with the signs of the empty tomb, the first dawn, and the absence of violence


#### Exploring John's Gospel: Semiotics and Transformative Christology.

**John's Gospel and Early Christian Theology**
* **John's Gospel**: Considered the "gold standard" of modern scholarship
* Reconstructed stages in John's community:
  1. Disciples of John the Baptist, loyal to him
  2. Jews with anti-temple views and Samaritan converts, bringing "high Christology"
  3. Gentile converts with a more universal or cosmopolitan viewpoint
* Distinctions among Jewish believers:
  - Those who embraced faith in Jesus but avoided breaking with the synagogue
  - Those who balked at the radicalism of Jesus as complete replacement of Abraham and Moses
* **Schneiders' Work**: Provides a feminist perspective, focusing on "symbolism" in John's Gospel
* **Brown's Community of the Beloved Disciple**: Identifies 22 candidates for the role of the "Beloved Disciple"
* **Divine Identity of Jesus**: Emerged in John with a dynamic rooted in a change in semiosis, rather than abstract doctrine
* **Heterodox Writings**: Early and middle second century writings using John's Gospel
* **Women's Roles**: John's Gospel presents women in an extraordinarily positive light, with exceptional roles as witnesses and leaders
* **Semiotics and Rhetorical Criticism**: Tracing semiotic connections allows for a more explicit understanding of the transformation from violence to revelatory nonviolence
* **Passive Undergoing**: The essential principle of transformation requires a passive "school" of beloved discipleship, which infects universal semiosis.
* **Pneumatological Aspect**: The transformation of violence into gentleness becomes an active indwelling of the nonviolent Holy Spirit, leading to theosis or divinization of the human.
