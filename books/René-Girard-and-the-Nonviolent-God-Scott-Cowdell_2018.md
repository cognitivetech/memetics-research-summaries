# René Girard And The Nonviolent God Scott Cowdell (2018)

> In his latest book on the ground-breaking work of René Girard (1923–2015), Scott Cowdell sets out a new perspective on mimetic theory and theology: he develops the proposed connection between Girardian thought and theological dramatic theory in new directions, engaging with issues of evolutionary suffering and divine providence, inclusive Christian uniqueness, God's judgment, nonviolent atonement, and the spiritual life. Cowdell reveals a powerful, illuminating, and life-enhancing synergy between mimetic theory and Christianity at its best.
> 
> With religion widely seen as increasingly violent and intransigent, the true Christian emphasis on divine solidarity, mercy, and healing is in danger of being lost. René Girard provides a countervailing voice. He emerges from Cowdell's study not only as a necessary dialogue partner for theology today, but as a global prophet offering hope and challenge in equal measure.
> 
> René Girard was a Catholic cultural theorist whose mimetic theory achieved a powerful symbiosis of social science with scripture and theology, yielding a unique perspective on humanity’s origins, violent history, and future prospects. Cowdell maps this synergy, revealing theological themes present from Girard’s earliest writings to the latest, less-familiar publications. He resolves a number of theological challenges to Girard’s work, engaging mimetic theory in fruitful dialogue with key themes, movements, and thinkers in theology today.
> 
> Bringing a distinctive Anglican voice to a largely Catholic debate, Cowdell gives an orthodox theological account of Girard’s intellectual achievement, bearing witness to Christianity’s nonviolent God. This book will be of great interest to theologians, seminarians and clergy of all traditions, Girardians, and Christian peace activists - [René Girard and the Nonviolent God Scott Cowdell](https://www.amazon.com/Ren%C3%A9-Girard-Nonviolent-Scott-Cowdell-ebook/dp/B07C859CC5?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

### 1. Overture to Mimetic Theory

**Mimetic Theory: An Overview of René Girard's Work**

**Background:**
- René Girard's work on mimetic theory developed over several stages
- Based on interdividual desire, scapegoating, and Judeo-Christian breakthrough
- Influenced by European novels and literary criticism

**Early Girard: Discoveries in Novels and Conversion Experience**
- Focus on understanding the human condition through literature
- Modern individuals' desires are borrowed, not original or authentic
- Awareness of this discovery in 19th century French literature (individualism as shifting Egos)
- First book: Mensonge romantique et vérité romanesque (Deceit, Desire, and the Novel, 1965)

**Middle Girard:** Theorizing Religion and Judeo-Christian Breakthrough (late 1970s to 1990s)
- Further exploration of mimetic theory's implications for religion
- Judeo-Christian breakthrough as door to secular modernity

**Late Girard:** Positive Aspects of Sacrifice and Apocalyptic Intimations (hominization and apocalypse)
- Acknowledgment of the positive aspect to sacrifice
- Filling in gaps regarding humanity's beginning and end

**Early Mimetic Theory: Great European Novels**
- Focus on understanding human condition through literature
- Modern individuals' desires are borrowed, not original or authentic (individualism as shifting Egos)
- Discoveries in 19th century French novels led to novelistic conversion experience for Girard.


#### Exploring desire's origins: René Girard on mediated desires and false transcendence in literature

**Girard's Account of Desire:**
- Girard offers a nuanced account of borrowed desire
- Identified various reifications of desire from Cervantes to Proust
- Key idea: Object focus of desire is secondary to the "model" or "mediator" who awakens it
- Desire focused on the being, not just object, of the model (metaphysical desire)
- Acquisition fails to satisfy as proxies only represent elusive being of the model
- Envy averted in "external mediation," leading to mimetic doubles and monstrous rivals in "internal mediation"
- Modern equality leads to more internal mediation and envy (acquisitive mimesis)

**Girard's Contrast between Desire and Transcendence:**
- False sacred: deviated transcendence, caricature of vertical transcedence
- Proust's steeple at Combray as axis mundi for human and earthly gods
- Steeple represents deviated transcendence in Proust's world of Combray
- Distance from the mystic center increases agitation, frenzy, futility
- Movement illustrated by crows circulating from steeple and returning pacified
- Reality becomes "deadly no more but benign," foreshadowing genuine transcendence in Girard's theory.


#### Mimetic Theory: Desire, Scapegoats, and Modern Western Restlessness.

**Girard's Insights on Desire and Sacrifice: Early Work**

**Proust's "Deadly No More but Benign"**
- Reminiscent of Girard's development of scapegoat mechanism
- Verdurins mock Saniette, later praised by same circles
- Comparison to sacred kingship in anthropological evidence for sacrificial mechanism
- Text contains insights on ultimate divinization of victim and victimary nature of monarchy (Girard, 2007)

**Dostoyevsky's "The Eternal Husband"**
- Examples of romantic self-immolation in early work
- Masochism and sadism as mimetic conditions (Gardner, 2016)
- Connection to desire's connection to its model leading to disappointment
- Frustrated acquisitiveness escalates, shifting from model to model

**Metaphysical Desire and Ontological Sickness**
- Dostoyevsky's "Notes from the Underground" and "Crime and Punishment"
- Rooted in desire to create oneself using being of a worthy other
- Modern myth of detachment and autonomy despite reliance on others (Girard, 1963)

**Apocalyptic Dimension and Sacrificial Motifs**
- Present in Girard's early work, later fully explored in "Achever Clausewitz" (2007)
- Observation of mutually slavish copying leading to destruction (Girard, 1985)
- Convergence towards the Dostoyevskian apocalypse in novelistic literature.


#### Girard's conversion and the role of Christian symbolism in literature.

**René Girard's Intellectual Breakthrough: From Mimesis to Christian Conversion**

**Girard's Insights on Alienation and Renunciation:**
- Recognized a path beyond "infernal pride" and mimetic charade through writers' conversions
- Transition from rivalry to acceptance of the flawed other marks renunciation of dysfunctional desiring
- Great novels depict this transition, inviting readers' own conversion

**Girard's Conversion: Parallels Between Literary and Religious Experience:**
- Draws parallels between Stepan Verkhovensky from Dostoyevsky's Devils and his own intellectual breakthrough
- Renewed interest in Christian symbolism following conversion to Catholic Church
- Seeing the "form" of Christ as integral to Western art and human experience

**Symbolic Elements in Great Novels:**
- Resurrection and immortality are indispensable elements for spiritual healing
- Rejection of human mediator and renunciation of deviated transcendency call for symbols of vertical transcendency, whether the author is Christian or not
- The form of Christ appears in Dostoyevsky's works, representing the highest pitch of his genius.

**Christ as Logos: Rational and Revelatory:**
- Christ, as the Logos, is at once rational and revelatory, judging and converting
- Rejected in favor of other means for securing human order and meaning
- This message is found in the Gospel of John's prologue.


#### Girard's "early work": Mimetic desire, conversion, and the form of Christ in literature

**Girard's Understanding of Christ: Literary Figurae and Conversion**

**Girard on Christ**
- Connected to literary figurae recalling death and resurrection
- Christian symbolism gives form to the experience of the novel

**Early Girard and The Glory of the Lord**
- Balthasar did not recognize Girard's commitment to discerning the form of Christ in Western culture
- Girard's conversion in 1959: a single, dense insight
- Discovery of deviated transcendence and letting go of quasi-sacred being

**Transformed Desire and Conversion**
- Proust and Dostoyevsky's novelistic experiences related to Christianity
- Phaedra's realization: John the Baptist knew Christ was not the light
- Dostoyevsky diagnosed modern desire's problematic and its solution

**Apocalypse, Freedom, and Choice**
- Modern Western life marked by prideful insistence on division and conflict
- Girard's assessment of modern conditions: a path of free choice
- Wrong choices lead to cultural apocalypse, allowing for redemption through Christ

**Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor**
- Divine love allows modern world to experience meaninglessness and violence
- Revealing the need to choose for or against Christ.

**Implications and Spiritual Theology**
- Girard's work compatible with a spiritual theology

### 2. From Violence to Divinity

**René Girard's Middle Period: Violence and the Sacred (1972), Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World (1978), and The Scapegoat (1982)**

**Background:**
- René Girard searches for understanding of human collectivity through myth analysis
- Discovered borrowed nature of desire in modern literature, now studies anthropology and ethnography
- Focuses on communal structures and scapegoating

**Key Insights:**
- Sacrifice essential for deflecting human violence
- Violence is heart of sacred
- Greek tragedy reveals social crises and their resolution through sacrifice
- Surrogate victim mechanism: disease and cure
- No society without religion as it resolves mimetic crisis through sacrifice

**Violence and the Sacred (1972):**
- Discusses role of sacrifice in human groups
- Violence is uniquely mimetic, heart of sacred
- Impurity and taboo explained as avoidance of mimetic escalation
- Ritual as a strategy for heading off violent crises
- Greek tragedy reveals social crises and their resolution through sacrifice

**Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World (1978):**
- Blurring of normal cultural boundaries in archaic festivals
- Dionysian ritual culminates in actual dismemberment
- Sacred aspect of sacrifice: resolution of group violence

**The Scapegoat (1982):**
- Scapegoat absorbs group's escalating violence
- Represents cathartic resolution of that violence.

**Significance:**
- Violence and the sacred, things hidden, and the scapegoat are crucial works in understanding Girard's middle period thought.
- These texts explore how violence is both disease and cure through sacrifice and scapegoating mechanisms.
- Sacred aspects of primitive religion identified as violence in its destructive and healing aspects.
- No society can exist without religion, as it resolves mimetic crisis through sacrifice.


#### The role of the scapegoat in religion and social stability (René Girard)

**Girard's Theory of Religion: Violence and Sacred Rites**

**Key Features:**
- Arbitrary choice of surrogate victim behind all sacred manifestations
- Cathartic, sacrificial "violence is venerated" for offering peace
- Identity of violence and the sacred in later ritual substitutions
- Surrogate victim mechanism reconciles mimetic oppositions
- Unity of all rites equated with social stability in premodern contexts

**Evidence and Criteria:**
- Covers all items claimed, offers function, structure, and coherence to primitive institutions
- Allows organization and assessment of ethnological data in economical manner
- Applies to every conceivable situation: stone rejected by builders becoming cornerstone

**Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World:**
- Magnum opus on Judeo-Christian breakthrough, desire, and secular modernity
- Identification of slain victim as transcendental signifier in Things Hidden
- Double transference: blame and deliverance ascribed to victim
- Sacred and confer total responsibility for event on the victim

**The Scapegoat:**
- Developments on social functioning of religion
- Failure of anti-Semitic persecution texts as myths (desacralization)
- Three stereotypes in medieval persecution texts: crisis, crime, criteria
- Reveals actual victims buried in mythology.


#### René Girard's analysis of religion, sacrifice, and violence in mythology and scripture.

**Girard's Account of Religion and Culture**

**Implications of Collective Persecutions**:
- Implies an as yet concealed relationship between collective persecutions and the culture as a whole
- Never explained by any linguist, philosopher, or politician

**The Scapegoat**:
- Detailed parsing of world mythology
- Reveals Girard's three stereotypes of persecution at work, under erasure
- Provides credence to Girard's claim of solving the fundamental enigma of all mythology

**Criticism of Girard**:
- Wittgensteinian philosopher Peter Winch dismisses Girard's comprehensive approach as sinning against relativism and the perspectival nature of truth
- Girard dismisses such "small intellectual ambitions" with contempt

**Girard's Interpretation of the Bible**:
- From the Sacred to the Secular via the Prophets and the Gospels
- Reveals the violent mechanism of the false sacred in its overcoming
- The Bible's desacralizing, secularizing impulse is owed to the Bible itself

**Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World**:
- Turns to the Hebrew scriptures and their mythological elements
- Identifies the prophets as calling into question the three pillars of sacrificial religion and the false sacred
- Affirms the superiority of Old Testament law and prophets over mythology, representing a genuine signpost to the gospel
- Sees Jesus's mission as revealing the sacrificial truth hidden since the foundation of the world

**The Gospels and Reconciliation**:
- The gospel mandates an entirely non-sacrificial and nonviolent reading of reconciliation
- This "reconciliation allows God to reveal himself as he is, for the first time in human history"


#### Exploring Girard's perspective on the role of violence in religion and the apocalyptic implications of Jesus' teachings.

**René Girard and the Nonviolent God**

**Overview:**
- Girard's perspective: victims assassinated since foundation of world revealed through Jesus' Resurrection
- Overcoming false sacred through apocalyptic revelation
- Human culture as bond of sacrificial violence
- Kingdom of God: opportunity to be freed from stability-maintaining violence, obligation to seize opportunity

**Girard's View on Victims and Resurrection:**
- Assassinated victims returning on earth
- Revealed completely with Jesus' Resurrection
- Prison of scapegoating overcome by divine help (resurrection)

**Apocalyptic Dimension:**
- Central part of Girard's thought as real anthropological category
- Revelation of victim and its destabilizing impact on world
- Overcome: traditional understanding of apocalyptic in terms of divine violence, modernity's "lengthy decomposition" of city of man

**Sacred Violence:**
- Discovered through revelation of false sacred
- God's doing through disruptive effect on culture (crucifixion)
- Human agency escalates violence if they turn down peace offered by Jesus

**Theological Considerations:**
- Méconnaissance (misunderstanding) before revelation not evil, but returning to it after revelation is reckoned as such
- Role of Jesus' death for world's deliverance from violence: necessary, despite commitment to nonviolent atonement theory
- Virginal conception of Jesus signifies his independence from the violence at root of human culture.

**Significant Resources for Reappraisal and Affirmation:**
- Traditional theological orthodoxy in nonviolent terms
- Elaboration of mimetic theory as significant resources for reappraisal and affirmation of traditional theological orthodoxy

**Criticism of Christianity's Regressions and Modernity:**
- Various regressions of historical Christianity to a sacrificial version of its best self
- Secular modernity shoring itself up by sacrificing religiously based laws, including Christianity itself.

**Symbolic Attack on the Gospel:**
- Unified opposition against it
- Last protection offered by religious law is now attacking the Gospel symbolically.

**Similarity of Law and Gospel:**
- Joint function of averting sacrificial crisis, achieved differently.


#### Girard's analysis of scapegoat mechanism in Christianity and nonviolent divinity.

**René Girard and the Nonviolent God**

**Girard's View on Christ**:
- Christ is the truth of the laws of all societies
- Rejecting the protection of law or gospel will not end well

**Details from The Scapegoat**:
- Victims often found support from one group, while Jesus was betrayed by everyone
- "They know not what they do" in their sacrificial unanimity
- Sacrifice is inscribed in the logic of internal mediation
- Mimetic desire drives violent mimetic unanimity

**Resurrection Insights**:
- Jesus's resurrection was distinguished from a typical pagan, false-sacred understanding
- The concrete reality of Jesus's resurrection is entailed by Girard's account
- The resurrection was not the contrivance of any human group

**Girard's Affirmation of the Supernatural**:
- The most miraculous aspect of the Gospels is their revelation of true divinity through outing and overcoming the false sacred
- The Gerasene demoniac story illustrates how the sacrificial order is undone, exposing and disempowering the false-sacred reality

**Revelation of Innocent Victims**:
- Innocent victims were rehabilitated before Christianity, not only in the passion stories
- The criterion for "Christian uniqueness" is not originality but reach and impact


#### René Girard's "Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World" - Mimetic theory, violence, scapegoating, and redemption.

**René Girard's Insights on Humanity and Mimesis: Middle Period**

**Girard's Understanding of Human Origins and Motivations:**
- Proposes that the mimetic nature of animals passes a threshold, leading to the emergence of properly human desire and mimetic rivalry
- Sacrificial victim as the transcendental signifier, essential for language and culture development

**Mimetic Theory in Modern Psychological Experience:**
- Integrates major aspects of mimetic theory: apocalyptic implications from Gospels, psychopathology interdividually
- Explores modern travails and increasing prevalence of psychopathological symptoms due to advancing desacralization
- Links neuroses and psychoses to interdividual dynamics, rivalrous doubles, and obstacles
- Madness as a socially sanctioned means for refusing to integrate rivalrous doubles or face the truth about mimetic condition

**Insights on Narcissism, Modern Creativity, and Mental Health:**
- Narcissism linked with modern nihilism, avant-garde, and revolutionary movements that oppress instead of liberate
- Places madness and sanity on a sliding mimetic scale
- Unprecedented harvest of modern creativity when unintegrated mimetic dynamics do not lead to psychological collapse

**Passing Beyond Mimetic Entrapment:**
- Conversion of perspective is key to escaping rivalry and self-defining condition, as well as illusory self-sufficiency
- Benefits from false sacred are largely exhausted, but God in Gospels has no violence in him
- Jesus's yoke is easy and his burden light, making him a model of desire free from mimetic rivalry.


#### Exploring Nietzsche's psychological unraveling through mimetic theory and Christianity's impact on modernity.

**Middle Girard: Nietzsche, Modernity, and Madness**

**Nietzsche as a Prophet of the Gospel's Implications for Modernity**
- Nietzsche recognized Christianity's true nature in Ecce Homo
  - Christ concerned for victims vs. sacrificial gods
  - Christians secretly resent this solicitude as "weakness"
- Nietzsche submitted to ressentiment, directing it against Wagner
- Girard sees Nietzsche's work as a prophetic grasp of Christianity's impact on modernity

**Nietzsche and the False Sacred**
- Nietzsche understood the "death of God" as the desacralizing process brought about by Christian revelation
- False sacrificial gods are dying, not the Christian God
- New festivals of atonement needed to replace old false religion
- Christ's sword destructive of human culture is what ends the eternal recurrence

**Girard's Analysis of Nietzsche's Work**
- Nietzsche was a gambler seeking escape from Christian revelation in his work
- Nietzsche's understanding of Christianity represents a major historical moment and triumph of biblical interpretation
- False sacred will seek to return, but its success will be limited due to the founding murder revealed by Christ

**Girard on Nietzsche's Insanity**
- Girard reflects on how Nietzsche was unable to reconcile mimetic doubles within his own self (Dionysus and the Crucified)

#### Exploring René Girard's thoughts on human evolution and mimetic theory, including hominization, scapegoat mechanism, and original sin.

**Girard's View on Hominization: From Animal Rites to Human Society**

**Background:**
- Admitting earlier thoughts on hominization as tentative but significant for mimetic theory (Girard, Adams)
- Human sociality described as sacrificially mimetic and mediated by surrogate victim

**Mimesis and Instinctual Patterns**:
- Aggravates and disorganizes instinctual patterns, e.g., animal rites
- Path from animal rites to human society hinges on scapegoat mechanism

**The Sacred Victim:**
- Shift into symbolic universe of human sociality via primary symbol: a slain victim
- Defense against theological criticism for this position on human origins

**Hominization and Consciousness**:
- Possible ascription of nascent human consciousness to mimetic rivalry (Girard, Dumouchel)
- Questions about compatibility with original goodness of creation

**Late Girard's Perspective:**
- Evolution of group fitness among proto-humans through scapegoat mechanism
- Emergence of the sacred victim as center of signification and initial instability resolution
- Gradual process of complexity awaiting an initial center of signification (Girard, Evoluation and Conversion)

**Hominization: A Return on the Theory of Darwin**:
- Filling in gaps in standard account of hominization with mimetic theory
- Scapegoat mechanism as a source of 'good' biological and cultural mutations (Girard, The One by Whom Scandal Comes)

**Drivers of Hominization:**
- Heightened mimeticism coupled with increasing brain size leading to crisis point and violence threat against the group.

**Original Sin**:
- Description of mimetic escalation to violence and archaic religion as a solution (Girard, The One by Whom Scandal Comes)
- Raising questions about Christian orthodoxy.


#### Exploring René Girard's perspective on human origins, fall, and the role of violence in religions.

**Girard's Perspective on Humanity's Origin:**
* Girard's position is an "Augustinian reaction against excess of humanism"
* Humans were originally bearers of a morally innocent mimetic nature, evolved from less advanced animal species
* Forebears spun out of control towards violently mimetic annihilation and were saved by the discharge of pent-up violence onto a scapegoat: "the fall"

**The False Sacred and its Legacy:**
* Archaic dispensation is a stage on the way to a fuller revelation
* The term "satanic" applies only to the world that comes after Christian revelocation
* Archaic religions were legitimate in their place and time, but became illegitimate once their lie was exposed
* This does not amount to an endorsement of archaic cultures' violence according to modern standards.

**Girard's Developments and Orthodox Christian Understanding:**
* Girard makes dogmatic statements about Christ, Trinity, and the church in terms of mimetic theory
* He arrives at a more integral understanding of the sacrificial, which is an unavoidable reality with positive as well as negative aspects.

**Quotes:**
* "The original sin is the bad use of mimesis" (Girard)
* "There is in the modern mind a romanticizing attitude in respect to the prehistoric world" (Girard)
* "Archaic religions were legitimate in their place and time; they became illegitimate only from the moment that their lie was exposed" (Girard).


#### Girard's perspective on God, sacrificial violence, and human history

**René Girard's Perspective on God and Violence**

**Girard's Answer to Michel Tregeur:**
- God's existence doesn't change anything for mimetic theory or Jesus' moral teaching validity
- Ancient religions were a first path towards God, with sacrifices keeping violence at a tolerable level
- Jesus is not a novum but the crucial link in divine revelation
- Christian revelation confirms all religions in their relation to the divine

**God's Accommodation to Humanity:**
- God uses human violence for humanity's development and eventual teachings of love
- Distinction between earthly 'powers and principalities' and celestial ones
- Earthly powers have a sacred aura, while celestial powers emphasize their extraterrestrial nature
- Satan becomes devalued through Christ's intervention, but not condemned

**Archaic Religion and Violence:**
- Archaic religion is not satanic but necessary for humanity's survival and development
- False-sacred legacy becomes satanic when prosecuted against Judeo-Christian revelation
- Powers and principalities refer to both earthly and supernatural entities, with a sacred aura.


#### Girard's thoughts on satanic sacred, false sacred, and religious institutions. Girard distinguishes between the original satanic sacred and its later religious manifestations while also discussing the concept of katéchon in the Christian context. He explores the role of violence and limitation in maintaining stability, and his evolving perspective on sacrifice in understanding the gospel.

**Girard's Distinction Between Satanic Sacred and Religious Structures**
* **Archaic sacred**: "Satanic" when unchanneled, requires social institutions to maintain order until Kingdom of God (Evolution and Conversion)
	+ Not sacred in same sense as false sacred (miraculous unity of a community)
	+ Distinction between highly charged sacred origins and subsequent religious developments
* **Religious structures**: Emerged from false sacred to preserve cultural entity, not satanic but not good either
* **Satanic capacity**: Remains ability to stir up disorder in worldly affairs

**Katéchon: Interim Measure Maintaining Stability of World**
* References to "that which restrains" and "the restrainer" (2 Thessalonians 2:6,7)
* Associated with God's providence, ordering authority, rule of law, military
* Distinguished from false-sacred scapegoat mechanism by Girard
* Limited role in Christian dispensation to maintain stability after revelation has exposed satanic mechanism

**Girard's Realpolitik and Pacifism**
* Pragmatic approach: Prevention of violence requires some level of violence (Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World)
* Not an unconditional pacifist, acknowledges danger of pacifism becoming antagonistic mimetic double of oppression.


#### Girard's evolution from anti-sacrificial stance to acknowledging positive sacrificial aspects in Christianity.

**Girard's Shift on Sacrifice:**
* Girard recognizes Jesus's death as a witness against false- sacred violence and necessary for humanity's liberation
* Struggles to see it as positive sacrifice in early work (Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World)
* Admits to scapegoating sacrifice and Hebrews due to humanistic illusion
* New realization: distinction between immolation-by-others and consecration-on-behalf-of-others
* Insight comes from Paul's image of moving on from baby food to mature food where one sacrifices oneself not to harm neighbor
* Applies this new understanding to the Old Testament story of Solomon judging two prostitutes, realizing mother's willingness to give up child for truth is a form of sacrifice
* Reevaluates his earlier dismissal of sacrificial language in Christian texts, including Hebrews

**Girard on Sacrifice:**
* Recognizes continuity between different types of sacrifice
* Archaic religions reveal the category of sacrifice that is later exposed and reconfigured in Judeo-Christian revelation
* Christ's sacrifice recapitulates archaic religion, including primitive cannibalism
* Humanity has been rescued from violent future through Christ's sacrifice
* Choice to participate in self-sacrificial refusal of sacrificial violence offered by Christ.


#### René Girard's perspective on sacrifice: Inescapability, revelation, and societal collapse

**René Girard on Sacrifice and Redemption**

**Girard's Interpretation of the Bible Passage:**
- Old system of sacrifice finished: no longer obstacle to violence (1)
- Jesus's sacrifice offers new way for peace (2)
- No escape from sacrifice in language or culture (3)
- Sacrifice's risk and ambiguity remain (4)
- Christianity reveals the nature of sacrificial mechanisms (5)
- False sacred systems eventually collapse (6)
- Jesus accelerates collapse, providing alternative outcome (7)

**Key Insights:**
1. Sacrifice is an inherent part of culture and language that cannot be escaped completely.
2. The old system of sacrifice is finished; Jesus offers a new way for peace through his submission as a victim.
3. No purely social-scientific position can provide clear view of the sacrificial due to our deep involvement in it.
4. We cannot have a non-sacrificial space from which to understand and explain everything without personal involvement.
5. The biblical revelation undoes an ersatz, false-sacred peace by revealing its limitations.
6. False sacred systems eventually collapse of their own accord or through Jesus's revelation.
7. Jesus provides the only way to avoid apocalyptic outcome by offering an alternative outcome for civilization.
8. God allowed Satan to reign over humanity before Christ came to overcome him through his death on the cross (optional, more declaratively theological).

**Girard's Development of Thought:**
- Early Girard: "ontological sickness" and descent into metaphysical desire necessary for understanding condition
- Middle Girard: revelation undoes false sacred peace; Old Testament revelation begins denaturing false sacred
- Late Girard: Jesus accelerates collapse of civilization but provides an alternative outcome.

**Passage from I See Satan Fall Like Lightning:**
- God allowed Satan to reign for a certain period over humanity
- Christ overcame adversary by dying on the cross (optional, more declaratively theological)
- Revealed the limitations of false sacred peace
- Collapse of false sacred systems occurs naturally or through Jesus's revelation.


#### René Girard's thoughts on modernity, apocalypse, and the role of sacrifice.

**René Girard's Perspective on God, Modernity, and Apocalypse:**
* **God's Foreknowledge vs. Will**: Girard suggests that when he says God foreknew humanity's salvation or destruction, it may mean He wills humanity's salvation but not abandonment to unavoidable consequences. This is not an admission of violence as ultimate or ontological.
* **Modernity and Apocalypse**: Modern society is both the fruit of revelation and the birth pangs of apocalypse according to Girard. He sees modernity as apocalyptic because it exposes culture's foundations derived from scapegoating, yet also reveals opportunities for equality and potentially unrestrained conflict.
* **Nietzsche and Apocalypse**: Nietzsche is both the prophet and nemesis of this development, seeking to restore the false sacred in a post-Christian era but dismissed by Girard as promoting the ideology of internal mimetic desire.
* **Modernity's Illusions**: Modern society appears individualistic and diverse, yet it is based on illusion according to Girard. What we fear is not difference but the deeper undifferentiation that lies beneath our apparent fear of the other and modern insistence on celebrating diversity.
* **Distinctiveness and Undifferentiation**: In an emerging global monoculture, it will be important to restore differentiation where possible as consumer capitalism defuses mimetic rivalry positively. Girard describes this as a mixed reality where archaic sacred social defenses are removed while they sneak back under cover of Christianity and its modern humanistic legacy.
* **Modern Obsession with Victims**: Modern society has an appetite for manufacturing new victims, often selecting them from among the victimizers to justify persecuting them. This widespread victim obsession is described as the "circular firing squad of modern victimology" and interpreted as the sacrificial spirit of archaic religiosity taking its last stand.
* **Zombie Fiction**: Provides a ritual slaughter of undifferentiated victims and victimizers to preserve civilization, though the sacrifices are already dead.


#### Exploring René Girard's perspective on Western society, imitation, and violence.

**The Mimetic Impulse and Secular Modernity**

**Mimetic Conflict and Abatement of Desire**:
- In today's West, there is a decline in robust desire
- This is attributed to the "exhaustion of the mimetic impulse"
- The addiction to pornography is seen as a consequence of this lack of desire

**Undifferentiation in Secular Modernity**:
- Contemporary individuals are not strong enough to have mimetic desire
- They are "socially indifferent human beings unable to communicate with each other and mainly concerned with what is strictly accountable in their life, in the sense of self-interest"
- This is a "radical form of nihilism"

**Geopolitical Manifestations**:
- The "clash of civilizations" may be better understood as "civil wars within the one, increasingly undifferentiated global monoculture"
- Militant Islamists' hatred of the West is not a matter of rivalry with difference and otherness, but rather an adoption of the West's values without admitting it to themselves
- The West's fascination with difference (e.g., multiculturalism) is a "stratagem for maintaining sufficient differentiation between the West and the rest"

**Oscillating Western Self-Flagellation**:
- The West has always sought to deny its "undifferentiation" with primitive cultures
- This is evident in colonialist arrogance giving way to romanticizing the "noble savage"
- Today's multiculturalism allows the West to see itself as civilizing the violent primitive, obscuring the "universality of violence"

**Resurgent Primitive Violence**:
- The West's concern for victims was prophetically reflected in Nietzsche's zeal for the Dionysian over the Judeo-Christian preference for victims
- On the political left, there is a "resurgent Dionysian spirit" in attempts to outflank Christianity and claim superiority over it


#### Exploring René Girard's mimetic theory and its implications for understanding violence in modern history, religion, and society.

**Neo-paganism and Judeo-Christian Morality:**
- **Neo-paganism**: seeks to turn Ten Commandments and Judeo- Christian morality into alleged intolerable violence, aiming for their complete abolition.
- **Christian denominations**: vulnerable to neo-pagan blackmail due to failings in charity and connivance with established political orders.

**Girard's Analysis of Clausewitz:**
- Girard explores the dynamics of archaic violence making a return unrestrained in modern world since Napoleon and total war.
- No more rule-governed gentlemanly warfare but mass mobilization and civilian deaths, leading to "escalation to extremes."
- Clausewitz's On War: draws attention to shift from sacrificial efficacy for restoring peace in war.

**Mimetic Escalation:**
- From Napoleonic France vs Germany, to Germanys vs Russian Bolshevism, Nazism and Stalinism, Cold War.
- Drives modern history, characterizing late 20th century conflicts in Balkans, Rwanda, Middle East, subcontinent.
- Mimetic conflict also seen in violent rivalry of Western societies with environment.

**Girard's Insights on Contemporary Islamist Violence:**
- Radical Islam is an alternative version of modernity rather than an alternative to it; a civil war within one global civilization.
- Islam has not entirely freed itself from legacy of archaic violence, providing license for those wishing to depart from Qur'an's teachings on mercy and restraint of violence.

**Girard's View on History:**
- Confident that God's purposes are being worked out in history, not exhausted by Judeo-Christian revelation.
- Belief in peace of God passing all understanding, distinct from false-sacred peace understood through mimetic theory.
- Late Girard period: deepening insight into Judeo-Christian scriptures as alternative way of being apart from which he foresees a dark future for planet Earth.


### 4. Girard among the Theologians

**Girard's Theological Contributions**
- René Girard was not a theologian but contributed to theological discourse through his scholarship in humanities and social sciences
- His work aims to clarify and teach Christian faith, connecting it with modern audiences cut off from the Judeo-Christian tradition
- Girard's mimetic theory confirms orthodox Christian inclinations and reassures that human freedom before God is not compromised

**Mimetic Theory and Theology: Incarnational Paradox**
- Girard offers a "phenomenology of redemption" or "phenomenology of grace" through his mimetic theory
- Social science and scriptural revelation are linked in this approach
- Tension between theological claims being primary yet secondary in Girard's project

**Sacrifice, Scapegoating, and Divinity**
- Archaic divinity arises from efficacy of scapegoats; Christian divinity arises indirectly from their inefficacy
- Perfect scapegoat is both fully human and divine, offering a perfect sacrifice that ends all others
- Girard sees no neutral, social-scientific path to this insight apart from what the passion narratives reveal.


#### René Girard's Mimetic Theory and Christian Trinity: Divine Love and Human Relationality

**Girard's View on Scapegoating and Revelation**
- Social science cannot provide a comprehensive understanding of scapegoating mechanism
- **Christ is the only being** who can transcend false transcen-dence of violence
- **Resurrection** is a "spectacular sign" of the entrance of a power superior to violent contagion
- No mimetic theory for resurrection belief, but its anthropological and theological significance is coherent

**Girard's Affirmation of Christ's Impact**
- Continued dissemination of Jesus's impact is important
- **Paraclete** is the socio-historical vector of their impact
- Resurrection of Jesus differed from typical pagan unanimity and became decisive revelation of an alternative sacred

**Girard's Understanding of Trinity**
- **Trinity** emerges from work and person of Christ
- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the one God who corresponds to John's definition of God as love
- Intra-Trinitarian life described mimetically as patris tic doctrine of perichoresis

**Girard's View on Nonviolent God**
- Christian monotheism is not monolithic, it has a relationship inside itself
- Mystery exists beyond what can be articulated by human intelligence
- Reason and faith must be combined for a complete understanding of Christianity


#### René Girard's faith, mimetic theory, and Christian revelation: Unifying science and theology

**René Girard's Perspective on Christianity and Human Condition**

**Girard's Conviction**:
- Reformation led to modern atheism, but Girard sees Christianity as revealing power to illuminate human condition
- His intellectual and spiritual adventure is not only subjective

**Understanding of Christian Doctrine**:
- Christianity offers a superior understanding of human cultures compared to social sciences
- Interpretation of Gospels provides a new science or knowledge of humanity
- "Gospels read myth"

**Girard's Approach**:
- Widens reception of thought by avoiding supernatural explanations in anthropological analysis
- Preference for real science and scriptural hermeneutic
- Declares Gospels as part of new science or knowledge of humanity
- Believes in special Christian revelation but accepts it based on truth, not just faith

**Incarnation and Revelation**:
- Incarnate God revealed "in, with, and under" discoveries of social science
- Best literary and social-scientific insights point to incarnation
- Mimetic reading shows relevance by putting abstract idea of original sin into more concrete form

**Challenges to Girard's Orthodoxy**:
1. **Freedom of Will**: If mimesis forms an unbreakable web, how can traditional Christian belief in humanity's fundamental freedom be reconciled?
2. **Natural Knowledge of God**: Critics argue that Girard's scapegoat theory assumes ontological violence at the heart of reality, making any orthodox claim about basic goodness of creation untenable.
3. **Original Paradise**: Some critics point out that Girard has nothing to say about an original paradise or Genesis creation narratives and their doctrinal elucidation.


#### A philosophical discussion on Mimetic Theory, human freedom, and desire's relationship to God.

**Mimetic Theory and Divine Grace**

**Lenehan's Assessment**:
- Girard's theory explains the process of hominization and cultural generation through mimesis and managing reciprocal violence
- However, it does not provide an explicit understanding of God's purpose or intention for humanity in this process, or the nature of the relationship between creator and creation

**Girard's Interview with Rebecca Adams**:
- Girard recognized that mimetic desire can become evil by stirring up rivalries, but it is not inherently bad
- Mimetic desire is good and necessary for accessing worthwhile models of right desiring

**Girard on Mimesis and Freedom**:
- Mimesis is the sine qua non of human freedom
- Without mimetic desire, there could be neither freedom nor humanity
- Mimetic theory shows that in human affairs, the unpredictable is always possible

**Schwager's Critique and Response**:
- Schwager was concerned that Girard's account of mimetic entrapment proves incompatible with human freedom
- Girard counters by presenting mimesis as the sine qua non of human freedom
- Dumouchel's charge that Girard is "complex and ambiguous" on the subject of mimesis and violence is disputed

**Dumouchel's Systems Theory of Mimesis**:
- Mimesis emerges under the pressure of evolutionary selection as an algorithmic, almost cybernetic process
- Mimesis is a rivalrous dynamic that coincides with the appearance of desire at the level of individual motivation

**Girard and Dumouchel on Rivalry and Desire**:
- In the sacrificial crisis, rivalry shapes desire and violence has hold of both the subject and the object of that desire
- However, Girard identifies the seeds of this outcome in the standard focus of mimetic desire on the being of its model, which is prone to rivalry but not derivable from it


#### Mimetic desire and human consciousness: Rivalry's role in self-awareness and theological interpretations

**Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World by René Girard**

**Mimetic Desire and Human Freedom**
- **Ambiguous passage** in Things Hidden regarding human desire's emergence and rivalry's role
  - Mimesis interferes with animal instincts, leading to human desire
  - Hominization process involves mimetic functions and symbolic reorganization
  - Rivalry contributes to self-awareness, but does not necessitate conscious self-existence (contrary to some interpretations)

**Interpreting Girard's Passage**
- English translation may be misleading
- Original French text suggests awareness of self and other grow together with rivalry
- Ritual harnessed for productive ends
- Founding murder not mentioned, but hominization underway and protective sacrificial fruit in place
- Mimetic state possible before emergence of rivalrous desire on the cusp of hominization

**Girard and Schwager's Discussion on Theological Orthodoxy (1983)**
- Compromising of freedom in Girard's account of human desire resolved through Schwager's essay
- Proposed reconciliation: mimetic theory and theological orthodoxy can both be accommodated
  - Humanity quickly enslaved mimetically, obscuring genuine freedom zone between animal mimesis and entrapment.

**Girard's Personal Concerns (Letter to Schwager)**
- Desire for acceptance in Catholic theological circles
- Preservation of social-scientific commitments
- Emphasizes intuition over abstract concepts.


#### Exploring religious themes in René Girard's thought: mimesis, freedom, orthodoxy, Augustine, and influences on fundamental theology.

**Girard's Interpretation of Human Origins and Theology:**
* Girard clarifies his perspective on human origins: choice of divine model not made, leading to animalistic mimetic behavior (Natural mimesis) causing violence (101-102).
* Belief in freedom alongside mimetic desire and acknowledgement of theological orthodoxy.
* Impact on liberation theology due to focus on victim, exposing violently complicit religion.
* Affirmation of concrete social conditions in today's society.

**Influences and Synergies with Theologians:**
* Augustine: shared sense of creation as originally good but diverted by sin and awareness of human motivations.
* Negative theology: God revealed through Jesus’ death, outside sacred violence (Rowan Williams).
* Thinkers of the end of religion: focus on God's revelation over human constructions of meaning (Bonhoeffer, Weil, Girard).

**Girard and Augustine:**
* Borrowed nature of desire and deviated transcendence.
* Distinction between first- and second-rate authors.

**Girard and Simone Weil:**
* Shared sense of danger in deviated religiosity but differing views on Judaism.
* Influence acknowledged by Girard despite harsh assessment.

**Girard's Embrace of Church:**
* Discoveries led him to embrace the Church and active worship, despite being an outsider to institutional agenda.


#### Exploring connections between René Girard, Simone Weil, and Christian theology through their common themes of desire, mimetic dynamics, and redemption.

**Girard's Influence from Weil: Insights on Mimetics and Collective Conflicts**

**Early Reading of Weil (1955)**
- Impacted Girard's understanding of mimetics and collective conflicts
- Identified oscillations between enemies in tragic conflicts
- Understood the similarity between religious feelings and social belonging

**Weil's Key Concepts**
- Recognized precursors of Christian salvation in ancient literature
- Identified a feedback loop of antagonism leading to scapegoating resolution
- Emphasis on spiritual posture of passivity for world-transforming obedience

**Weil's Influence on Girard**
- Both recognized the need to abandon personal autonomy and conformist impulses
- Saw a counter-mimetic story emerging in history, only fully realized in Christ
- Emphasized the importance of self-dispossession and divine decreation

**Girard's Perspective**
- Insists on addressing wider world but illuminated by Gospels
- Anthropology is handmaiden to fundamentally theocentric-Christocentric perspective
- Sees himself as an anthropologist, not a theologian

**Assessment of Girard**
- Criticized for sacrificing theology to social science by some Christian thinkers
- Viewed as a pre-Christian Plato figure awaiting theological baptism by others
- Mongrain argues Girard is a "theologian of the cloistered heart" due to his focus on inner transformation and Christ's influence.

**Girard's Anthropology and Theology**
- Mongrain believes Girard's anthropology is fundamentally theocentric and Christocentric, despite being developed deductively from looking at parts of salvation history.
- Clearest advocate for Girard among the theologians is Kevin Mongrain.


#### Girard's Mimetic Theory: Mysticism, Renunciation, and Positive Undifferentiation in Christianity.

**Girard's Integration of Personal Transformation and Revelation/Redemption**
* Girard aligns with priorities of theological dramatic theory in integrating personal transformation into process of revelation and redemption
* Insight can lead to practical applications, such as those drawn from John Cassian's Conferences
	+ Analysis of obsessive mental habits
	+ Greater efficacy of allowing preoccupations to be displaced in contemplative prayer rather than self-consciously trying to fight them
* Satan as a projection of the system that provokes rivalry, not overcome through direct attacks but by developing true vision of reality
* Christian faith and ethics beyond conventional moralizing emphasizes other-dependence (Alison)
* Mimetic obsessions need exposure to Christ's desire, opened through habituated practice of contemplative prayer
* Disciplined attention to alternative model of desire instead of models that sustain obsessions
* Renunciation and creative love in Girardian imitatio and meditatio
	+ Importance of sharing in Christ's incarnate solidarity with all his "sheep" (ann Astell)
	+ Capacity to pass beyond judging others and live non-rivalrously and non-judgmentally.

**Girard, Theology, and Methodology:**
* Pluralistic discipline with contested methods in modern theology
* Two proposals for engaging with mimetic theory: Catholic (Lonergan) and Anglican
* Lonergan's attempt at unifying modern theology's complex methodological space
	+ Overtones made towards common cause with Girard.

**Girard and Theological Dramatic Theory:**
* Integration of personal transformation into process of revelation and redemption is a sign of Girard's alignment with priorities of theological dramatic theory.


#### Exploring affinities between Lonergan's method and Girard's mimetics in Christian theology.

**Girard and Lonergan: Similarities and Connections**

**Dynamic Nature of Experience:**
- Charles Hefling emphasizes Girard's focus on the dynamic nature of experience
- Compatibility with Lonergan's approach to theological method

**Understanding Humanity's Self-Deception:**
- Both Girard and Lonergan explore humanity's self-deception, rationalization, and complicity in lies

**Theological Methodology:**
- Lonergan's dynamic method resonates with Girardian emphases
- Aims for human intellectual, moral, and religious transformation
- Focuses on essential categories: research, interpretation, history, dialectics, foundations, doctrines

**Reality of Being Caught Up by God:**
- Center of gravity for Lonergan is being caught up by God into self-transcending love
- Deliverance from false religion and demonic destructiveness

**Newer Theological Method: Théologie Totale**
- Proposed by Sarah Coakley as an alternative to three main options in British theology
- Open to social science, but refuses reductionism
- Acknowledges the necessity of personal transformation for revelation understanding
- Draws gender and politics into understanding God while insisting on contemplation and mysticism
- Overcomes false divides between belief and practice, thought and affect, etc.

**Girard's Program and Théologie Totale:**
- Shares affinities with Coakley's proposal
- Healing of desire by properly repositioning it in the light of Trinitarian desire at the heart of both approaches

**Tensions Preserved in Théologie Totale:**
- Between forthright scientific realism and necessary revelation of God for understanding humanity
- Involvement of human desires in how God is conceived versus contemplative capacity to counter distortions.

**Girard's Commitments:**
- Introduced chapter by pointing out Girard's own commitments to theological task and orthodoxy.


### 5. A Divine-HumanDrama

**Girard's Perspective on Revelation:**
- **Divine revelation**: identified with overcoming violence among humans
- **Nonviolent God**: respects freedom and cannot be forcefully felt
- Criticized for gnostic tendencies by Balthasar
  - Lack of universal and participatory theory of revelation
  - Absence of mystical sense of God's glory

**Girard vs. Balthasar on Revelation:**
- Balthasar: revelation is more universal and participatory
- Girard: revelation contains "gnosis" but not gnostic tendencies
  - Reveals victim mechanism as false sacred is exposed
  - Transformation of history through concrete events (Jesus, new humanity)

**Characteristics of Girard's Revelation:**
- Initiates a process of re-reading
- Formal: reveals fundamental truth about humans and God
- Material: discloses truth that reverses cultural momentum concealing these truths

**Integral Relation Between Revelation and Salvation:**
- Not confined to Girardian movement or Catholicism
- Insight shared by Reformed theologians like Colin Gunton
  - Revelation a function of divine action achieving redemption
  - Human blindness and ignorance also removed.


#### Revelation and salvation through Girardian perspective: inseparable and transformative processes.

**Girard's Understanding of Revelation and Humanity**

**Girard's Perspective on Revelation**:
- Revelation is a function of salvation
- Not about sudden events, but the slow and painful coming-to-understand that unifies being with becoming conscious of one's sinfulness
- Transforms what it means to understand, not just to conceive

**Girard's Perspective on Humanity**:
- Revelation reveals the sacred victim complex in society
- Social sciences help Girard theorize this revelation in scripture

**Milbank's Critique of Girard**:
- Milbank claims Girard's account of human life and origins is solely indebted to the social sciences
- Suspects science as a debased form of knowledge that sunders reality
- Preferes an ideal, peaceful hierarchical order based on gift exchange

**Milbank vs. Girard on Desire**:
- Milbank criticizes Girard for debasing all desire as derivative and projecting modern liberal democracies onto human origins
- Misses the metaphysical psychology of mimetic desire in its attraction to the "being" of a model

**Girard's Response to Schwager**:
- Admits a natural desire for God at the beginning of human existence, but one that is immediately diverted toward human models
- Sees original sin as based on the fact that the natural desiderium naturale has been misdirected toward humans


#### Exploring Girard's Mimetic Theory through Theological Dramatic Theory: Revelation and Human Relationships

**René Girard and the Nonviolent God**

**Girard's Perspective on Mimesis**:
- Mimesis turned toward man is always already oriented toward idolatry
- Girard dismisses the Anglo-Catholic Milbank as too Catholic philosopher and insufficiently biblical
- Girard emphasizes the positive nature of mimesis as key to human sociality, communication, learning, and survival
- Mimesis is also involved in envy, rivalry, violence, and sacrificial restraint of violence

**Girard's Later Emphasis on "Good Mimesis"**:
- Girard begins to emphasize the positive nature of mimesis as the basis for healthy relationships both interpersonal and God-ward
- Suggestive of Trinitarian relations
- Milbank notes this acknowledgment of "good mimesis" in Girard's thinking from the early 1990s, but says Girard fails to explain it

**Girard's Theological Dramatic Theory**:
- Concerned with "reconstructed relationships" and how they conduct people into God's truth in Christ
- Compared to propositionalist theology that "dedramatizes Scripture"
- Drama allows a greater level of engagement with the audience, more of a conversation than one-way declamation
- Invites reexamination and broadening of revelational categories to better reflect a dynamic, two-way reality
- Symbolic understanding of revelation as a "saturated phenomenon" that cannot be reduced to its parts or neat boundaries

**Girard's Approach to Revelation**:
- Attends to Jesus's impact, recalling the insight of renewed historical Jesus studies
- Knowledge of Jesus Christ begins with the experienced impact of conversion by Jesus Christ
- Avoids the extrinsic account of revelation in Karl Barth and the forward-loading of revelation in Karl Rahner's theological anthropology


#### Exploring religious perspectives on God's revelation through dramatic lenses: Girard, Rahner, and Balthasar.

**Revelation and Theology: Drama as a Category**

**Background:**
- Wandinger acknowledges possibility of Christ's presence throughout history but not world-transforming
- Rahner's "transcendental anthropology" cannot yield sufficient critical distance between gospel and culture
- Girard sees God and human selves coming into full clarity only through the gospel of Jesus Christ

**Reception of Revelation:**
- Alison: Universal "Christoformity" found in people turning to the victim, not anonymous Christianity
- Dramatic approach improves understanding of revelation beyond modern options of theology "from above" and "below"

**Balthasar's Perspective:**
- Theology is "from within", not just "from above" or "below"
- God's initiative working through human openness and obedience in the Theo-drama

**Drama as a Category:**
- Drama conveys a sense of God's initiative, drawing together aspects from above and below
- Integrates genuine, episodic experience while retaining an overarching theme
- Provides closure through resolution of difficulties beyond straightforward theoretical version of closure

**Significance:**
- Drama as a theological category represents a potential improvement on narrative theology
- Suitable for doing justice to great and intense spiritual lives caught up in God's purposes.


#### Theological exploration of Girard's mimetic theory through a dramatic interpretation of salvation history. Girardian Theo-drama: Reconciling nonviolence, faith, and evolution.

**Girard's Theo-Drama: A Multi-Act Drama of Salvation History**

**Jesuit Meditation Method**:
- Involves imaginative placement into Gospel scenes to discern God's will
- Integrates intellect, affectivity, and volition
- Allows for discernment in the midst of disorienting uncertainties and conflicts
- Encourages participation in a larger divine drama

**Girard's Theological Schema**:
- Balthasar criticizes Girard's inability to structure the divine-human drama of salvation history
- However, Girard's approach integrates faith and reason
- Schwager argues that Girard's thought contributes to clarifying the issue of the kingdom of God and sacrificial redemption

**Three Narratives in Jesus Christ**:
- Violent human action against Jesus
- Jesus's faithful nonviolence
- God's purposes in history as violence yields to resurrection

**Reconciling Incompatible Theologies**:
- Resolves tension between theologies of the kingdom of God and redemption
- Holds together apparently discrepant emphases on judgment and mercy of God

**Girardian Theo-Drama: Five Acts**:
1. Pre-Human Paradise of Savage Innocence
   - Natural processes give rise to a habitable planet and emerging life
   - Includes natural selection, leading to animal suffering and death
2. Hominization, the Primal Murder, and Providence
   - Human beings emerge from mimetic entrapment and turn to rivalry and violence
   - The primal murder of Abel by Cain founds settled human existence
3. Salvation History: Jesus's Life, Death, and Resurrection
4. Post-Resurrection: Church and Eschatological Consummation
5. Cosmic History: From Creation to the Present


#### Mimetic theory's perspective on salvation history: Divine initiative and human response.

**The Religious Nexus of Prohibition/Myth/Ritual**
- Enabled the creation of stable larger-scale hominid communities
- Allowed for the emergence of Homo sapiens in the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods
- Divine providence holds humanity in being through a religio-cultural nexus based on a single-victim mechanism
- Violence deployed in homeopathic quantities to restrain worse violence

**The Breakthrough: The Revealing of the Holy God**
- Glimpses of awareness concerning sacrificial mechanism in Western antiquity and Eastern religions
- Revealed in the Hebrew scriptures and fully exposed in the passion and resurrection of Jesus Christ
- New way of being human emerges beyond false-sacred solidarity at the expense of victims

**The Modern Paradox: A World of Both Greater Good and Greater Evil**
- The Word makes its way through the wider cultural impact of Judeo-Christian revelation
- Holy Spirit undoes previously unquestioned antipathies and pathologies of violent exclusion
- Greater focus on human rights, justice, and forgiveness
- Threatens social cohesion as scapegoating loses its efficacy
- Escalation to extremes of military conflict, potentially leading to the end of human history

**The Un-Theorized Eschaton: The Triumph of Christ in a 'Beyond'**
- Affirms that the kingdom of God is not of this world
- Challenges the pagan eschatology of eternal return and disrupts a cyclical view of time
- Christian eschatological imagination promises final resolution of history's conflicts and peace
- The victory of Christ remains un-theorized by Girard, as it exists outside the purview of mimetic theory.


#### God's role in natural and historical processes: from sovereign actor to integral presence.

**God's Role in Hebrew Scriptures: Double Agency Perspective**

**Understanding God's Action**
- Not represented as one cause among others (process theology)
- Not sole cause of all events (Cartesian extremes, dualism)
- Normal course of things, not interruption or violation

**God in Hebrew Scriptures: Development and Transformation**
- Trajectory from God causing bad outcomes to understanding natural consequences
- Divine punishment comes from reciprocity and mimetic desire
- Double agency perspective emerges with emphasis on divine transcendence giving way to a newer version of sacred transcendence

**Christian Perspective: Jesus as God in Human Form**
- Jesus's divine message and acts rooted in everyday life
- Perfect accord between God fully at home in human life (Chalcedon Council)

**Double Agency Tradition: Shaping the Tradition**
- Irenaeus: God deals gently, immanent creator
- Origen: Respects world's integrity, completion involving enfleshed Logos
- Gregory of Nyssa: God permeating creation, holding it in being
- Augustine: Divine sovereignty decree and providence reign absolutely while not acting as finite cause

**Influential Figures**
- Irenaeus: Emphasizes gentle dealing with the world, immanent creator
- Origen: Respects world's integrity, completion involving enfleshed Logos
- Gregory of Nyssa: God permeating creation, holding it in being
- Augustine: Divine sovereignty decree and providence reign absolutely while not acting as finite cause
- Albert the Great: Combines Aristotle (external cause) with Neoplatonism (ultimate form), God as source of all material causes, goal of all action, first cause of all agents, and source of all forms.

**God's Role in Hebrew Scriptures: Double Agency Perspective (continued)**
- Particular events are work of primary (God) and secondary (natural) agency together.


#### God's Double Agency in Theology: Divine Action and Mimetic Theory

**Divine Action: Double Agency Model**

**Aquinas' Perspective**:
- God can act apart from the world's normal order
- "detrahere actiones proprias robus est divinae bonitati derogare" (to deprive things of actions of their own is to belittle God's goodness)

**Etienne Gilson's Interpretation**:
- Viewed as a profoundly Christian insight based on God's great love for creation, rather than a rationalistic product
- Emphasizes the importance of safeguarding the rights of creatures to uphold the rights of God

**Divine Action according to Theo-drama Model**:
- Involves "uniform" divine action, where God underpins all of creation as the ground of being
- Becomes perceived as "special" divine action when specific circumstances or human actions allow for heightened transparency to divine communication

**Rowan Williams' Perspective**:
- Compares the created order to a texture of uneven thickness
- Divine action is only perceptible when the ego renounces or displaces itself
- God does not intervene in finite agency but works through it

**Girard's Insight and Theo-drama**:
- God and human beings can work in the same world without rivalry or envy
- Mimetic connection between persons, and with God through Jesus, is incompatible with the notion of dual agencies working independently
- Desire derives from each other's desires, leading to authentic personhood drawn from God

**Balthasar's Perspective**:
- Compares this process to the Stanislavsky or "method acting" school, where actors access emotion through a model
- In freedom, we respond to our divine model and find that we are increasingly blessed with authentic personhood

**God's Relationship with Humans**:
- Not envious and does not compete with human beings for desire
- Expropriates humans to personalize them for the sake of the whole
- Humans become free in themselves by being expropriated for God's purposes

**Girard's Compatibility with Theo-drama**:
- Regrettably, Balthasar and Milbank do not fully appreciate their compatibility on this point.


#### Mimetic desire and divine intervention in human freedom: God's non-rivalrous presence in literature and religion.

**Divine-Human Drama and Mimetic Desire**

**The Nature of God and Human Freedom**
- God honors human mimetic nature by shaping desires towards Jesus Christ
- God is not an intrusive claimant on human freedom, but a life-transforming presence
- The Holy God does not demand our space or attack through power, but works patiently within constraints

**Mimetic Desire and Rivalry**
- Mimetic desire can lead to rivalry and mutual self-definition instead of freedom
- Metaphysical desire is freed from escalation when it shares in God's non-competitive desire

**God's Interaction with Human Condition**
- The non-rivalrous God can get through to us despite our mimetic entrapment
- Divine providence uses negative experiences for liberation and conversion
- Rivalry can lead to positive outcomes, such as saintly models or self-awareness

**Jacob's Story: A Conversion from Rivalry**
- Jacob wrestles with the angel of God during a time of rivalry with Esau
- Receives new name (Israel) and vocation, averted potential violent conflict
- Limp as a reminder of his tendency towards rivalrous violence but also mercy from God

**God's Communication through Human Systems**
- Word of God comes to us through an evolving human system of communication
- Mimetic participation and hermeneutical character of revelation

**The Compatibility of Divine Revelation with Anthropological Method**
- Mimetic theory posits that anthropological insight comes from a supernatural source
- Revelation takes on human form for understanding according to recipient's mode.


### 6. The Shadow Side of Finitude

**The Shadow Side of Finitude**

**Girard's Theological Approach**:
- Acknowledges the enormous suffering and fall into rivalry and sacrifice that separate the "savage innocence" of animal mimesis from mimetic violence in emergent humanity
- Vests this acknowledgment in a sense of divine providence and eschatological hope, rather than Edenic escapism or balancing tragedy with aesthetically satisfying flourishes

**Objections to Girard's Vision**:
- Hans Urs von Balthasar and John Milbank disagree on how to read the Logos of Heraclitus, with Balthasar more attuned to its mythological dissimulation of human culture's founding violence
- Milbank cannot abide such agonistics, accusing Girard of immersing being itself in violence

**Girard and Evolution**:
- Girard views Charles Darwin's intellectual achievement as a model, extending its scope to hominization via the scapegoat mechanism
- This is seen as an evolutionary breakthrough that unlocks further evolutionary developments in socialization, brain, and language

**Interpreting Theological Implications**:
- Mainstream theologians see evolution as the means of God's ongoing creation through natural processes
- Some theologians question God's involvement in the dark and violent process of evolution
- Others refuse to identify God with the harsh and wasteful process, viewing it as contrary to what they see in Jesus Christ

**The Fallen Angels Theological Solution**:
- Blaming "the fall" on angels or humans is not good theology and not compatible with science
- This solution does not provide a sound theodicy or stimulus for animal welfare

**Mimetic Theory and Theological Concerns**:
- Identifying "the fall" as ruining a kinder, gentler version of life is inconceivable apart from natural selection and the consequences of finitude
- Adaptation and refinement under evolutionary pressure typically proceed only far enough to ensure reproductive success in a particular niche


#### Evolution's cooperative and conflictual aspects: humans, mimetic dynamics, and complex systems.

**Evolution Theory: Cooperation vs. Competition**

**Cooperation and Evolution:**
- Complex life forms emerged through cooperation as well as competition
- Natural cycles optimize life by balancing simpler and more complex species
- Re-wilding movement aims to revitalize ecosystems with apex predators
- Cooperation and conflict are interdependent

**Competition in Evolution:**
- Competition necessary for innovation, prosperity, and conflict resolution
- Mimesis fosters competition but also reinforces reciprocity
- Both cooperation and competition integral to being mimetic

**Girard's Perspective on Evolution:**
- Violence is a byproduct of mimetic rivalry, not foundational
- Human imitators become models for each other in the desire for objects
- Feedback process leads to irritating obstacles and forceful removal of obstacles, resulting in violence.

**Mimetic Dynamics:**
- All feedback loops in complex social life ultimately draw on mimetic reinforcement.
- Cooperation and competition are not polar opposites but interdependent.

**Evolution: A Complex Process:**
- Both cooperation and competition shape the evolution of life
- Accidental and predatory deaths represent a gift of life as much as destruction.


#### Exploring tragedy and finitude: divine love, sacrificial machine, and mimetic desire.

**The Tragic View of Life: Sacrifice and Creativity**

**Rolston's Perspective**:
- The view is not Panglossian, but a tragic one
- Tragedy arises from the shadow of prolific creativity in nature and life
- Divine mystery of sacrifice in nature recapitulated on the cross

**Girard's Ideas**:
- Darwin resorted to Thomas Malthus for population growth limitation
- Natural selection represents nature as a super-sacrificial machine
- Fragility and conflict cannot be exorcised from creation

**Understanding Divine Providence**:
- God creates material realities striving for perfection according to their natures
- Limitation is necessary for existence, despite freedom and potential rivalry/violence

**Human History as Tragedy**:
- Success in life is not guaranteed due to creaturely finitude
- Natural and human history can be understood through the lens of tragedy

**Mimetic Desire and Redirection**:
- Mimetic proneness to rivalry and violence must be addressed through learned desire redirection
- Insights from science fiction on artificial life-forms developing peacefulness

**Exploring Human Distinctiveness**:
- Science fiction provides a vehicle for exploring complexities of human distinctiveness
- Artificial agents must develop humanity by learning from relationships and experiences

**The Shadow Side of Finitude**:
- Finitude is the way the world is, not a flaw or ailment
- Tragic environment need not be attributed to wicked cosmos but divine love's structure


#### Exploring redemption and tragedy through René Girard's perspective on finitude, acceptance, and rival responses.

**Girard's Perspective on Finitude and Redemption**

**The Experience of Horror and Finitude:**
- Violence represents an ontological assault, described as "horror" (Cavarero)
- Sudden end to meaning-making activities without regard for individuals (Adams)
- Finitude not inherently evil, but requires redemption (Girard)

**The Role of Natural Selection:**
- Part of a process that builds and extends life (Girard)
- Savagery need not be described as natural evil

**Girard's View on Evolution and Divine Investment:**
- Affirms appreciation for biological complexity in evolution (Girard)
- Evolutionary theory based on chance alone cannot do justice to emergence (Girard)
- One victim is raised up to set a new direction, displacing survival of the fittest (Theo-drama)

**Rival Responses to Horrors of Life:**

**Accepting**:
- Posture of positivists and materialists
- Describing without lament
- Exultant version: celebrating tragic and Nietzsche's Übermensch (Nietzsche)
- Alternative version: resigned and despondent, revealing underlying psychological reality of traumatic events (La Capra)

**Blocking**:
- Attempts to re-narrate absence and loss
- Inability to advance beyond accepting or blocking (Farley)

**The Need for a Third Way:**
- Overaccepting as a fruitful category linking mimetic theory and dramatic theology
- Exploring this third way further in following chapters.


#### Trauma, Absence, and Blocking in Religion and Psychology: René Girard's Perspective

**Absence and Trauma**

**Impossible Mourning**:
- Exaggerated form of accepting absence
- Resulting in defeatism or lashing out
- Manifestation of the "false sacred"

**Blocking Responses to Absence**:
- **Structural trauma**: Abiding sense of absence not caused by actual loss
- Resolved by fixating on a lost past and failed meta narrative
- Results in "acting out" instead of "working through" mourning

**Examples of Blocking**:
- Belief in fallen angels: Attributing natural evils to supernatural agents
- Creation science: Refusing the testimony of science in favor of ideology
- Blaming God for violence and sacrifice

**Girard's Perspective**:
- Sense of "structural trauma" points to concrete events of natural history and prehistory
- Real foundational events, not confabulations, perpetuate the tragic quality of finitude


#### Exploring redemption and re-narrating tragedy in Christian thought: Augustine, Darwin, and Girard.

**Girard vs. La Capra: Dealing with Absence and Trauma**

**Girard's Perspective:**
- Advocates redemption in the face of loss and absence
- Believes there is a deeper order working itself out
- Resources for facing sense of absence without recourse to mythology or passivity
- Focuses on recognizing violent reality behind myths
- Avoiding mimetic entrapment: just get on with things
- Withdrawal from mimetic fascination, not withdrawal tout court

**La Capra's Perspective:**
- Addresses the gnawing sense of absence in modern Western life
- Advocates a theology of divine action in kenosis
- Recovering affective memory for dealing with absence
- Disagrees with Girard on withdrawal and passive response to loss

**Comparative Analysis:**
- Both authors recognize importance of facing absence and trauma
- Differences lie in their proposed solutions: redemption vs. kenosis, withdrawal vs. active engagement
- Girard's focus on redemption encourages proactive change, while La Capra's theology provides resources for dealing with absence without giving up on the world.

**Augustine and Re-Narrating:**
- Augustine offers a re-narrating of evil within the context of divine providence
- Balances horrors of immanent disorder according to a grander whole
- Prioritizes systemic view of measure in creation, making individual suffering less central
- Darwin's deistic perspective: denying divine involvement in natural laws
- Natural evils not blamed on God as part of theodicy.


#### Discussing theological interpretations of natural selection, violence, and redemption.

**Natural Selection and God's Role in Suffering**
- **Darwin's Unique Solution**: Natural selection operating without divine intervention was Darwin's response to creaturely maladaptation and suffering.
- **Rejecting Blame**: Neither God nor Adam and Eve are responsible for the extent of creaturely maladaptation and suffering; it is just "how things are."
- **God's Role in Redemption**: The God of Jesus Christ provides the only theodicy suitable for Christians, as He redeems the horrors rather than theorizing them away.
- **Girard's Interpretation of Job**: Job was unjustly scapegoated by his friends who encouraged him to take blame for his misfortunes. The real God appears in Job's protest, not the false god representing the status quo.

**Milbank's Critique and Alternative Narratives**
- **Milbank's Influential Critique**: Attempts to "out-narrate" versions of reality that make peace with violence and tragedy by proposing a healthily differentiated world order rooted in transcendent being.
- **Univocity vs. Equivocity**: If we insist on a univocal ontology, there can be no real otherness or basis for hierarchy, leading to competition among "equals."
- **Milbank's View on Darwinian Science and Dinosaurs**: Rejecting the idea of evolution as an unacceptable mythology, Milbank insists that the fall from original creation is irreversible. Dinosaur fossils are seen as monstrous beings that do not belong to the primarily intended created order.
- **Girard vs. Milbank on Theological Narratives**: While Girard holds for a robust scientific and social-scientific inquiry, Milbank seeks to out-narrate secular modernity with a more realistic, pacific narrative grounded in faith and gospel.


#### A critique of Milbank's theological narrative: Violence and re-narrating in Christian thought

**The Debate between Milbank and Girard on Truth and Narrative**

**Milbank's Critique of Girard**:
- Milbank criticizes Girard's account as prescriptive, when it is meant to be descriptive
- Milbank accuses Girard of harboring a violent ontology, but this is ironic given Milbank's own program

**Critiques of Milbank's Narrative**:
- Gavin Hyman questions whether Milbank's narrative of peace respects difference and does not obliterate it
- Scott MacDougall contends that Milbank's radical disjoining of Augustine's two cities demonstrates the violence he claims to deplore
- MacDougall also criticizes Milbank's Edenic backward-lookingness at the expense of a Christian eschatological perspective

**Girard vs. Milbank on Secular Modernity**:
- Girard and Milbank agree that secular modernity is accompanied by the return of the Dionysian, but account for it differently
- Girard sees the secular as God's doing, while Milbank views it as the dis-tasteful way our world appears to the metaphysically misinformed
- Girard is more positive about the secular, seeing it as the world shaking off the false sacred through the cultural diffusion of gospel influence

**Girard's Perspective on Re-narrating**:
- Girard sees Jesus's cross as effecting a transfiguration in which the Holy Spirit carries a broken world into the embrace of resurrection
- There is no enmity toward this world and no one-upmanship from the one who gave his life to free this world from rivalry and violence
- Girard draws near to the theology of kenosis, where Jesus's uniqueness means what it does not mean

**Girard vs. Milbank on Logos**:
- Girard sees Christianity as inhabiting the carapace of false-sacred religiousness, leaving place for law, self-sacrifice, and mythology
- This is different from Milbank's emphasis on continuity and completion via correction


### 7. Divine Overaccepting

**Overaccepting in Improvisation and Theology:**

**Background:**
- Thomas R. Yoder Neufeld's perspective on divine sovereignty and human response to tragic circumstances
- Discussion of overaccepting as an improvement over accepting or blocking in improvisational theater

**Concept of Overaccepting:**
1. Definition: practicing acceptance of unexpected developments with skill and creativity, crafting a coherent outcome
2. Advancement on accepting (knocks drama off course) and blocking (wastes opportunities):
   - Maintains inner logic of the drama
   - Achieves satisfying outcome for audience
3. Richard Egarr's example: incorporating mobile phone ringtone into performance
4. Samuel Wells' perspective: overaccepting as an ecclesiastical practice and definition of Theo-drama (divine-human drama) as given, everything else is gift.
5. Jesus as a great exponent of overaccepting in the context of Theo-drama.

**Implications for Theology:**
- Divine sovereignty does not hinder human response and creativity within the divine-human drama
- Overaccepting represents an improvement by embracing unexpected developments with skill and creativity, leading to a coherent outcome.


#### Exploring overaccepting in theology: Jesus, doctrine, redemption, and creation.

**Overaccepting as a Spiritual Approach:**

**Matthew and Luke's Temptations of Jesus**:
- Jesus neither accepts nor blocks temptations, but over-accepts by adopting them on his own terms for the service of God's reign.

**The Concept of Overaccepting in Christian Orthodoxy**:
- Tradition is the "Divine Overaccepting" of tension between 'sameness' and 'difference'.
- It aims at a kind of nonidentical repetition that ensures the reintroduction of lost elements ripe for reincorporation.

**Redemption and Eschatology**:
- Tragedy can be turned into gift through overaccepting.
- Overaccepting requires neither tragic resignation nor triumphal declaration, but a fully penitential approach to human finitude and sinfulness.

**Overaccepting Mimetic Nature**:
- We neither accept the negative potential of our mimetic nature nor block it with self-hatred.
- Overaccepting allows us to be caught up in the desires of Christ and his saints.

**Girard's Assessment of Secular Modernity**:
- Girard's overaccepting regards secular modernity as a consequence of the gospel, while also acknowledging the losses it entails.

**Augustine vs. Irenaeus**:
- Augustine's model of creation and evil is criticized for its negative divine response to disruptions, similar to blocking.
- Irenaeus offers a more open process where the fall is seen as an advance in the ongoing creation of humankind.


#### Exploring Girard's perspective on divine overacceptance and redemption of natural suffering in light of creation and evolution.

**Theological Perspective: Overaccepting vs. Accepting**

**Background:**
- Irenaeus' perspective on suffering and creation: more eschatologically oriented, compatible with evolutionary process
- Girard's use of Paul's concept of katéchon in accounting for human sin and natural suffering

**Girard's View:**
- Evolution seen spiritually as a divinely underwritten process revealing divine purpose
- Divine Providence: redemption via overaccepting in terms of the overall Theo-drama
- Human life requires tragedy and suffering for spiritual growth

**Theological Problem of Suffering:**
- Hick's conclusion: free persons cannot learn spiritually through conflict, suffering, and redemption if already ready made
- Girard's response: suffering yields to overaccepting by joining it to that of Christ

**Approaches to Interpreting Creation:**
- Augustine (accepting): focus on redemption from sin
- Irenaeus (overaccepting): focus on the fulfillment of creation

**Theological Figures:**
- Irenaeus: eschatologically oriented perspective, emphasis on divine purpose in evolutionary process
- Alexander of Hales, Duns Scotus, Bonaventure: medieval cosmic Christology, incarnation and creation integral
- Karl Rahner: self-transcending impetus in evolutionary change
- Ilia Delio: fulfillment of creation focus, risen Christ as inner power of the evolving universe

**Girard's Thoughts:**
- Christ recapitulating all sacrifices
- False sacred progressively recolonized and overtaken by new, secularizing Gospel version
- Creation's purpose emerging out of méconnaissance thanks to Judeo-Christian revelation.


#### Augustine's City of God: Overaccepting Realpolitik and Violence in Religion and Politics

**The City of God and Creation in Genesis: Overaccepting Realpolitik**

**Augustine's Two Cities**:
- The city of God contributes to the good of the earthly city
- The earthly city serves the city of God by exercising its disciplinary rights over human disorder
- Human sin and violence exist in both cities, but are ameliorated by the city of God

**Girard's Approach**:
- A more purist and rigorist approach can betray the cause of justice and Christian fidelity
- Girard's non-pacifist admission that limited, lawful violence is needed to restrain worse violence represents an Augustinian insight

**The Comic Trumps the Tragic**:
- The comic performance in Ariadne auf Naxos interrupts the tragic and cheers the heroine
- Woody Allen's films mock the gloomy fatalism of Russian literature and cinema, classical tragedy, and Ingmar Bergman
- The comic shares a depth of realism with the tragic, but is more hopeful and eschatologically attuned

**Overaccepting in Christian Practice**:
- The church is not a separate institution, but works with other actors to divert tragedy into the drama of redemption
- Under General Augusto Pinochet's Chilean dictatorship, the church confronted the official practice of torture by conflating it with a counter-liturgy

**Genesis 1-3 as a Political Theology**:
- The accounts of creation in Genesis 1–3 are best understood as a political theology of overaccepting in allegorical form
- Genesis registers a protest against Babylonian cosmology and the export of its religio-political agenda by repurposing it


#### Exploring divine overacceptance through trauma, compassion, and pastoral ministry.

**Genesis Creation Accounts: Overaccepting**

**Insight from Psalms:**
- Leviathan formed for sport in deep (Genesis)
- Peaceful creation, not violent chaos
- Eve recognized as Adam's bone and flesh (Genesis 2:22-23)
- No foundational rivalry or crisis of undifferentiation

**Creation Accounts Differences:**
- Orderly progression over six days
- Different from Babylonian myth: world created in peace

**Divine Overaccepting:**
- Transcends violence and dualism
- Providence revealed through suffering and trauma
- Human collaboration essential to divine purposes

**Compassion:**
- Intensity of divine being entering into suffering
- Mediation works mimetically (Christ's compassionate desire)
- Healing for the traumatized: speak, be heard, reintegrate story

**Psalms and Pastoral Ministry:**
- Provide way to transfigure trauma experience
- Offer hope and faith when confronted with reality
- Sacramental revelation of divine mystery at heart of pastoral church.

**Trauma and Overaccepting:**
- God "gets it" (Jones)
- Traumatized need chance to speak, be heard, have story reintegrated into normal functioning
- Holy Spirit as advocate for defense of victims.

**Calvin on Psalms:**
- Gives language to the traumatized
- Mimicking psalmist's words aids in overaccepting suffering (Jones)
- First historical instance of sacrificial victims protesting innocence, power of false sacred beginning to lose its power.

**Girardian Overtones:**
- Calvin's teachings on the psalms suggest Girardian overaccepting
- Psalmist becomes mimetic model for healing desire.


#### Exploring Girardian Theology: Overaccepting Divine Scandal and Violence.

**The Overaccepting Nature of the Secular as a Fruit of the Gospel**

**Background:**
- Sense of trauma rooted in past but unable to be specific (structural trauma)
- False sacred losing its monopoly leading to revelation through Judeo-Christian scriptures

**Nietzsche and Girard's Perspectives:**
- Nietzsche: festivals of atonement needed for restoring what has been lost
- Girard: secularity as the gospel overaccepted, representing "death of God"

**Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World:**
- Scandal of divine grace and justice: undeserving receive blessings while deserving suffer
- Problematic themes for modern Westerners: God's apparent sanctioning of suffering and violence, scriptural themes of divine wrath, apocalypse, and judgment

**The Force of Love: Overaccepting the Scandal – Wrath, Apocalypse, Judgment**

**Scandal as Obstacle:**
- Jesus' willingness to accept cross denies expected role from false sacred
- Disciples' disappointment with Jesus due to inability to imagine something beyond conventional moral reckoning

**Scandalized Mindset and Revelation:**
- Girardian thinker Jeremiah Alberg: scandal of God's mercy awakens jealousy and rivalry, forcing us to see ourselves and God in a new way
- Acknowledging sinfulness as part of the process of being liberated from it

**Examples of Scandalized Mindsets:**
- Jean-Jacques Rousseau: expels gospel from system to preserve sense of natural goodness, creating rivalry against Christianity
- Flannery O'Connor: orthodox Christianity's eschatological hope serves children better than self-righteous tenderness toward their suffering

**Conclusion:**
- Scandalized mindset creates "in group" of non-exploiters who are outraged by an obviously morally culpable God, but O'Connor believes that this tendency may willingly see Christ sacrificed.


#### Exploring Divine Overaccepting and Nonviolent Love in Religion and Literature

**Divine Overaccepting and Violence**

**O'Connor's Perspective**:
- God allows innocents to perish while Jesus survives, allowing redemption for all lost
- O'Connor's interpretation of Matthew 11:12: the kingdom of God is taken by force, not through human violence but through the power of faith and submission to truth

**Girard's Perspective**:
- Divine violence can be wrestled with and yield a blessing through mimetic theory
- Apocalypse is seen as a testament to God's nonviolent force of love, not as divine punishment or human violence
- Revelation delivers the apocalyptic texts into modern human hands for judgment and liberation

**Forgiveness and Judgment**:
- Forgiveness holds the possibility of breaking the chain of violence, but must be based on full knowledge of the nature of the violation
- God's judgment is not inflicted upon us but manifests in our own self-awareness and transformation through grace
- Divine wrath appears only from a distorted perspective; God judges us by raising us from the dead

**Key Insights**:
- Divine overaccepting refers to God's ability to transform suffering and judgment into redemption and liberation
- Human response should involve submission to truth, rather than attempting mastery or refusal to see the reality of violence
- The apocalypse is a manifestation of God's nonviolent force of love, revealed through revelation and human experience.


#### Divine love and nonviolence: Overcoming judgment and hell through Girard's overaccepting perspective

**The Three Servants' Perception of the Master**
- The third servant perceives the master differently from the first two servants
- This "unworthy" servant believes the master to be harsh and reacts fearfully to expectations
- This leads to a mimetic fascination and confirmation of his self-chosen destiny

**Divine Forgiveness and Transformation**
- Divine forgiveness is not just pardon, but transformation of our image of God
- God's love and grace are revealed through this process
- Sinners must choose to accept the truth or continue in self-delusion
- Hell represents a personal identity and social context that may be clung to, despite God's offer of salvation

**God's Nonviolent Love**
- God is like a loving father who meets sinners with anticipatory love
- The judgment sayings are not a sign of a dual nature in God, but bring out human inability to save themselves
- Hell and judgment are part of the process of being freed from destructive illusions
- Heaven represents God's overaccepting of humanity's history of sin and violence

**Divine Overaccepting and Nonviolence**
- Divine violence can be transfigured through overaccepting, not blocking
- This "nonviolent violence" is entailed by the resurrection and present in the Christian community
- The peaceful church mediates God's "terror" against evil through love and faithfulness

**Controversy: Volf's View on Christian Pacifism**
- Miroslav Volf believes a wrathful God is necessary for nonviolence in politics
- Volf's solution may be inadequate to address historical tyrants and madmen
- Girard's version of overaccepting leads to a different conclusion, acknowledging human participation in God's nonviolence


### 8. Christ the Nonviolence of God

**Girard's Understanding of Sacrifice: Continuities and Discontinuities**

**Background:**
- René Girard's perspective on sacrifice as a transformative category in human religious history
- The Passion unveiling the sacrificial origin of humanity
- Christian revelation confirming all religions in their relation to the divine

**Continuities:**
1. Jesus's passion connected to every sacred ritual
2. Pagan resurrections as templates for Jesus’s resurrection
3. Sacrifice maintains a symbolic role in human religious history
4. Changes in meaning of sacrifice contain a history of mankind
5. Archaic sacred seen as a first path toward God
6. Importance of prohibitions and restraints to avoid rivalrous mimetic escalation
7. God allowing Satan to reign for a season before Christ overcomes him on the cross
8. Necessity of acknowledging both break and continuity between archaic religions and biblical revelation

**Discontinuities:**
1. The death of Jesus was not sought or willed by God
2. Jesus's death was inevitable, but not intended by God
3. Golgotha reflects God’s circumstantial will for Jesus in a world that resists his saving presence
4. Christian revelation dispels but does not authorize us to condemn sacrifice as if we were strangers to violence.


#### Exploring Girard's perspective on God, religion, and sacrificial violence in human history

**Girard's Perspective on God and Religion**

**Two Modes of Divinity**:
- Distinction between the religion of God and the religion of "man"
- Incarnation of Jesus meant to displace religions reliant on old sacrificial mechanism

**The Nature of Divine Grace**:
- Only special grace from God could have bridged chasm between human violence and divine intervention
- Gospels bear intelligence beyond human comprehension, revealing a non-violent God's willingness to become a victim

**Jesus as Renunciation of Violence**:
- Divine annexation of human sacrificial mechanism through Jesus' death
- Old sacrificial mechanism works, but on its own terms, yielding peace through Jesus' non-violent act

**Overaccepting Mimetic Theory**:
- Girard acknowledges God's investment in human religion, even though it will be taken up and annexed by the divine
- Tension between God's conditional investment and eventual repurposing of human mechanisms
- Human sacrifice offers to God, but with recognition of Jesus as God's own self-sacrificial act

**High Christology**:
- Girard derives high dogmatic claims for Christ from scientific conclusions, practicing overaccepting mimetic theory.


#### René Girard's unique perspective on Jesus' divinity and Christianity's role in revealing sacred violence.

**Girard's Theological Position: Mimetic Theory and Christology**

**Girard's Dogmatic Theological Positions**
- Jesus's resurrection represents the entrance of a greater power than violence in history
- Virgin birth exonerates Jesus of complicity in mythical divine births and sacred violence
- Jesus is the Son of God from eternity, as proclaimed by New Testament and Fathers
- Divinity of Christ is the only hypothesis to account for the revelation in Gospel

**Jesus's Divinity as Hypothesis**
- Jesus cannot have emerged from a world dominated by violence knowing its true nature
- Only logical conclusion: Jesus was not an ordinary human being but God incarnate
- Christological belief is the over-accepting of anthropology

**Christian Uniqueness and Other Religions**
- No comparable level of insight into foundational role of violence outside Judeo-Christian scriptures
- Limited presence of insight in Greek tragedy, Eastern religions, Buddhism, Islam
- Christianity has been more effective in deconstructing sacred violence than other religions
- Divine grace present whether or not it is recognized as such
- Jesus's uniqueness must be held onto, rather than assimilating Christianity to mythology.

**Girard's Message: No Superiority for Christianity**
- No warrant for Christianity or the church to feel superior despite centrality of Jesus
- Focus on good news for new way of being human in the world, not self-promotion.


#### Girard's perspective: Christianity and Judaism's interconnected roles in revelation and nonviolence.

**Girard's Perspective on Christian Uniqueness and Judaism:**

**Christian Uniqueness**:
- Not a matter of particular revelation apart from that revelation fully inhabiting public history
- Upheld but turned outward, not exclusive but anthropologically accessible
- Inclusive, forgiving, world-transforming love of God guaranteed by the Christian proclamation of Jesus's uniqueness

**Old Testament and Judaism**:
- A long and laborious exodus out of the world of violence and sacred projections
- Waits for the advent of Jesus Christ for completion of revelation
- Gospels make universal what was already there in the Old Testament
- Overaccepting Judaism: honoring it and viewing Christianity as a praeparatio messianica, joining Israel in looking for the final messianic consummation

**Girard's Interpretation**:
- Shift from Old Testament to New Testament represents a decisive break yet continuity
- Old Testament exposes and undermines false-sacred mythology
- Jesus Christ completes revelation by concrete demonstration
- Dissident minority that sees things in a new way is not always named in the Old Testament

**Relationship Between Christianity and Judaism**:
- Both peoples of the God of Israel
- Pinchas Lapide, a Jewish theologian, believes in the resurrection of Jesus in continuity with Pharisees' belief in eternal life.


#### A dialogue between René Girard and his student on the relationship between Judaism and Christianity, and the distinctiveness of Christian revelation.

**René Girard and the Nonviolent God: Dialogue on Jesus's Distinctiveness between Judaism and Christianity**

**Background:**
- Lapide's perspective: resurrection as a gift of hope from Israel's covenant to Gentiles, but not convinced of Jesus being the Christ or divine
- Goodhart's dialogue with Girard on this question

**Girard's Viewpoint:**
- Central anti-idolatry theme in Hebrew scripture benefits from fuller exposure through the passion narratives of Jesus
- Superior revelatory force due to practical didactics in exposing false sacred
- Christian texts reveal sacrificial mechanism and confirmatory role of Jesus's resurrection

**Goodhart's Response:**
- Distinctive role for Christian texts in exposing the scapegoat victimage mechanism
- Jesus's revelation rooted in continuity with Torah
- Christianity as a reading of Judaism for Hellenized Jewish audience, then to wider non-Jewish world
- Sole word of God for Jews is Torah

**Girard and Goodhart Debate:**
- Solidarity between God and victimized scapegoats in Hebrew scripture
- Christianity's depth goes beyond Judaism through fully recapitulating archaic sacred
- Christian theology takes Jewish achievement to new levels, not rejecting it
- Possibility of a mimetic reversal of anti-Semitism if Israel insists too strongly on its distinctiveness

**Mark Anspach's Perspective:**
- Jewish-Christian rivalry as internal mediation, with each serving as model and obstacle to the other in terms of unique revelation

**Conclusion:**
- Jesus took embodied history to a new place through his bodily resurrection
- Christianity's dogmatic edifice built upon the resurrection took the religion of Torah to a new and unanticipated place
- Avoiding supersessionism and triumphalism by recognizing mutual interdependence between Judaism and Christianity.


#### Exploring Christian Atonement Theories: Redemptive Violence and Mimetic Reconciliation

**Theological Perspectives on Atonement**

**Tom Wright's View:**
- Covenant-keeping God takes full force of sin onto himself
- No wrathful God demanding blood or satisfaction

**Peter Schmiechen:**
- Natural to acknowledge those who died for us as soldiers, unnatural to refer to them as giving their lives to the enemy

**Theological Complexity and Controversy:**
- Various atonement theories coexist in Christianity
- Some views seen as culturally echoing violent beliefs
- Effects include justification of colonial excesses, retributive justice, patriarchal social inequalities, and American civil religion of redemptive violence

**Girard's Perspective:**
- Reveals theological roots of structural violence through mimetic theory
- God must be delivered from false sacred by humanity, not Jesus' torture and death

**Atonement Theories:**
1. **Classic Theory (Christus Victor Model):**
   - God in Christ overcomes Satan, freeing enslaved humanity
2. **Latin Theory (Anselmian View):**
   - Christ provides human satisfaction to God, leading to divine largesse
3. **Subjective View or Moral Influence Theory:**
   - Emphasizes the impact of Christ's love on believers' hearts, leading to repentance and conversion

**Girardian Resonances in Aulén's Typology:**
- Classical Theory: God overcomes Satan, freeing humanity
- Latin Theory: Christ provides human satisfaction to God, leading to divine grace
- Subjective View or Moral Influence Theory: Impact of Christ's love on believers' hearts

**Debate among Theologians:**
- Some argue these approaches compromise the Christian message by peacefully accepting sacrificial violence.


#### Exploring the nonviolent nature of God in atonement theories: Anselm, Abelard, and Girard.

**René Girard and Atonement Traditions:**

**Girard's Perspective**:
- Argues against discarding atonement traditions if they contribute to violence or non-freedom praxis
- Seeks to advance beyond theological mimetic doubles by understanding these traditions in depth

**Moral Influence Theory (Abelard)**:
- Focuses on transformation of lives rather than cosmic transaction
- Eschues necessity of Jesus's death for divine honor and restoration of creation order
- Highlights revelatory aspect of Jesus's cross
- Complements Girard's emphasis on revelation but falls short in exposing false sacred

**Satisfaction Theory (Anselm)**:
- God restores distorted created order through human sacrifice, which maintains divine love, mercy, and justice
- Satisfies Anselm's connection to feudal social arrangements as an integrated system of relationships
- Jesus's death fulfills God's expectations for humanity as a whole
- Divine justice emphasized but not retribution or personal offense towards individuals
- Non-rivalrous respect for creation and human agency comes into view.

**False Sacred in Atonement Traditions**:
- Violence has fed into and issued from satisfaction theory
- Importance of understanding these traditions in depth to overcome violent effects.


#### Exploring the problematic nature of penal substitutionary atonement in Western theology, from Anselm to modern Evangelicalism.

**The Evolution of Eucharistic Prayers and Theories in Western Theology: From Carolingian Era to Reformation**

**Carolingian Era:**
- Saxons educated using pagan-influenced themes
- Gallican Eucharistic prayer replaced by one emphasizing real presence of crucified Christ
- New emphasis on guilt and expiation entered Western theology with tortured Saxon crucifixes

**Anselm's Satisfaction Theory:**
- Emerged during Carolingian social order decline and Pope Urban II's call for military defense
- God's wrath against human sin replaced Anselm's respect for humanity
- Tension between divine wrath and mercy lost in favor of their pathological fusion (penal substitutionary atonement)

**Penal Substitutionary Atonement:**
- Default position in conservative Evangelicalism worldwide
- Criticized for perpetuating false sacred violence and punishment of the innocent
- Originated from Calvin's development, which fully weighted Jesus' sacrificial act with human redemption
- Distorted image of God as both divine and wrathful punisher
- Consequences: justification of modern violent practices, fanaticism, fascination with suffering

**Impact on Contemporary Culture:**
- Misconceptions of forgiveness and salvation
- Provides validating symbols for perpetrators of violence

**Criticisms of Penal Substitutionary Atonement:**
- Not biblical or consistent with Jesus' teachings (Peter Schmiechen, Stephen H. Travis)
- Lacks focus on Jesus' praxis and transformation of lives

**False Sacred Survivals in Western Theology:**
- Prevalence in Catholic liturgical, atonement, and spiritual theologies
- Objected by scholars like Robert Daly for perpetuating violent imagery
- Misconceptions fuel popular religious experiences, as seen in Mel Gibson's film 'The Passion of the Christ.'


#### Exploring nonviolent understanding of atonement and divine mercy in Christianity.

**The Atonement Theory: Divine Mercy vs. Human Reconciliation**

**Gratitude, Shame, and Atonement Theory**
- Gratitude tainted by guilt (121)
- Confession offers temporary relief (121)
- Repentance brings short-lived reform (121)
- Liturgy stimulates passing feeling of release (121)
- Mentality of shame underlying atonement theory (121)
- Atonement doctrine replaces actual sacrificial ritual but not its underlying fears (121)

**Reversing the Perspective on Pental Substitutionary Atonement**
- Divine mercy and divine violence are not one and the same (125)
- Humanity feels estranged from God, needing reconciliation (126)
- Sacrifice of Jesus as a sign of divine mercy enacted in human sacrifice (126)
- Divine mercy can only reach us through religious violence it seeks to overcome (126)

**Understanding Atonement: Sin Offering and God's Gift of Life**
- Jesus represents a sin offering, but not for making humanity righteous (122)
- Blood shed was about the gift of life, not necessity of death (123)
- Atonement primarily a human-directed activity of God (124)
- God propitiating us; we are the angry divinity in need of reconciliation (125, 128)

**Atonement as Given and Received State**
- Change of heart unlocks meaning of atonement (127)
- Christ's suffering defeats Satan, enabling change of heart (127)
- God's love for us not limited by our enmity (128)
- Divine disfavor sense set aside through reconciliation to God (129)

**Divine Maternal Love and Human Sinfulness**
- Divine maternal love instead of divine disfavor (129)
- Resentment leading to deliverance from psychic woundedness (130, 131)
- God carrying our han (woundedness) through Jesus's blood (131)

**Theodicy and Practical Outworking of Divine Absorption of Violence**
- God offering solidarity in love, breaking the cycle of violence (133, 135)
- Refusal to "take the bait" necessary for transforming difficult situations (136)
- Christ taking responsibility for world's evil and absorbing its consequences (137)
- God defeating Satan through subterfuge: short-circuiting violence (137)


#### Exploring the salvific defeat of Satan through Girard's perspective: Christus Victor renaissance and nonviolent resistance.

**Girard's Interpretation of Satan and Salvation:**
* **Satan's role**: Represents the mimetic, sacrificial complex humanity is trapped in
* **Revealed and overcome**: Not a cosmic victory but through understanding the anthropology of the Cross
* **Cross as neutralization**: Victim mechanism escapes control of Satan
* **Importance of Jesus's exposure of scapegoat mechanism**
* **Divine wisdom**: Neutralized victim mechanism, participation in God's plan unawares
* **Greek Fathers' perspective**: Satan caught in trap of own mystification
* **Ancient theories and modern interpretations:**
	+ Aulén's association with classic theory (Christus Victor)
	+ Augustine's defeat of evil by exposing its unfairness and immorality
	+ Girard's passive victim vs. Weaver's agitating savior
* **Images illustrating power through subversion**: Aikido, family systems theory
* **Heim's reflection on atonement**
* **Christus Victor renaissance**: Boersma's subordination of theories, superiority over medieval models.


#### René Girard's nonviolent interpretation of the cross and atonement in Christianity.

**Girard's Interpretation of the Cross: A Dialogue with Weaver and Ray**

**Background:**
- Girard offers an interpretation of the cross that addresses issues with traditional views on satisfaction and substitution
- Discussion focuses on nonviolent nature of Jesus's atonement
- Theo-dramatic quality to divine action and human response in atonement process

**Girard's Interpretation vs. Traditional Views:**
- Objective change with the cross: Girard offers a new perspective without repeating problems connected to traditional interpretations
- Divine action and human response: Dramatic quality of Christus Victor approach (Aulén) creates an opportunity for forgiveness once powers are subdued
- Modern necessity: Accommodate both temporal mediation and social context (Rupp)

**Social Constitution of Individual Selfhood:**
- Recovers a more porous individual than Western modernity perceives
- Enables possibility of global change while considering individual reception and outworking by grace

**The Holy Spirit's Role:**
- Carries impact of Easter into wider action to ensure victims are treated differently from the one called God's advocate for defense
- Overcoming mimetic control by crowd available to all who share in Jesus's praxis by grace

**Divine Act vs. Human Collaboration:**
- Divine act and human response: An eternal goodness cancels even evil but continues to court freedom through the Spirit (Schwager)
- God enables humanity to find a way beyond depredations of false-sacred violence

**Girard's Solution:**
- Overaccepting Jesus's sacrifice: Price of humanity being freed from méconnaisance and redemptive violence
- Reimagining atonement concepts: A way to talk about God rescuing humanity from power of structuring violence to discover transformed life in Jesus Christ

**Imaginative Field:**
- Traditional notion of God redeeming the world through death of Jesus reimagined as part of bigger picture
- Atonement concepts can inspire communities for vicarious sacrifice and making a difference in the world around us (Cahill)

**Overaccepting vs. Accepting/Blocking:**
- Escapes charges of downplaying Jesus's sacrifice or radicalism of his praxis
- Reveals humanity needs to be reconciled with God, not vice versa
- No other way for God to overcome our méconnaissance than letting Jesus undergo atonement process at our hands.


### Conclusion

**Conclusion: Theological Implications of René Girard's Mimetic Theory**

**Girard's Account of Humanity and Society**:
- Emerges through the homeopathic use of violence
- Reveals the God of Judeo-Christian revelation as an extra-systemic element that exposes and disempowers the structuring of society on violent foundations

**The Gospel as a Stumbling Block**:
- The gospel constitutes a stumbling block to the usual working of human religiousness
- But also a hopeful pointer beyond it for those who develop the "intelligence of the victim" and live differently
- This is the continuing work of Christ and the Holy Spirit

**Mimetic Theory in Three Phases**:
1. Early stages: 
   - Learns from great literature that desire is borrowed and derivative, leading to pathologies like envy and rivalry
   - Identifies this mimetic quality in Greek tragedies, which call into question the mythical dissimulation of this mechanism
2. Middle stages: 
   - Delineates the universal shape of this phenomenon through close reading of world mythology and ritual
   - Central theme: humanity emerging and growing on the back of this serendipitous discovery for keeping violence under control
3. Later stages:
   - Discovers a way beyond this state of affairs, disclosed in the Hebrew scriptures and Gospels' passion narratives
   - Christ is present not only in person but also incognito as the form of conversion

**Theological Implications**:
- Revelation is central, but inseparable from the process of being caught up in God's healing and liberating project
- Requires a comprehensive, dynamic, spiritual theology to do it justice
- Compatible with theological dramatic theory, which links revelation and salvation
- Providence works kenotically, incarnationally through natural processes out of love for the world and respect for creatures
