# Spiral Dynamics In Action Practical Application Of Spiral Don Edward Beck (2018)

> **A more effective leadership model for the new business environment.**\
> Spiral Dynamics in Action explores the evolution of modern business, and provides a model for moving forward amidst ever-increasing complexity and change. Only by truly understanding other people's perspectives can you bring them together to achieve the extraordinary, and this book provides a field guide to the different motivations, behaviours and talents in your team to help you lead diverse groups more effectively. Focused on action over theory, the Spiral Dynamics model includes cutting-edge leadership practices, management systems, processes, procedures and techniques to help you bring about real-world results.\
> The nature of change is consistent, but that doesn't make it any less enormous or complex to deal with. As a business leader, you are tasked with not only navigating change yourself, but also guiding others through the maze successfully. This book shows you how to shift your perspective, hone your focus and deliver what your people need by: 
> - Understanding the reasoning behind different perspectives.
> - Helping people play off one another's strengths to achieve a shared goal.
> - Adopting cutting-edge practices, processes and procedures for improvement.
> - Taking action to re-connect an increasingly fragmented environment. \
> The marketplace has gone truly global, workforces are increasingly diverse and companies are taking on powerful new social responsibilities. It's a lot to take in, let alone manage, but the responsibility of leadership is to gather disparate parts and make them into a whole. It's your job to turn anchors into rocket fuel, and motivate and inspire your team to the top. By digging to the core of each person, each culture and each problem, you uncover a roadmap to high performance; Spiral Dynamics in Action shows you how to guide your people through any changes and emerge stronger than before. - [Spiral Dynamics in Action_Practical Application of Spiral_Don Edward Beck](https://www.amazon.com/Spiral-Dynamics-Action-Humanitys-Master/dp/1119387183?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

## Foreword

**Foreword by Ronnie Lessem**

**Introduction**:
- Spiral Dynamics is a major, systemic way of thinking about everything that addresses the "big picture"
- Holistic perspectives provide a mechanism and methodology for looking at macro and micro issues simultaneously
- These perspectives align and connect all variables: stakeholders, cultures, sub-cultures, and other interests within an elegant design

**Spiral Dynamics**:
- Integrates technology, business systems, and human dynamics within a seamless, interactive process
- Unique among applied literature, journals, bestseller books, academic programs, or consultant packages
- Emerged from meeting Don Beck in South Africa during the country's transition

**Crossing Frontiers**:
- Spiral Dynamics crosses all frontiers from east to west, north to south
- Contrasts with the "West" (primarily America) leading and the rest following
- Provides an alternative to the assumption that one size fits all

**Conclusion**:
- The authors of this book showed that it can be otherwise - individual, organization, and society can align simultaneously.


## Preface

**The Complexity of the 21st Century**

**Questions**:
- Why can't Israel and its neighbors make peace?
- Why do some African countries continue to have brutal political regimes that destroy their economies, kill their own people, and rape their women?
- Why is America so polarized that collegial debate on issues now seems like a faint memory of an earlier age?
- When did America and its close allies in Northern Europe begin thinking differently on global issues?
- And why did this happen?

**Answer**: The answers lie not in the surface symptoms, but in the underlying causes. We live in a complex, peculiar, and dangerous world with more than 6 billion humans of different world views connected by migration, air travel, and the internet. Most believe their view is right, their values are right, and we must understand this to address human dilemmas.

**Human Emergence and Regeneration**:
- The author has been on a quest for 40 years to understand the **Universal Master Code** that explains how humans have emerged and how they can continue to evolve positively.
- **Dr. Clare Graves**' research showed that human emergence is an ever-ending process, not an event. We are always becoming more than we were and not yet what we will be.
- Graves identified 8 levels of human emergence, with the future lying in a 9th level (Second-Tier system) that accommodates all previous levels through healthy conduits for movement.

**Current Transformation**:
- We are now passing through a major turning point, a history-making change. A new pattern of thought is beginning to emerge worldwide and in various fields of human activity.
- Understanding humanity's Master Code will not only solve today's challenges but take us further, faster, with less conflict than we thought possible. We must understand this code, not just because of the threat of nuclear weapons or personal empires, but also due to biochemical and medical technologies that are challenging our concept of what it means to be human.

- Deeply rooted in Freud, Watson, Skinner, Rogers, and Maslow's conceptual system
- Studied latest cognitive psychological theories
- Struggled with academic conflicts and different theories

**Gravesian Orientation:**
- Integrated bio-, psycho- and socio-dynamics
- Bridged disciplines and fields in human knowledge

**Conflict and Research:**
- Question: What makes a mature person?
- Thousand conceptualizations from people reflecting on their own maturity
- Initial attempt to map themes using Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
- Realized more patterns where people did not always ask individual questions
- Different people expressed different worldviews, stated different things over time

**Findings:**
- Human nature is not static or finite but an unfolding, emergent process
- Old systems stay with us as new systems are activated
- World is a open system of values with infinite models of living available
- No final stage to which we must all aspire.

**Graves' Assumptions:**
1. Human nature is not static or finite but changes with conditions
2. New systems form as older ones stay with us
3. World is a open system of values and infinite models of living
4. No final stage in human development.


#### Beyond Maslow and Other Development Minds

**Graves' Existential Staircase and Human Development**

**Background:**
- Graves (1974): proposed unique approach to human development beyond Maslow's hierarchy of needs
- Belief in additional levels, no final stage
- Healthy personality based on individual needs not guaranteed for next level

**Graves vs. Maslow:**
- Maslow: need satisfaction automatically leads to next level
- Graves: patterns emerged from data but no guarantee
- Depth of research and integral conceptualization of mature adult behavior

**Patterns in Human Development:**
- Two self-sacrificial systems and two expressive systems identified
- Initially, six different systems emerged (three sacrificial, three expressive)
- Concern about testing structures answers led to comprehensive speed-of-recognition-symbol test

**Themes in Human Development:**
- Two themes emerged: WE-orientated and ME-orientated system (Figure 2.3)


#### The Meeting of Two Visionary Minds

**The Architect of the Existential Staircase**

**Graves' Theories on Human Existence**:
- At each stage of life, the adult seeks to find the way of life to live by
- Discovers that the solution to existence is not what they thought it would be
- Each new stage leaves them "disconcerted and perplexed"
- The quest for existence is never-ending

**Meeting of Two Visionary Minds**:
- Beck read Graves' article in The Futurist, which presented a meta-analysis of themes of human emergence
- Beck was invited to visit Graves, and they connected immediately
- They began exploring the phenomenon of human existence together

**Spiral Dynamics**:
- In 1975, Beck visited Graves and discussed the "emergent, cyclical, double-helix, bio-psycho-social model"
- The eight categories that emerged are represented in Figure 2.5, labeled with their associated valuesystems (AN, BO, CP, DQ, ER, FS, GT, HU)
- Beck compared Gravesian thinking to 42 other systems describing human behavior and found it to be more systemic and integral

**Collaboration and Exploration**:
- Beck spent time at Graves' ranch, discussing the world and human dynamics
- They discussed the case of South Africa, where multiple thinking systems were in play


#### Clare Graves on the Future

**Beck and Graves' Relationship**
- Beck promised Graves he would always anchor his work in the deep, theoretical construct-based system that emerged from Graves' academic research (Figure 2.7)
- Beck instilled this discipline in his associates
- Prominent acknowledgement of Graves in this book confirms this stance

**Graves on the Future**
- Predicted a dramatic transformation of human institutions as part of humanity moving to a new level of existence (Figure 2.7)
- Humanity would be moving forward at an exponentially accelerating speed, resulting in thinking systems that would emerge
- Initial use of letter pairs (AN, BO, CP) was confusing; switched to numerical levels One, Two, Three; criticized for creating the impression that higher numbers were better
- Used names like Tribalistic, Egocentric, Absolutistic, but considered too simplistic
- Beck used colors since they were neutral, made possible graphic design of blends and hues, and were graphically attractive
- Warm colors assigned to expressive individual systems (AN became BEIGE, CP–RED, ER–ORANGE, GT–YELLOW)
- Cooler colors assigned to collective systems (BO–PURPLE; DQ–BLUE, FS–GREEN, HU for TURQUOISE)
- Called old values "subsistence levels" and new values "being levels"; viewed the latter as a "higher-grade reversal"
- Humanity would start again from a new beginning with the Yellow generation taking over the world and enabling a new humanity in the transcendence to the next level
- YELLOW was seen as BEIGE to the square, signifying questions of survival but at a different level of complexity (survival of self and others, humanity at large)

**Graves' Scenarios**
1. Chance that we might fail to stabilize our world, regress through successive catastrophes as far back as when humanity started
2. Fixation on the BLUE/ORANGE/GREEN social complex, promising a tyrannical, manipulative government with a glossy veneer of humanitarian thought and moralistic rationalizations
3. Emergence into the Second-Tier Yellow level and proceeding toward stabilizing our world so that all life could continue

**Importance of Understanding Thinking Structures**
- Leaders in social systems (individual, group, organizational, national or geopolitical) must understand different thinking structures or codes to avoid contributing to a diabolic loop of civilization
- Natural design principles are critical to prevent this; if we succeed in the last scenario, a new world will evolve with new life conditions stimulating new thinking structures

**Graves' Legacy and Beck's Contribution**
- Graves' history and research published in a work by Krumm, Parstoffer and Fayyad, highlighting that he did not get much credit for his research, deep insight, and theory while alive
- All interest and knowledge about the theory is due to Beck and Chris Cowan
- Beck promised Graves he would continue with his work and spent the next 50 years doing just that
- Graves is remembered fondly by the community and acknowledged for his foundational contribution to the field of study (Figure 2.8)


#### Conclusion

**Graves' Concepts: Spiral Dynamics and Adult Human Development**

**Background**
- Graves (1974): psychology of mature human being as unfolding, emergent process
- Mature development marked by progression from lower to higher order behaviors
- Piateton: Graves continued where he left off
- Conceptualization of adult existential theory forms basis of book

**Graves and Spiral Dynamics**
- Trusted Beck with the emergent, cyclical, double helix model of adult bio-psycho-social development
- Referred to as Spiral due to oscillating nature between I:ME:MINE and WE:US:OUR poles

**Discussion in Next Chapters**
- Explanation of Spiral (codes in people, not codes of people)
- Discussed in detail in chapters XX and YY.


### 3 The Code Book. Introduction. The Eight Codes

**Chapter Overview:**
- Shift from original theory to Beck's contribution in human development
- Emphasis on understanding cultural codes that shape our thinking and values
- The concept of a code as a framework for how people think about things, not the contents they fill it with
- Eight codes operating on Earth today: Zulus1 (tribal ethnic group), Apartheid era background
	+ Millions of Zulus living in urban settings with Westernized values
	+ Differentiated from stereotypes by understanding their underlying codes.

**Beck's Contribution:**
- Shift from original theory on human development by Professor Clare Graves
- Emphasis on societal dynamics and changing conditions
- Application of insights to individual, group, organizational, national, geopolitical levels

**Understanding Cultural Codes:**
- Definition: a framework for how people think about things, not the contents they fill it with
- Each code contains beliefs, ideals, morals, principles, and goals
- Eight codes existing today: Zulus1 (tribal ethnic group), others to be explored in following chapters.

**Colors Used in Codes:**
- No significance to colors used for the codes
- Chosen to avoid racial profiling during apartheid era discussions
- Neutrality maintains focus on understanding different codes in people, regardless of race or skin color.


#### The Double Helix of Code Change

**The Code Book: Understanding Worldviews and Values**

**Background:**
- Afrikaner of European ancestry stereotyped as traditional, religious farmer
- Urbanized Zulu and Afrikaner may have more in common than their fathers
- Leaders can design systems based on underlying codes rather than surface-level characteristics

**Colors and Codes:**
- Warm colors: BEIGE, RED, ORANGE, YELLOW - focus on individual mastery of environment (I, me, mine)
- Cool colors: PURPLE, BLUE, GREEN, TURQUOISE - focus on group or society's peace with environment (us, we, our)

**Codes:**
1. **BEIGE**: Survival (50,000 years ago) - food, water, warmth, sex, safety - cavemen and women
2. **PURPLE**: Tribal dynamics (50,000 to 10,000 years ago) - tribe and chiefs, elders, ancestors, rituals
3. **RED**: Empire building (10,000 years ago) - conquer, outfox, dominate others
4. **BLUE**: Purpose in transcendent cause or pathway (5,000 years ago)

**First-Tier "Subsistence" Codes:**
- BEIGE: Survival dynamics
- PURPLE: Tribal grouping and organization
- RED: Empire building and power dynamics
- BLUE: Transcendent purpose or beliefs

**Future Developments:**
- Emergence of Second-Tier "being" codes in the last 50 years - YELLOW and TURQUOISE.


##### Code evolution and human potential: Adaptive codes (BLUE, ORANGE, GREEN, YELLOW, TURQUOISE) interacting with life conditions in a double helix fashion.

**Codes and Human Potential**

**BLUE**:
- Enforces community order based on eternal, absolute principles
- Brings stability now and guarantees future rewards
- Judaism, Christianity, Islam sprung up during this period
- Basic building code for law and order

**ORANGE**:
- Appeared around 300 years ago
- Self-reliant and risk-taking individuals believed in change and advancement
- Achieve status and affluence through competition and seeking best solutions
- Free markets, industrialization, democracy, empirical scientific research emerged

**GREEN**:
- Seeking peace within the inner self and exploring caring dimensions of community
- Emergence of environmental movement and civil rights
- Believes we must rescue those left behind in march toward progress

**YELLOW**:
- Understanding that chaos and change are natural
- Integrating kaleidoscope of natural hierarchies, systems, and forms into interdependent, natural flows
- Values the magnificence of existence over material possessions
- Seeks to live fully and responsibly as an individual true to oneself

**TURQUOISE**:
- Views self as both distinct and blended part of a larger, compassionate whole
- Holistic, intuitive thinking and cooperative actions are expected to sustain all life
- The world is a single, dynamic organism, everything connects to everything else in ecological alignment

**CORAL**:
- Not yet discernible, but will emerge as humanity continues to evolve
- Newer, higher-order systems may follow

**Figure 3.1**: Different priority codes as described by Beck

**Code Change and Human Adaptation**:
- Life conditions change, humans adapt to new life conditions
- Complex adaptive intelligences arise in response to life conditions
- Two forces of life conditions and an adaptive intelligence interact, pushing evolution forward


##### Exploring human life conditions and priority codes shaping behaviors.

**Reproduction of Microorganisms and Human Minds**
- Rapid reproduction of microorganisms outsmart antibiotics
- Humans also recalibrate when life conditions change
- New codes created to handle problems in current environment
- Environment influences our social values and interactions

**Factors Influencing Life Conditions**
*Time*: Different eras and access to technology impact life conditions
*Place*: Geography shapes collective behaviors and values
*Human Problems: Unique challenges to cultures or individuals

**Priority Codes (Beck)**
- **Survival Priority Code**: Meet basic needs, survive at all costs
- **Bonding Priority Code**: Find safety and security, protect the nest/family
- **Egocentric Priority Code**: Challenge the "dragons," assert self, live for today
- **Holonic Priority Code**: Sense patterns of the whole, align all the dots, renew deep spirituality
- **Integral Priority Code**: Seek authenticity, think systemically, design complexity, embrace the natural
- **Humanistic Priority Code**: Restore human focus, find consensus, value equality, respond to feelings
- **Enterprising Priority Code**: Produce good life, create technology, achieve success, engineer progress
- **Purposeful Priority Code**: Conform to the cause/truth/belief, sacrifice for tomorrow, be disciplined.


#### The Me and We Wave of Code Change

**The Code Book: Understanding DNA Architecture and Social Circumstances**

**Component of Change:**
- Life conditions that pose problems and challenges: met by ways people think and their priority codes
- Interaction between external life conditions and internal priority codes creates behavior of individuals, groups or society

**Wave of Code Change:**
- Focus on "me" and "we" viewpoints
- Swings between expressing self and sacrificing self
- Changes in individual development or societal nature

**Components of Change:**
1. Life conditions (problems and challenges of existence)
2. How people think (what people think)
3. What people do (manifestations of the priority codes)
4. Beliefs and behavior (priority codes)

**Impact of Social Circumstances:**
- Unique to each individual: social ranking, genetic inheritance, intellectual or physical endowments
- Define borders for mobility and opportunity

**Components of Change:**
1. Life conditions
2. How people think
3. What people think
4. Beliefs and behavior (priority codes)

**Cycle of Code Emergence:**
- Entering phase: prophets and visionaries introduce new paradigms
- Peak phase: values and principles are codified, spreading widely
- Exiting phase: code becomes rigid and excessive, fades into emptiness

**Continuous Evolution:**
- No final state to our evolving codes
- New codes continue to emerge as life conditions become more complex.


### 4 Natural Design  The Ever-Emerging Ecology

**The Ebb and Flow of Code Change**
- **Circumstances can spiral us down as well as up through levels of complexity**:
    - Stressful life conditions can send us reeling down to a former code
    - Example: 9/11 attacks in America led to surge of patriotism and unity, pushing back down to a simpler code (Code BEIGE)
- **The nature of human codes is described**:
    - Codes emerge, surge, regress or fade in response to life conditions
    - Codes zigzag between expressing the self and sacrificing the self
    - Codes emerge along the spiral in wave-like fashion, entering, peaking and exiting
    - Codes co-exist within our own profiles like "nesting Russian dolls"
    - **Codes cluster in tiers of six along the spiral**
    - Codes spiral up and down through levels of complexity depending on life conditions

**Unhealthy Versions of Codes**:
- Can lead to abnormal and criminal actions, justified by the code
- Examples:
    - Unhealthy BLUE: Fixated on old interpretations, unable to transcend (e.g., rigid religious beliefs)
    - Unhealthy Red: Rampant looting and plundering after Hurricane Katrina

**The Multi-hued Nature of Codes**:
- Each new code includes every code that came before it
- This is important to understand for facilitating harmony and healthy movement between codes


#### Nested codes expand consciousness, bringing challenges at each level.

**Understanding Codes and Their Progression**

**Introduction to Codes**:
- Different notes can sound loud or mute at any moment, like an orchestra
- Characteristics of one code exist within another (like Russian dolls)
- No individual is a single code, we all contain multiple codes

**Expansion of Consciousness**:
- Movement towards greater complexity as knowledge and experiences expand
- Four characteristics:
  * Expansion of psychological space
  * Expansion of conceptual space
  * Expansion of choice
  * Expansion in behavioral freedom

**Challenges at the First-Tier Level**:
- Each code consistently scorns the old code left behind
- Progress is often seen as eliminating the old, but each code needs the previous one
- Example: Code ORANGE entrepreneur relies on Code BLUE for law and order

**Conclusion**:
- Expansion of consciousness causes great challenges at the First-Tier level
- Each code rules differently, with different values and behaviors
- Understanding the relationship between codes is key to navigating this complexity.


#### Understanding human thought patterns through codes and their impact on society. Spiral Dynamics application.

**Spiral Dynamics and the Master Code**

**Conundrums within Codes:**
- Even people operating under the same code may have conflicts (e.g., BLUE: Hindus vs Christians, Muslims)
- Fundamentalists believe their religion's truth may spring from various traditions

**The Eight Codes and Humanity's Master Code:**
- Describes how individuals think, not what they value within the code container
- Understanding Master Code enables deepest human motives and priorities
- Facilitates healthy codes for life condition transitions
- Impacts all areas of society (economics, geopolitics, religion, etc.)

**Barcodes:**
- A helpful way to display codes in individuals and collectives
- Figure 3.6: BarCode at play in the Middle East
- Misalignment between NGO activity and life conditions (PURPLE–RED vs ORANGE–GREEN services)

**Understanding Codes:**
- A framework of how people think, not what they think about
- Code container holds beliefs, ideas, morals, principles, and goals
- Old codes remain part of us, accessible when needed
- Incongruent old thinking systems may cause leaps to new orders (biological, psychological, societal, spiritual)

**Conclusion:**
- Discussed the concept and application of codes in this section.


#### The Basic Characteristics of Design

**Natural Design - The Ever-Emerging Ecology**

**Natural Design Concept**:
- Refers to a stance on psychology and biology that systemically studies concepts such as:
  - Internal feeling, motivation, adaptation, and development of a system
  - Rigid, artificial, and top-down leadership and management models are contrasted with natural design principles
- One-size-fits-all solutions are never helpful
- Critical to search for the DNA-like code at the core of the social system
- Awareness of the energy flow is critical

**Vital Signs Monitor**:
- Don Beck continuously uses new technologies in its development
- Understanding the total entity's response and needs is important

**Principles and Processes of "The Natural"**:
1. **Detecting the Ebb and Flow**:
   - Early detection of the social system's unique patterns in information dispersal and energy flow
2. **Leaders Detect Deepest VMEMEtic Code**:
   - In corporate suites, power centers, and specific organizational cultures/communities
3. **Spiral Dynamics Wizards**:
   - Can assist decision-makers in detecting the natural flow within their organization


#### Assortment of Natural Design Tools. Organizational Elegance

**Natural Design Tools for Leadership:**
- **Forging bottom lines**: setting clear expectations and goals
- **Implementing stream sequences**: following a linear sequence of events
- **Deciphering VMEMEtic codes**: interpreting patterns in communication
- **Constructing VMEMEtic maps**: visualizing relationships between ideas
- **Elaborating 4Q/8L quadrants**: analyzing complex situations from multiple perspectives
- **Creating VitalSignsMonitors**: tracking key performance indicators
- **Applying equations, compasses**: using mathematical and navigational tools
- **Observing cycles and adapting to them**: recognizing patterns in natural systems
- **Building scenarios and facilitating change**: planning for future possibilities
- **Synchronizing spirals (technical, business, human)**: coordinating different aspects of the organization
- **Assessing codes in people**: understanding how different personality types contribute to the team
- **Synthesizing approaches to leadership, organizational theory, and leadership styles**

**Second-Tier Leadership (YELLOW or GT):**
- Critical for distinguishing characteristics and value gifts of different codes in people
- Weaves all aspects of life together around a superordinate goal
- Releases human energy into the system to perform

**Organizational Elegance:**
- Connection of functions, forms, and fit of people
- Arousal and sustainability of focus, flow, and fulfillment of visions, needs, and aspirations
- Leadership creates behavioral framework or culture that facilitates engagement and fun
- Format of the 9 Fs should be followed: foresight, congruence, interrelatedness and integration, focus and flow, fulfilment, facilitation of fun, and superordinate goal.

**Organizational Design:**
- Building blocks of humanity in Figure 4.1 should be analyzed and wired together through inclusivity
- Second-Tier YELLOW integral leadership needed to identify, communicate, implement, and measure essential components of an elegant organization
- Organic, functional, and sustainable links can be made between elements (codes) to facilitate new code combinations for societal structures.


#### Natural Design Principles. Five Bottom Lines of Natural Design

**Natural Design Principles**

**Five Bottom Lines of Natural Design:**
- **Noble Purpose and Transcendent Goals**: Connecting what we do to something larger, beyond the self, giving meaning and significance to life. Lifts humans above daily concerns and offers the opportunity to become part of a whole or a cause they are willing to commit to.
- **Sound Principles and Efficient Processes**: Commitment to professionalism, learning the best and most cost-efficient ways, and avoiding waste and extravagance for the sake of ego or status appeals. Learning to do more with less, where productivity and performance result from natural design and effective people.
- **Responsible Profit with Multiple Usages**: Profit is seen as good, but it must be "responsible" - avoiding exploitation or gauging; "Multiple" - not just for the successful or "elite", but for the upliftment of the entire entity and to preserve and enhance its present viability while preserving a promising future.
- **Sensitivity to People and Societal Needs**: A heightened sensitivity to the needs of people, both inside and outside the enterprise, translating into respect for their total humanness and concern for the impact of the organization on their physical and emotional health. Leaders becoming more responsive to the needs of people in the local community, culture, and society.
- **Respect for the Natural Ecology of the PLANET and Systems**: Acknowledging the fragile nature of the physical environment and various ecosystems, understanding that spoiling our home planet will result in consequences for all. Respecting the integrity of various professions and the need to keep them honest, empowered, and respectable as they perform critical functions in society.


#### Integral Applications. Complex Adaptive Systems

**Spiral Dynamics and Complex Adaptive Systems**

**The Meme Factory**:
- Translates VMEME codes and Spiral Dynamics principles into:
    - **Integral selection and placement**: Matching people into job functions/responsibility levels
    - **Integral communication**: Learning to speak the language of different VMEME codes for messages, advertising, PR
    - **Integral motivation**: Activating multiple VMEME bottom lines to connect with natural motivational flow
    - **Integral marketing**: Determining key decision-making motives of entities (e.g., customers, stakeholders) to appeal

**Complex Adaptive Systems**:
- Spiral Dynamics was ahead of its time, not entangled in the conventional view of scientific/intellectual validity
- Organizations perceived as mechanisms and people as components from the outside, restraining us from embracing organizations as living systems with ecological properties

**Organizational Development: Tier 2, Natural Design and Living Systems**:
- Spiral Dynamics in Systems Design is caught up in the ORANGE worldview of the prevailing culture at the time
- Organizations are perceived as intelligent Complex Adaptive Systems (iCAS), not just mechanisms
- iCAS contains a series of moving, fragmented activities, indicating an intelligent system but with complexity not easily evident
    - This includes the processes of seeing and understanding, the information being seen, the process of interpretation and judgment, and the resulting communication
    - The intelligence is initially perceived in individual people, not the organization as a collective
    - The complexity is not the problem, but the unknown elements found in the people who exist across the iCAS

**VMEME Codes in an iCAS**:
- The cores of values and ethics of the different VMEME codes at play in an iCAS are represented in Figure 4.3


#### The Five Change States. Large-scale Transformation

**Spiral Dynamics in Action: The Five Change States**

**The Five Change States**:
- **Alpha**: A stable and balanced state where the individual/society is in sync with their life conditions
- **Beta**: A state of uncertainty, questioning, and frustration
- **Gamma**: A state of anger, hopelessness, and revolution
- **Delta**: A state of excitement, with the individual/society being enthusiastic and delicate
- **New Alpha**: The consolidation of ideas and insights, with the individual/society being in sync again

**Identifying the Spiral States**:
- In an iCAS, all Spiral codes should be identified, acknowledged, celebrated, aligned, and energized around a superordinate goal

**Yellow Thinking and Leadership**:
- Second-tier, Yellow (GT) leadership studies trends in the global domain and integrates multiple functions
- Yellow leaders design natural systems and structures, facilitating flexibility and flow
- The Yellow leader's leadership style is inclusive, engaging the hearts and minds of diverse people

**Natural Design Tools**:
- **rCodes**: Memetic DNA (mDNA) to get to the core intelligences where decisions are made
- **rMaps**: Surface-level displays of codes across physical and cultural terrain
- **rEquations**: Complex, calculus-like statements linking multiple functions and systemic alignments
- **rVital Sign Monitors (VSM)**: Physical or electronic places where critical indicators of an entity's health, well-being, and performance are collected
- **rScenarios**: Predetermined "stories about the future" within cones of possibility/probability
- **rCompass Settings**: Aligning Points, Nodes, and Zones


#### Templates. The Concept

**Large-Scale Transformation: Understanding Beliefs and Patterns for Successful Change**

**Understanding Beliefs**:
- To change, one must understand the underlying beliefs in the system
- Human codes can inform transformation possibilities

**Leadership**:
- Requires courage to remain firm in convictions
- A leader is not a leader without followers

**Processes**:
- Needed for individual stories to be woven together into a shared understanding

**Significance and Commitment**:
- Significance must be created to commit to transformation
- Often dawns on people when they participate in integral inclusivity processes

**Energizing the Workforce**:
- Involving people unleashes energy, which must be utilized around the task at hand or else may become disruptive

**Leveraging Systemic Leverage Points**:
- For maximum impact, identify key issues and problems that need solutions

**Templates: Natural Designs for Successful Transformation**

**Template X: Natural Forms and Flows**
- Outlines the most natural designs for critical functions

**Template Y: People Factors and Management Systems**
- Accounts for issues related to rank, ideology, interpersonal relations, traditions, and territory

**Template Z: Command Intelligence**
- Addresses specific life conditions and VMEME typologies in a social system

**Figure 4.5**: Ten Conditions for Large-Scale Change (Beck, 2006)


#### Template X. Template Y. Six Conditions for Change

**Spiral Dynamics: Templates X, Y, and Z**

**Template X:**
- Includes all variables impacting job performance
- Visualized as a network or complex system (e.g., strategic alliance)
- Helps link together all factors influencing workflow
- Prevents failure of initiatives like TQM and re-engineering due to misunderstanding of Spiral Dynamics
- Use competency models for matching people to jobs

**Template Y:**
- Accesses memetic codes and patterns of those who perform tasks on Template X
- Enriches, strengthens, and fixes the X template
- Fine-tunes workflow and monitors vital signs
- Enhances competencies of people during work
- Aligns Y with X: How to manage people in relation to their jobs?

**Template Z:**
- Links X and Y templates to society
- CEOs and executive managers recognize incomplete knowledge and insight, especially regarding human dynamics
- Purpose is to command intelligences (collective wisdom, knowledge, judgment) of a social system
- May have an Executive Core (EC) that reshapes the company based on life conditions
- Requires people with high energy, interest, and scruples.


### Condition 1. Condition 2. Condition 4

Desire forms Bodies Without Organs (BwO) on the plane of consistency; distinguish desirable BwOs from empty or cancerous ones using an abstract machine that creates connections.


#### Condition 5. Condition 6. PART 2 Spiral Dynamics Global

**Spiral Dynamics Model: Six Conditions for Successful Change**
- **Condition 1**: Identify barriers to change and reframe them
- **Condition 2**: Possess insight into what caused previous thinking structure to fail
- **Condition 3**: Understand new resources available for dealing with the problem
- **Condition 4**: Recognize emergence of new life conditions
- **Condition 5**: Consolidation and support during transition
- **Condition 6**: All six criteria must be met for successful change outcome

**Spiral Dynamics Model (2006): Complex Adaptive Intelligences Forming Codes That Bond Groups Together**
- Cultures and countries formed by emergence of codes in response to life conditions
- Natural motivational flow is key to understanding complex dynamics of social, emerging systems
- Different methods and tools of natural design discussed

**Question from Beck**: How should Whole lead Whom to What for Which People living Where and Why?

**Part 2:**
- South African Crucible Revisited: Uncovering Indigenous Intelligence (Israel and Palestine)
- The Nordic Countries and Second-Tier Consciousness: Need for Second-Tier Leadership in Times of Great Turbulence.


### 5 Back to the Future  The South African Crucible Revisited. A Background to the History of South Africa

**The South African Crucible Revisited: Beck's Role in Transitioning to Democracy**

**Background:**
- In 1990, F.W. de Klerk announced the demolishment of racial division systems in South Africa (New South Africa)
- This caused issues due to different value systems
- Beck, an American from Texas, made numerous private visits to South Africa during this time
- Believed that alignment of multiple intelligences could create balance and success for South Africa

**South African Dynamics Before Democracy:**
- Apartheid and social uprisings at an all-time high
- Heavy American sanctions on the economy
- Divided country: Afrikaner rule vs. uprisings, different value systems present (RED, BLUE, ORANGE, PURPLE)
- European settlers introduced BLUE and RED values; Boers claimed land, displaced African tribes (PURPLE)
- Afrikaner nationalism rose to power after 1948 elections, establishing BLUE control
- ORANGE value system emerged with entrepreneurial opportunities
- Discontent from the previously disadvantaged population led to fighting for freedom and better living conditions
- External pressure from other countries fueled aspirations of the oppressed people

**Beck's Role in Transition:**
- Applied Graves' double-helix model with color representation of value systems
- Met with various leaders, political party heavyweights, National Peace Committee, and businesses to initiate change
- Unveiled Spiral Dynamics theory and co-created transition plan for 1994 elections, Rugby World Cup, and post-Apartheid South Africa.


#### The South African Negotiating Table

**Spiral Dynamics in Action: South African Negotiations**

**Background:**
- Afrikaner people faced serious attack on their safety and system
- Beck used color value systems to understand political leadership in South Africa
- Goal was to prevent civil war through negotiation at the "South African Negotiating Table"

**Color Valuesystems:**
* **BEIGE**: Reflexive instincts and survival senses (not actively contributing) - 9% of population
* **PURPLE**: Communal contribution, decision by elders (important relationships) - 65% of population
* **RED**: Everything done on their terms, power through threats/intimidation - 15% of population
* **BLUE**: Relies on rules, law, structure and respect for process - 10% of population
* **ORANGE**: Negotiations and deal-making as part of nature (power alliances) - 1% of population
* **GREEN**: Consensus decision, lack of hierarchy, everyone heard (emerging from the crucible of differences) - 0.1% of population

**Negotiation Process:**
- Different value systems and alliances causing discomfort and frustration
- South Africa had mid-poles within Spiral Dynamics valuesystems: large PURPLE base, flash of RED, strong BLUE prevalent among Afrikaners and Africans, hints of ORANGE and GREEN
- Important to understand codes for effective negotiations: BEIGE not contributing, PURPLE requires communal contribution, RED power via threats/intimidation, BLUE relies on rules and structure, ORANGE sees negotiations as part of nature, GREEN insists on consensus decision.

**Challenges:**
- Tension increased as opposing poles within the same value system clashed (undoing the foundation of behavior)
- Only solution: integral and functional way to restore viability of country

**Complexity:**
- All systems in model at play in South African context, making it a natural laboratory for studying thinking patterns in an integral society.


#### Doing the Work in South Africa

**Background**
- Keith E. Rice documented South African story on Integrated Socio-Psychology blog
- First appearance of Beck in South Africa: Sun City conference (1981)
- 63 trips to the country until 2013, final trip being his 64th
- A vital signs monitor was used to portray dynamics at play in the South African context in 1988 (Figure 5.3)

**Beck's Impact on South Africa**
- Facilitated Spiral Dynamics sessions with Laubscher
- Attended parliament, participated in development work
- Consulted political leaders and actively participated in forming a new South Africa
- Gave interviews, lectures, and broadcasts (TV, radio)
- Published articles in major South African newspapers (April 1989)
- Met with Mandela after his release from prison

**Peace Negotiation Processes**
- Facilitated by neutral church leaders and businessmen from various races
- Businessmen funded Beck's trips to South Africa, established National Peace Committee
- Superordinate goal, shared values, and symbols provided through sports and cultural events
- Tangible improvements were necessary.

**Figure 5.3: Flow of Conscious Democracy**

**Beck’s Influence on Mandela**
- Unknown to Beck, Mandela read his articles in prison
- Arranged a meeting between Beck, Laubscher and himself after release.


#### A New South Africa

**Beck's Role in South Africa's Transformation**

**Background:**
- Beck challenged value systems in South Africa, promoting integration and democracy
- Initial opposition from both Americans and South Africans due to past oppression by white Afrikaners

- **Beck given special name:** AmiziMuthi – meaning "the one with the strong medicine" (Zuluname)

**Negotiations and New Paradigm**
- Focus on 6 crucial features:
  1. **The Law of the Spiral**: Human beings adapt and change thinking systems, enabling new paradigms
  2. **Multiple Intelligences**: Different value systems act as "bio-psycho-social DNA"; each has its own intelligence
  3. **Integrative Structures**: Integration of gifts from each value system strengthens the Spiral
  4. **Power of the Paradox**: Synthesis needed to create new paradigm and order of thinking and being
  5. **The Rule of SOME**: All groups reminded to add "SOME" in statements about race, age, or gender
  6. **Value Management**: Importance of creating something new instead of adding up parts, addressing disparities and past hurts

**Valuesystems and Spiral**
- Each value system presents its own intelligence, bringing strengths to the table
- Need to acknowledge and make apparent in management of South Africa as a whole
- Oppressors also form part of this whole

**Integrative Structures and Value Management**
- Integration of gifts from each valuesystem strengthens the Spiral through interdependent and dynamic relationships among levels
- Importance of Value Management: disciplined decision-making process for solving complex technical and human problems. Everyone involved in the decision-making process with specific, practical, and workable solutions.

**Inclusivity and Transformational Process (Viljoen, 2008)**
- Radical transformational process that integrates different thinking systems around a commonly defined goal.

### 6 Uncovering the Indigenous Intelligence A Case Study of Israel and Palestine. The Birth of New Indigenous Thinking

**The Indigenous Intelligence: A Case Study of Israel and Palestine**

**The Exercise of Getting Ready for Statehood**:
- Represented a concern for some as it represented unilateralism by the Palestinians
- This was seen as "unilateralism" by the Palestinians, but should be about building a Palestinian state and their own statehood
- If Palestinians don't build it, who will?

**The Birth of New Indigenous Thinking**:
- On a moonlit night in 2004, two men - Raffi Nasser and Neri Bar-On - sat at an outdoor cafe in Tel Aviv
- Raffi Nasser was a successful securities trader of Arab Jewish descent, while Neri Bar-On was a celebrated star in the microchip industry
- They discussed bringing lasting security and peace to their beloved Israel through new methods
- This conversation led to the first use of "memetics" and "large-scale psychology" to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict

**Understanding Cultural Value Systems**:
- The failure to understand each other's cultural value systems was a significant insight
- This represented the first substantive change in the Israeli approach over the past 3 decades
- It could be the ultimate tool for facilitating peace and building essential skills at all levels of society

**The Spiral Dynamics Approach**:
- The authors had been following Don Beck's work on spiral dynamics and large-scale psychology
- They aimed to place this approach in the hands of Israelis to help them understand their neighbors from a cultural value-systems perspective
- This could break every stereotype on both sides

**Preparing for Action**:
- Preparations began in earnest to put a framework in place


#### PURPLERED Villages and BLUEORANGE Towns

**The Search for Qualified Partners in the Middle East Conflict Resolution Initiative**

**Don Beck's Transparency and Seventh-Level Yellow Leadership**:
- Don Beck presented the qualities of transparency needed for Seventh-Level Yellow leadership
- The author began a search for similarly qualified Palestinians to work with

**Discovering Potential Partners**:
- Nafiz Rifai, a third-generation Fatah leader, had spent time in Israeli jails and created a learning community
- Abdel Majid Suwaiti was a respected member of the Palestinian community
- Both men were fighters who turned to the power of words rather than guns to find peaceful solutions

**Preparing for the Initiative**:
- Beck and the author spent months communicating with their new partners on both sides to ensure understanding of the project's goals
- The team carefully coached both sides to find center positions in each culture before bringing them together
- Beck declined Israel or U.S. State Department funding, instead turning to "conscious" CEOs who understood the values of the Seventh-Level Yellow system

**The Middle East Trip**:
- In February 2006, Don Beck and the author made their first trip to the Middle East with Susan Vance, a former U.S. Air Force Colonel representing Hearthstone Global Foundation
- John Smith, the founder of Hearthstone, was a conscious business leader who had never visited Israel or Palestine but understood Beck's work
- The author experienced extensive questioning by Israeli customs due to his Arab heritage, with Beck staying with him throughout the process.


##### South African framework presented in Israel: Culture and politics through the Spiral Dynamics lens.

**Trip to Israel: Experiences and Insights**

**Encountering Differences:**
- Heard complaints about his treatment by an Israeli journalist from Haaretz

- Filmed interviews by the "Wall of Separation" or "Wall of Injustice" that separates Israel from the West Bank.
- Understood the perspective of Palestinians on the concrete barrier during tour.


##### Building bridges between Israeli and Palestinian communities through hearts and minds approach.

**The Wall Separating Families and Neighbors**
- The wall separated families and neighbors
- Opportunity to direct passion towards reducing rhetoric
- Goal: Bring both sides to the center position of moderates, pragmatists, and conciliators
- Influence cultures to have codes of self-reliance, respect for institutions, desire for prosperity, and peaceful coexistence
- No military effort included in this strategy

**Appeal to Both Populations**
- Hearts and minds appeal to both populations
- Define themselves by codes of self-reliance, respect, prosperity, and peaceful coexistence
- Inject these codes through media

**Palestinian Resilience and Opportunity**

#### Empathy and the Five-Deep Strategy

**Understanding an Ails Culture: The Palestinian Case**
* First visit to Palestine pioneered new methods for uncovering dynamics contributing to conflict
* Goal: Teach framework, listen and learn from open-minded individuals
* Essential element in Indigenous Design process
* Listening at a deep level takes on a different dimension
* Addresses surface behavior and employs five-layer deep strategy
* Peace accords are political manipulations, not culture-wide solutions
* Look under the surface to understand real-world life conditions, fears, and values

**Assessing Cultural Complexity: The Middle East Conflict (Figure 6.1)**
* Examine memetic codes of each culture
* Explore what/who is held in highest esteem and priorities
* Look at life conditions within each culture
	+ Factors that make VMEMEs surge, emerge, regress or fade
	+ Peace treaties: Transformational vs. another translation of previous failures
	+ Both sides' views of history and how they affect design and culture
* Examine the role of place in conflict as both sides claim ancestral land
* Internal challenges for each culture
* External influences on internal circumstances (military, financial, international aid)
* Power mechanism controlling flow of resources

**Listening and Learning: Gaining Insights from Stakeholders**
* Politicians, peace negotiators, academics, business leaders, educated women and young people in Israel
* Parliamentarians, governors, professors, leaders of women's and youth organizations on the Palestinian side
* Understanding codes that define a successful Palestine
* Patterns from Israel: What it means to be under constant threat of attack

**First Year Research Findings:**
* Both sides expected a partner in peace to be fully developed in the BLUE Fourth-Level system
* Little effort made to assure Palestinian institutions would maintain presence at this stage of development
* Significant factor assessed: Readiness for change within each culture (Arrested or Closed in any part of their value systems)


#### Creating Israels VMEMEtic Profile

**Spiral Dynamics in Action: Israel's VMEMEtic Profile**

**Background:**
- Surprising enthusiasm during a conference on Beck's insights in South Africa
- Possible reasons for interest: learning new perspectives or desire for change
- Haaretz's article (2008) captured approach: "Instead of coexistence, live and let live. I prefer prosper and let prosper, grow and let grow."

**Creating Israel's VMEMEtic Profile:**
- Prosperity strategy as a key driver in nation-building psychology
- Rooted in Beck's prediction of peace accord failure (2014)
- Cultural development stages: difference between Israelis and Palestinians
- Data from first year engagement: Israel has center gravity in BLUE–ORANGE values
  - Founding principles born out of Industrial Age, Europe
  - Institutions and belief in rule of law since creation (1948)
  - Respect for institutions is foundation of society
  - Criticism against treatment of Palestinians but individual rights exceed Arab countries
  - Support from Jewish diaspora, political lobby in the US, resilience in people.

**Israel's VMEME Profile:**
- BLUE: Beginning of abstract thinking, replaces personal power with institution power
- Presence of dense BLUE code defining a complex culture
- Foundation for first-world countries, organizations, and human society
- Support from Jewish diaspora and political lobby in the US ensures resilience.


##### Israeli political analysis using Spiral Dynamics: Accountability, military training, and Kadima Party's shift towards orange values.

**Israeli Political Scandals and VMEMEtic Profiles**

**Prime Minister Olmert's Resignation**:
- Olmert was being investigated for accepting an illegal campaign contribution/bribe, leading to his resignation as prime minister
- This was a BLUE code that showed how the different branches of government functioned and how the culture held elected officials accountable

**Culture of Law and Order in Israel**:
- The Israeli system prioritizes the rule of law and order
- Olmert respected this code in his resignation speech, stating "I am proud to be a citizen of a country in which a prime minister can be investigated like any other citizen"

**Limitations of BLUE Values**:
- This particular brand of BLUE has not yet emerged in many parts of the Arab world or elsewhere
- In the United States, scandals rarely reach the level of absolute clarity that led to Olmert's resignation

**Israeli Defense Ministry and Knesset Profiles**:
- Beck worked with Israeli partners to profile the Israel Defense Ministry and the Knesset
- The Defense Ministry exhibited advanced ORANGE technologies and training, but lagged in understanding the cultural codes of their neighbors
- Military intelligence was superior, but soldiers lacked the psycho-social skills to understand the cultural dynamics of the region

**Kadima Party and Unilateral Disengagement**:
- The Kadima Party, led by former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, represented a pragmatic position on Israel's entry into ORANGE political values of "let's make a deal"
- With unilateral disengagement from settlements in Gaza and the West Bank, Hamas declared it as a victory and took control of Gaza, undermining Palestinian Authority and weakening Kadima
- This confirmed that when Israel is under an existential threat, all sides shift to a patriotic (hard-core) BLUE position, making any peace efforts or negotiations from other spectrum positions disappear


##### Value system profiles and Israeli cultural disconnect: ORANGE, GREEN, BLUE, and PURPLE.

**Israel's Value System Profiles**

**Figure 6.2: Israeli Values When Conflict is Not Present**
- ORANGE-Green profile: older entrepreneurs, sense of patriotic responsibility towards solving the conflict, traditional Orange had healthiest expressions
- ORANGE of knowledge economy represented a different VMEME and disconnected from political process
  * Innovative young entrepreneurs wanted to feel in charge of their destiny
  * Disconnected from reality on the ground, wanted to live and prosper in denial
- Palestinians, Arabs, and Israeli political establishment not present within Israel's VMEME profile
  * Focused on using methodologies for competitive edge in business practices rather than being bogged down by slow peace process
  * Lives moved at the speed of the internet

**Figure 6.3: Israel's Values When Culture is Under Existential Threat**
- ORANGE-Patriotic: traditional Orange had patriotic expressions, older entrepreneurs built modern Israel, listened to dialogue to resolve conflict
- BLUE-Patriotic: Maalouf (2014) notes that Green codes appeared in mothers and grandmothers helping Palestinians, former IDF soldiers seeking deeper understanding of human nature.


#### VMEMEtic Profile of the Palestinian Territories

**Spiral Dynamics in Action: Palestinian Territories**

**Israeli Integral Salons**:
- Attracted individuals from every background representing Israel's potential to ascend to the Seventh-Level Yellow system
- Could not reach critical mass to redefine Israeli values due to lack of political clout

**RED (Defiant Flamethrowers)**:
- Represented by religious Zionists with entitlement and defiance towards Israeli military actions
- Included settlers who opposed unilateral disengagement plan from Gaza and West Bank
- Also included some Orthodox Jews in Jerusalem who refuse to serve in the military on religious grounds

**GREEN (Occupy Movement)**:
- Exposed inequality between rich and poor, leading to new social movement in Israel

**Palestinian Territories: VMEMEtic Profile**

**ORANGE**:
- Lack of leadership qualified to unify society into a single goal

**BLUE**:
- Minimal overall BLue emerging in business, academia, women, and millennial generation
- Hamas was the new, honest Blue provider of services to most Palestinians

**RED (Hamas)**:
- Ignited grassroots movement through calling for new Palestinian Blue based on Islamic fundamentalism
- Old parochial Islamic Blue

**PURPLE (Fatah)**:
- Lost 2006 general election to Hamas, desperate to find answers
- Invited Beck, Rifai, and Suwaiti to train top-ranking members of the third generation Fatah

**Training with Hamas Moderates**:
- Differed starkly from Fatah trainees
- Showed lack of respect for rules and etiquette, reflecting their RED values
- Beck used this as a "teachable moment" to show how lack of respect would undermine their authority with decision-makers


#### The Creation of a Superordinate Goal

**Uncovering Indigenous Intelligence: The BuildPalestineInitiative (BPI)**

**Background:**
- Training completed, high-ranking participant reclaimed ancestral honor for future generations
- Focus shifted towards building new institutions instead of dwelling on the past

7. **Functional Capitalism**: Implementing practices that benefit humanity and the environment (ORANGE–GREEN)
8. **Corporate Social Responsibility**: A draw towards ORANGE innovation in a global and local economic context
9. **VMEMEs in Israel**: Good match for potential future relationships in many Western regions
10. **Seventh-Level YELLOW**: The corporate social responsibility movement as a source of inspiration for the future vision

**Creating a Superordinate Goal:**
- Preventing political corruption and dysfunction
- Making every Palestinian proud of the goal
- Inclusivity: Avoiding premature declarations that may exclude meaningful segments of society.

**Potential Challenges:**
1. **Regional and Global Power Support**: Ensuring all stakeholders can support the superordinate goal

**Bargh-outi Led Exercise on Israel's Defense Layers:**
* Demonstrated how **Israel surrounded the West Bank and Gaza with RED settlers** as a first line of defense against any **RED activity from Palestine**
* BLUE checkpoints and IDF presence represented another memetic layer, running across Jerusalem and at every entry and exit point from the West Bank
* BLUE presence was heaviest where it supported the areas around the RED settlers and at the Lebanese and Syrian borders, creating a buffer zone to protect the ORANGE business community
* **ORANGE** was in the center of the country, while the ORANGE-GREEN of the knowledge economy occupied the coastal areas from Gaza to the border of Lebanon
* Palestinian millennial generation view of the map of Israel, as presented by Maalouf (2014), is shown in **Figure 6.6**

**Creating a New Narrative:**
* As more Palestinians were exposed to this new perspective on the conflict, Rifai and his team were referred to as "the spiral people"
* Grassroots efforts had grown into a movement that could no longer be ignored by the summer of 2007
* Senior members of Fatah wanted to know the nature of the framework from Rifai, Beck, and me
* Cabinet members and executive committee members from Fatah wanted to know how this theory might translate into more effective governance on the ground
* Rifai suggested holding a national summit where community leaders could share their ideas on the future of Palestine

- Many authors influenced by First-Tier thinking and consciousness
- Concern about human ability to adapt in a rapidly changing world
- Criticism of books written from a narrow, past-focused perspective

**Spiral Dynamics:**
- Minds under exclusive control of Red, Blue, Orange or Green VMEMEs are convinced they already have the answer
- Change from what VMEMEs to what VMEMEs?
- Attempts to change thinking and behavior while ignoring role of VMEMEs are naive and ineffective
- Five essential questions related to VMEME shifts:
  - How and under what conditions are new VMEMEs awakened?
  - How can one increase or decrease the power of specific VMEMEs?
  - Why are some VMEMEs amenable to influence while others resist change?
  - How can you recognize, understand, and influence the processes of natural VMEME change and transition?
  - How do various VMEMEs on the Spiral impact each other during profound change?

**Nordic Countries:**
- Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland: Advanced thinking in the world
- Majority indicates a strong Green consciousness


#### A GREEN Denmark. Professor Francis Fukuyama

**Spiral Dynamics in Action: Denmark as a Green Country**

**Dominant Green Consciousness**:
- Countries like Netherlands, Switzerland, west/east coast US, Germany, UK have dominant Green consciousness
- Characteristics of such a society:
  - All citizens have access to child care, state-guaranteed medical and parental leave, free college tuition, high-quality hospitals, health care, generous pension plans
  - High taxes (25% goods/services tax, up to 60% marginal tax rate)

**Historical Perspective**:
- Professor Francis Fukuyama's analysis in 1995:
  - Most prosperous countries are those where business can be conducted on the basis of trust
  - Neoclassical economics ignored culture as a growth variable
  - Social Capital: ability to work together, trust, acquisition of virtues like loyalty, honesty, dependability
  - Trust and other cultural virtues can be easily destroyed by large centralized governments or extreme individualism

**Nordic Countries' Development**:
- Crucial role played by four popular movements in the second half of 19th century:
  1. Folk high schools
  2. Cooperative movement
  3. Trade unions
  4. Women's movement
- These movements pushed Nordic societies up the Spiral, keeping pace with increasing life complexity


#### Qualities of a Typical GREEN VMEME CountryState

**Spiral Dynamics in Action: The Nordic Countries**

**The Danish Popular Movements**:
- Described on the website [www.spiraldynamicsglobal.com](http://www.spiraldynamicsglobal.com)
- Information about the Nordic countries can be found at [www.nordicsecret.org](http://www.nordicsecret.org)

**The Four Critical Danish Popular Movements**:
1. **The folk high-school movement**
2. **The cooperative movement**
3. **The trade union movement**
4. **The women's movement**

**Nordic Welfare States**:
- Developed and later outlived some of the critical VMEME qualities of a typical GREENVMEME
- Expected to see clear signs of Second-Tier consciousness, such as the emergence of the YELLOWVMEME

**Qualities of a Typical GREENVME Country/State**:
- **Trust**: Denmark and the Nordic countries have exceptionally high levels of societal trust
- Increase in trust between 1979 and 2009 can be attributed to:
    - Generational replacement
    - Increasing levels of education
    - Improved quality of state institutions
    - Increase in citizens' trust in these institutions

**The Nordic Countries as the Best-Governed in the World**:
- The Nordic countries are gathered near the top on measures of the health of a society, from economic indicators like productivity and innovation to social ones like inequality and crime.


##### Exploring the Nordic Region's Success: Trust, Pragmatism, and Happiness

**Nordic Success: The Role of Trust**

**Background:**
- Nordic region's success attributed to transparency, pragmatism, and toughness

**Values**
- Values research from The World Values Survey (WVS) and Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map Analysis
- Two major dimensions: traditional values vs. secular–rational values, survival values vs. self-expression values
- Moving upward on the Spiral reflects shift from traditional to secular–rational values; moving rightward reflects shift from survival to self-expression values
- Traditional values: emphasis on religion, parent–child ties, deference to authority and traditional family values; reject divorce, abortion, euthanasia, suicide; high national pride and ethnocentric outlook
- Secular–rational values: opposite preferences of traditional values; less emphasis on religion, traditional family values, and authority; divorce, abortion, euthanasia, suicide are relatively acceptable; emphasis on environmental protection, gender equality, participation in decision-making
- Survival values: emphasis on economic and physical security; linked with a relatively ethnocentric outlook, low trust and tolerance
- Self-expression values: give high priority to environmental protection, gender equality, rising demands for participation in economic and political life

**Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)**
- Measures the perception of corruption in 175 countries
- Gauges corruption in governments, police, courtsystems, political parties, and bureaucracies
- Rankings are used by various stakeholders to stop abuse of power, bribery, and secret deals.


##### Corruption, populism, circular economy, business growth, Danish recommendations.

**Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index 2016:**
* Published five days after Trump's inauguration
* Expressed concern over links between populism, socio-economic malaise, and anti-corruption agenda
* Populist leaders connect "corrupt elite" to working people's marginalization
* Evidence supports this relationship, but track record of populist leaders in addressing problem is dismal
* Top performers on index: high levels of press freedom, access to budget information, integrity, and effective judiciaries

**Circular Economy:**
* Ellen MacArthur Foundation defines circular economy as restorative and regenerative by design
* Distinguishes technical and biological cycles
* Danish companies moving towards adoption due to business benefits: new markets, innovative solutions, cost savings
* Recommendations for circular economy transition in Denmark: Make it the growth engine for Danish companies, establish municipalities based on circular economy, integrate principles in education.

**Ease of Doing Business:**
* Forbes' 2017 list ranks Sweden (No 1), Denmark (6), Finland (7), and Norway (8) out of 139 countries for business friendliness.


##### Forbes ranks countries based on investment climate using 11 factors; Denmark transitions from Green to emerging Yellow.

**Forbes' World Economy Rankings (2017)**
- Forbes assessed 11 factors to determine most inviting countries for capital investment: property rights, innovation, taxes, technology, corruption, freedom (personal, trade & monetary), red tape, investor protection, and stock market performance.
- Data sourced from Freedom House, Heritage Foundation, Property Rights Alliance, Transparency International, World Bank Group, and World Economic Forum.
- United States fell one spot to 23rd place due to declining scores on trade and monetary freedom, as well as increasing red tape.
- Sweden moved up four spots towards the top of the charts for the first time (ranked No. 17 in 2006).
- Denmark and other Nordic countries are transitioning from GREEN to emerging YELLOW consciousness, facing challenges with immigration and high costs of providing for everyone without contributions.

**Characteristics of "Unhealthy" Green Meme**:
- Slow decision-making due to over adherence to consensus seeking
- Pressure to be supportive of collective decisions and actions
- Vulnerability to collective guilt
- Blindness to the rest of the Spiral
- Pronounced narcissism
- Compromised quality-of-life including stress, burnout, and neglected discipline, authority, and norms.

**Emergence of Second-Tier Consciousness**:
- Societies realize the cost of all the caring in terms of both economics and human energy.
- Profitability and productivity may drop while unexpected costs increase.
- Huge and easy immigration challenges the existing "order".

**Transition from GREEN to YELLOW**:
- Denmark and other Nordic countries are struggling with this transition phase from GREEN to emerging YELLOW.
- It remains unclear whether these countries will face up to Second-Tier complexity and problems, or try to handle regressions into greedy ORANGE, hard-nosed BLUE, and tumultuous RED.
- The collective process of GREEN does not match the contemporary 7th code life conditions and issues because it consumes too much time and energy.

**Einstein's Quotation**:
- "Make things as simple as possible but not simpler." (Albert Einstein)


##### Exploring societal transition to higher consciousness: the Nordic countries and Second-Tier evolution.

**The Spiral of Human Development: Shaping Our Psychology**

**Background:**
- We are shaped by the spiral of human development

##### Anticipating societal transformation from Green meme to Yellow meme through global turmoil and political instability.

**Spiral Dynamics in Action: The Approaching Leap to the Second Tier**

**The Decline of Green Meme (GREENVMEME)**
- Green system is breaking down in many post-modern societies, leading to energy for next level of being (YELLOW)
- Symptoms include frustration, confusion, discontent following election results, Brexit, nationalism, protectionism, etc.
- Could potentially result in explosive outcomes or a revolution

**The Need for Change: Invitation to Step Up and Prepare for the Next Level**
- Current situation contains revolutionary potential, but not necessarily violent revolution
- Hegel's theory of quantity and quality: sudden leap into qualitatively different thing when preparing for growth/destruction
- Political turmoil in various countries (US, EU, Russia, etc.)
- Unemployment rates among young generations in Southern Europe
- Terrorist attacks, political dissatisfaction among youth, tense situations, etc.
- Precariat all over the world building up energy

**Global Turmoil: Mixture of Sources and Implications**
- Post-modern Western world: GREENVMEME has peaked and is gradually fading, leaving behind a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world.
- Different VMEMES gravity centers (PURPLE, RED, BLUE, ORANGE, GREEN) with varying consequences and implications depending on time, place, and circumstances.


##### Predictions of societal evolution and the importance of understanding different levels of existence.

**Transition from Green (G) to Yellow (Y) Vmeme**
* Purpose of GT code: bring planet back to equilibrium for survival
* Renewable resources play a greater role in future society
* GT world is more advanced technologically but naturalistic
* GT people have no fear of technology and understand consequences
* Predictions written in 1974

**Graves's Perspective on Survival and Advancement**
* Man must realize each level to rise to next higher one
* Values must be pursued to their limits for recognition of existential problems
* Fully understanding lower levels essential for advancement (Green)

**Implications and Predictions by Graves**
* Society will rely on renewable resources
* Advanced technology coexists with naturalistic lifestyle
* GT people overcome fear of technology
* Recognition of limits necessary for advancement

**Transition from Green to Yellow: A Challenge**
* Fully realizing lower levels essential before moving up
* Pursuing values to their limits for recognition of higher-order problems.


#### Concluding Remarks

**Nordic Countries and Second-Tier Societies**
* Complexity of humanity and social/cultural evolution
* Quantity vs. quality: Hegel's law and its application to population, information, insight, education
	+ Potential for qualitative transformations with numerical increase
* Denmark and the Nordic countries in 19th century: folk high schools, cooperative movement, trade unions, women's movement
	+ Importance of addressing the "gap" between groups
* Impact of numerical size on societal memetic development
	+ Caveat: mind the gap

**Cognitive Capacities and Adaptive Intelligences as a Prerequisite for Progress**
* Graves's research: human species' progress up each ladder of existence (Maslow's hierarchy of needs)
* Less time spent at each new step
* Question to answer: Sufficient cognitive capacity in Denmark and the Nordic countries to prevent fixation at GreenVmeme or regression to lower levels?


#### Denmark and the Spiral Preparing for the Next Vertical Up-Shift

**Spiral Dynamics in Action:** Denmark and Nordic Countries

**Understanding the Need for Higher Cognitive Capacity (GT Level)**

**Asking Critical Questions**
- Are Denmark and Nordic countries ready for "leap" to Second Tier consciousness?
- Do they possess cognitive capacity, political vision, determination, energy, potential?
- Has this surge already begun or is it a metamorphosis?
- What level of anxiety/fear exists in these societies?

**Metamorphosis: Epochal Change of Worldviews (U. Beck 2016)**
- Global reality constitutes everybody's strategic lived reality
- Struggle between competing images of the world leads to fierce conflicts and bloody conquests
- Call for fast development of Second Tier consciousness

**Denmark and Spiral Dynamics: Preparing for Next Vertical "Up-Shift"**
- Signs of emerging Second Tier consciousness at societal levels in Denmark (political, economic, environmental, social, cultural)
- Hypothesis: Denmark has outlived qualities of Green Meme and should begin expressing Second Tier adaptive intelligence if cognitive capacity is available.

**Change from What to What?**
- Importance of understanding the transition from existing state to desired future state (change from what we don't want to what we do want)
- Denmark as a potential role model for developing, building, facilitating, and nurturing the development of Second Tier consciousness.


## PART 3 The Surge in a Social Context

Part 3: Sustainable Corporations
- Defining the corporation as stakeholder-focused
- Spiral Dynamics in various contexts
- Organizational engagement in diverse workspaces
- International application of Spiral Dynamics


### 8 Defining the Sustainable Corporation From Stockholders to Stakeholders. The Corporate VMEME Struggle

**The Sustainable Corporation: From Stockholder to Stakeholder**

**The Corporate VMEME Struggle**:
- The corporation has come to symbolize everything that is wrong with capitalism
- Greed, power, and political influence are synonymous with the values of corporate America
- Disparities between the wealthy and working/middle classes have fueled discontent and the Occupy Wall Street movement
- Corporations continue to report record profits and high executive remuneration during economic downturns

**The Promised American Dream vs. Reality**:
- The promise of prosperity for the many has become exclusive to the very few
- Is this capitalism run amok in the hands of corporations with unlimited power and lost sense of social responsibility?
- The pervasive culture of only money matters has lulled corporate executives, CEOs, and board members into a comfortable zone where empathy for others is seen as an impossible emotion

**The Knowledge Economy and Corporate Adaptation**:
- Traditional ORANGE corporations are becoming increasingly protective and archaic in the face of the knowledge economy's embrace of innovation
- Natural monopolies focus on strengthening relationships with lawmakers to preserve their market dominance, rather than embracing technological advancements
- The motto for these industries is "secure political influence or die," rather than the market-driven "innovate or die" approach

**Traditional Corporations in a Changing World**:
- Traditional ORANGE corporations are not all the same - some operate effectively from an Orange perspective
- It would be a disservice to society if these businesses were run from lower or higher First-Tier systems


#### The Functional Seventh-Level CEO

**The Sustainable Corporation: Defining the Open System**

**Functional Misalignment**:
- Productive output is the driving force behind capitalism
- Large corporations abandoned their functional interests as primary purpose
- Pursuit of short-term gains led to financial crisis
- Long-term investment in research and development gave way to marketing strategies
- Satisfaction with work gave way to satisfaction with pay
- CEOs with technical/industry knowledge replaced by those with charisma and financial knowledge
- Quarterly financial results became primary drivers of corporate goals
- Short-term focus led to creative accounting schemes and stock option schemes

**Realigning Corporations**:
- Many ORANGE (traditional) corporations are having to relinquish the values of financial engineering
- Realigning with natural functions is a painful, time-consuming process
- Requires reflection on VMEME (values, meaning, emotions, and motivation) patterns of behavior that steered corporate actions.


#### The Evolution of Ownership

**Spiral Dynamics and Business Leadership**

**Factors Affecting Business Leadership:**
- Angry American electorate opposed to taxpayer bailouts
- Mistrust in Wall Street
- Knowledge economy creating technological advancements

**The Role of Corporations:**
- Historical criticism of corporate practices
- Evolution of ownership and management structures

**Early History:**
- Complete control by owners (Gilded Age)
- Labor protections and unionization
- Psychological possession through financial rewards

**Current Shift:**
- Knowledge economy redefining ownership
- Integration of physical, psychological, and functional ownership

**Impact on Ownership:**
- Shift from financial gains to functional alignment
- Engineers becoming financially rewarded for their contributions

**Management Science in the Future:**
- Integration of all types of possession for sustainable business model.


#### Apple

**Spiral Dynamics in Action: Efficient Style of Execution and Sustainable Corporations**

**Natural Design Principles**:
- Identify needs of life conditions through values systems
- Penetrates deepest layers to understand motivation of stakeholders
- Plugs them on a mother-board that serves a new superordinate goal: provide global leadership through sustainable practices

**Corporate Leadership Examples**:

**Starbucks**:
- Under CEO Jim Donald (2005-2008), focused on efficiency and cost-cutting in expansion strategy
- Diminished the appeal of Starbucks' experience as a coffeehouse
- Misalignment between highest priority on ORANGE system goals and intrinsic values that made Starbucks unique
- Chairman Howard Schultz took responsibility, reinstated as CEO, and realigned values to YELLOW sustainability practices
- Customers and shareholders responded positively, with increased profits and commitment to global sustainability

**Apple**:
- Founder Steve Jobs exhibited visionary leadership transcending ORANGE metrics
- Transformed multiple industries: music, movies, mobile phones, computing
- Functional alignment to provide beauty and simplicity in use
- Long-term vision and refinement through trial and error
- Founder CEOs have intrinsic motivation, long-term approach, and focus on optimal shareholder value maximization
- Differences in managerial characteristics impact organizational behavior and performance

**Functional Alignment vs. ORANGE Life Conditions**:
- Functionality differs from industry to industry
- Founder CEOs pursue a functional ethic beyond short-term pressures of Wall Street and investment community
- Fahlenbrach (2007) research found differences in firm valuation, investment behavior, and stock market performance between founder-CEO firms and successor-CEOs.

**Google's Approach to Innovation and Management: A YELLOW System**

**Background:**
- Google asked entities on the World Wide Web to identify themselves (Kells, 2013)
- Based on others' perceptions, entities were categorized
- Google adopted best practices from BLUE, ORANGE, and GREEN stages

**Management Styles:**
- Weaving of best practices: BLUE (accounting, rules), ORANGE (marketing, creativity), GREEN (freedom)
- Manages constant flux of three value systems effectively

**Workplace Culture:**
- Innovation pipeline: ideas compete and iterate internally
- Radical version of R&D with low-key feedback process

- Iterate into something better, sometimes beaten out by other innovations
- Reaches next stage of evolution: public release as beta.


##### Google's ORANGE model: Superior work environment fosters innovation and long-term growth through acquisitions.

**Google's ORANGE and GREEN Values in the Knowledge Economy**

**Google's Superiority over Traditional ORANGE**:
- Google's ORANGE is superior to traditional ORANGE in research and development
- Google's GREEN values are more muscular than previous expressions in knowledge economy companies

**Google's Corporate Campus as a University Environment**:
- Google's corporate campus replicates the GREEN life-conditions of a university
- This makes the work environment a very conducive place for learning, creativity, and sharing new ideas

**Management Philosophy at Google**:
- Management allows engineers and designers one day out of the workweek to work on whatever projects they want
- This is reflected in a management philosophy that believes in allowing small groups with similar interests, motivations, and complementary talents to work on projects and see them to successful conclusion

**Google's Acquisition Model**:
- Google takes the ORANGE model to the next stage by adding a natural and systemic approach to its acquisition model
- This approach benefits all stakeholders in the long term, as it aligns the talents of the brightest engineers and designers with a proven business model while challenging their creativity and know-how
- This model is functionally sustainable and grows stakeholder value by increasing the size of the "brain bank"

**Spiral Dynamics in Action**:
- The pursuit of mergers and acquisitions at Google is not to increase short-term stockholder value, but to retain its competitive edge and create a continuously evolving and growing system
- This model transforms the workplace and monetization of talent in the knowledge economy into an open system in perpetuity.


##### Google's unbiased search engine: Objective answers from multiple sources

**Google's Search Engine Approach**
- Users of internet report back to Google about themselves, forming a wide model of life conditions
- Google believes humans are best judge of good web pages; avoids manipulation by human input
- Places more weight on number of other websites linking to a particular page than on subjective inclusion based on random hits
- Seeks objective responses from multiple sources to determine accurate reflection of life conditions
- Transparency without biases is key for making systemic decisions

**Google vs. Facebook IPOs and Wealth Distribution**
- Google stock up 900% since initial public offering, creating millionaires and billionaires
- Facebook share price down 45%, leaving disappointed investors
- Google creates disruption, with potential to redefine industries through investment arm (Google Ventures)
- Early stages of evolution for venture capital; Google's approach contrasts with overvalued, biased Facebook IPO.

##### Contrast of Orange and Green value systems in business: Conscious Capitalism and Whole Foods' balanced approach.

**ORANGE vs. GREEN Value Systems**

**Background:**
- Two distinct sets of stakeholders in modern business: ORANGE (profit-oriented) and GREEN (eco-consciousness)
- Conflicting values, with ORANGE focusing on self-interest and profit, while GREEN prioritizes the health of people and planet.

**ORANGE Value System:**
- Primary client: stockholder
- Secondary attention to other stakeholders but not a focus
- Rejects eco-consciousness as unprofitable

**GREEN Value System:**
- Belief in highest levels of human consciousness
- Rejection of profit pursuit
- Perceives Whole Foods' approach to solutions as greedy due to profit motive.

**The Problem:**
- Difficulty in getting both value systems to agree and coexist
- GREEN views ORANGE as taxing Earth's resources, ORANGE sees GREEN as irrelevant to business success.

**Conscious Capitalism by John Mackey:**
- Proposed solution for integrating ORANGE and GREEN values
- Shift from self-interest to public good as purpose of capitalism
- Balance between happiness of customers, team members, stockholders, suppliers, community, and environment is primary focus.

**Key Features of Conscious Capitalism:**
1. Purpose: public good instead of self-interest
2. People, passion, purpose, profit, and planet are all essential components
3. Interdependence acknowledged as highest value
4. Growth within the context of the public good
5. Flexible compensation system to reduce resentment and foster healthy competition
6. Transparency in executive compensation
7. Cap on executive compensation at 19 times average employee pay
8. Unprecedented stock option offering to non-executive employees (93%) compared to industry average (25%).

**Mackey's Leadership and Philosophy:**
- Owns less than 1% of Whole Foods' outstanding stock, receives an annual salary of $1.6 million
- Believes transparency in compensation reduces resentment and creates adaptive, self-organizing workplace.


#### Conclusion

**Spiral Dynamics in Action: Conscious Capitalism**

**Conscious Capitalism**:
- Articulated by Mackey in 2006 as a new breed of business leadership
- Integrates consciousness and capitalism
- Attracts executive leaders from successful corporations like Southwest Airlines and Nordstrom
- Aims to change life conditions by encouraging different thinking and action

**The Corporation of the Future**:
- Corporate governance may still be known as the "Second Tier"
- Criticism of corporate practices may persist even with executive compensation changes
- Companies like Whole Foods are an exception, using a "disruptive path of the knowledge economy" approach
- The path to Second-Tier emergence is long and arduous, requiring evolution in how we view ourselves and our environment

**Functionality in Conscious Capitalism**:
- Informed by different metrics than other Second-Tier models
- Stakeholders are treated as holistically interdependent, leading to a more conscious set of values
- The planet is viewed as the ultimate beneficiary of economic activity, aligning values with different motivations
- Life is seen as an interdependent mesh, with human survival on equal footing with economic interests

**Valuesystem Perspective**:
- The Conscious Capital model's functionality is informed by a different set of metrics than other Second-Tier models
- When all stakeholders are treated as holistically interdependent, a more conscious set of values emerges
- This creates an "interwoven web" that regards the planet as one ecosystem, with distributed innovation representative of the Eighth-Level TURQUOISE valuesystem.

**Integration of Efforts:**
- Spiral Dynamic codes play out in different parts of society
- A Second-Tier way to integrate diverse efforts into a functional, integrated flow.


#### The Framework Applied

**The Challenges Facing Organized Religion**

**Sustainable Ministry Models**:
- New churches often attract new people faster than existing congregations
- Sustainable ministry models need to have the capability to raise funds while doing their vitality work
- The "soul of the church" is what can be replicated and spread business-wise

**Changing Conditions Facing Religion**:
- Rising levels of consciousness internationally
- Changing worldviews of society at large
- These changes have forever changed the face of Christianity

**Adapting to New Life Conditions**:
- Beth Ann Estock and Paul Nixon (2016) assist churches in adapting to new life conditions
- They adapted a specific framework that explained the dynamics described, anchored in the work of Graves and Spiral Dynamics (Beck and Cowan 1996)


#### Why are Millennials so Hard to Deal With

**Spiral Dynamics:**
* Comprehensive model of human and cultural development based on four decades of research
* Acknowledges that human nature changes as conditions change, forging new systems to emerge
* People adapt their psychology and rules for living to fit new conditions
* Old systems can be transcended to include the new
* Anticipates future value structures (VMEMEs)

**Beth Ann and Paul:**
* Adapted Spiral Dynamics as underlying methodology
* Identified various religious organizing patterns or structures: community center, mission base camp, gallivanting fortress of defiance, tabernacle, cathedral, spiritual theme park
* Religious domination can be organized differently in different contexts

**Millennials:**
* Introduced the concept of generational theory by Neil Howe and William Strauss
* Cohort born between 1982 and 2004
* Characterized as explorers, seeking knowledge and understanding
* Exist without skin color, nationality, or religious bias
* Often labeled criminals for their actions.

**Hacker Manifesto:**
* Describes the world of the electron and switch, beauty of the baud
* Criticizes profiteering gluttons who run things
* Claims to make use of existing services without payment or judgment
* Seeks knowledge and understanding
* Exists beyond skin color, nationality, religious bias.

### 10 Organizational Engagement in Diverse Workspaces International Application of Spiral Dynamics

Chapter 9: Spiral Dynamics in Action - Strategies of New King's Horses, Men and Women

In this chapter, various applications of the MeshWORKS approach are demonstrated across practices, industries, countries, and societies. Figure 9.9 shows that weaving together different VMEMEtic codes necessitates second-tier leadership awareness, a perspective, and alignment around superior goals to unleash system performance. The upcoming Part on Spiral Dynamics PLUS will present decision-making and leadership support systems, including Adizes' VSM and CAPI (abbreviations in Figure 3.2).


#### Introduction. Trompenaars

**Introduction:**
- Author aims to introduce various approaches to understanding national culture, focusing on Spiral Dynamics theory
- Understanding how these thinking systems are represented in organizations can aid organizational change and development consultants
- Application of The Benchmark of Engagement (BeQ) is discussed

**Multi-cultural Approaches:**
1. **Geert Hofstede**:
   - Introduces dimensions that differ between countries: Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-term Orientation
   - Understanding national culture provides context to engagement dynamics within an organization
2. **Globe Studies:**
   - Expanded on Hofstede's work
   - Considers the following dimensions: Performance orientation, Assertiveness, Future orientation, Rewards for Fairness, Humane orientation, Institutional collectivism, In-group collectivism, and Gender equality
3. **Spiral Dynamics**:
   - Not explicitly mentioned in text but aligned with Hofstede's theories

**Theoretical Building Blocks:**
- Integrated into grounded theory research conducted by Viljoen-Terblanche (2008)
- Ensures consideration of different worldviews and thinking structures of employees from an ethnographic perspective throughout the research process.

**Hofstede Dimensions:**
| Dimension | Description |
|---|---|
| Power distance | Degree to which people view inequality as normal |
| Individualism | Degree to which society reinforces individual vs collective achievement and interpersonal relationships |
| Masculinity | Extent to which culture is conducive to dominance, assertiveness, and acquisition of things versus a culture conducive to people, feelings, and quality of life |
| Uncertainty avoidance | Degree to which people prefer structured over unstructured solutions |
| Long-term orientation | Degree to which there is a future orientation vs short-termism |

**Globe Studies Dimensions:**
| Dimension | Description |
|---|---|
| Performance orientation | Degree to which society encourages high standards of performance and rewards innovation and improvement |
| Assertiveness | Degree to which individuals are assertive, tough, dominant, and aggressive in social relationships |
| Future orientation | Extent to which members believe their actions will influence their future |
| Rewards for fairness, tolerance, altruism, kindness, and caring to others |
| Humane orientation | Degree to which a collective encourages and rewards individuals for being fair, tolerant, altruistic, kind, and caring to others |
| Institutional collectivism | Extent to which society's organizational and institutional norms and practices encourage collective action and the distribution of resources |
| In-group or individual collectivism | Degree to which individuals express pride, loyalty, and cohesiveness in their organizations and families |
| Gender equality | Minimizes gender inequality within the collective |


#### Spiral Dynamics

**Spiral Dynamics and Organizational Engagement**

**Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner Dimensions**:
- **Universalism vs. Particularism**: Importance of rules vs. relationships
- **Individualism vs. Communitarianism**: Function as individual or group
- **Specific vs. Diffuse**: Separation between private and working life
- **Neutral vs. Affective**: Emotion display
- **Achievement vs. Ascription**: Status proof vs. given status
- **Past–sequential vs. Future–synchronic**: Focus on one task at a time or multiple tasks
- **Internal vs. External**: Control over environment

**Spiral Dynamics Systems and Archetypes**:
1. **A-N "BAND" (individualistic)**: Herd behavior, strong members protect weaker ones
2. **B-O "TRIBE" (Collectivistic)**: Circular clan, rigid preservation of ways and culture
3. **C-P "EMPIRE" (Individualistic)**: Power-oriented, strongest survive best
4. **D-Q "PASSIVE HIERARCHY" (Collectivistic)**: Rigid rules for structure and rank
5. **E-R "ACTIVE HIERARCHY" (Individualistic)**: Bureaucratic and status-oriented
6. **F-S "SOCIAL NETWORK" (Collectivistic)**: Organization of equals for mutual benefit
7. **G-T "FUNCTIONAL FLOW" (Integral)**: Structure based on task at hand, project-centered leadership

**Importance of Spiral Dynamics Theory**:
- Valuable in understanding over-cultural dynamics in organizations
- Helps interpret business intelligence results, such as engagement studies


#### Doing Business in East Africa Tanzania

        - Only 28% engaged internationally, 20% in emerging economies
        - ROI on investment in human capital not optimized
        - Drivers for engagement differ for different human codes
- **Beige Codes**: Engage over a very short time for survival purposes
- **Purple Codes**: Engage to serve the needs of their family and community
- **Red Codes**: Engage if they feel they may win and gain power
- **Blue Codes**: Engage if rules are followed, organization is ethical, and there are long-term incentives
- **Orange People**: Engage if they view it as a vehicle to optimize the system
- **Green Codes**: Engage if there is a growth dynamic and inclusivity
- **Yellow Second-Tier Codes**: Engage if still in the organization and allowed to optimize the systemic whole

## PART 4 Spiral Dynamics PLUS

Part 4: Enhancing Spiral Dynamics with rSpiral Technologies.

This section focuses on extending and improving Spiral Dynamics through rSpiral techniques.

(Note: Due to the context, I cannot provide a concise summary as the provided text does not directly state what is being summarized.)


### 11 Spiral Dynamics PLUS Supplementary Technologies. Adizes

**SpiralDynamicsPLUS Supplementary Technologies**

**Introduction**:
- Complementary technologies to Humanity's Master Code
- YELLOW and TURQUOISE codes: "being" systems
  - **YELLOW code**: chaotic organism, forged by differences and change
  - **TURQUOISE code**: elegant, balanced system of interlocking forces
- New codes formed as new life conditions emerge
- Humanity faces more challenging and dangerous life conditions than ever before
  - "Everything from shaping natural habitats to gene splicing to using science in various ways to alter the human experience"
  - **Beck**: "As a species, we never had this capacity before."
- Nuclear weaponry development under RED code control poses a threat to global peace
  - Red has no Blue influence, discipline, and accountability
  - Short time frame and power

**Supporting Technologies**:
- Presented for use in the intervention phase of a transformational process


#### Adizes and Spiral. Adizes Components. The Adizes Method

**Spiral Dynamics and Adizes Methodology**

**Integration between Spiral Dynamics and Adizes**:
- Close alignment between Beck's natural design views and Adizes methodology
- Formed a symbiotic relationship, leading to co-facilitation of PhD programs and integration of SD into Adizes PhD curriculum

**Adizes Components**:
- Model: Human-inspired model of organizations
- Method: Treating organizations as living beings
- Ethics: Selznick's (2008) humanistic ethics
- Language: Organicist approach to understanding organizations

**Organizations as Organicism**:
- Root metaphor of a living organism
- Sees entities as whole, integrated gestalt vision
- Organizations have life cycles with predicted characteristics
- Control increases over time, leading to internal focus and detriment of flexibility

**Adizes Corporate Life Cycle**:
- Organizations go through growing and aging stages
- External focus in infancy and courtship, internal focus in adolescence and bureaucracy
- Key value is integration to function short and long term
- Four basic functions: Produce, Administer, Innovate, Integrate

**Adizes Approach to Internal Conflict**:
- Four sources of internal conflict: Different managerial styles (PAEI), different interests (CAPI), different perceptions, and different values (Spiral Dynamics)
- PAEI shift over the organization's life cycle
- CAPI: Cooperation between people with Authority, Power, and Influence
- Need for complementary teams to manage change and internal conflicts


#### Conclusion

**The Adizes Method**

**Focus**:
- Focuses on form, not content
- Consensus on procedures creates an environment for resolving conflicts
- Structured process provides the form for developing knowledge and wisdom

**Adizes Basic Equation (ABE)**:
- "Missions should be reflected in Structure; both should be reflected in Information Systems, and all three should be reflected in the Rewards System"
- The four sub-systems should be integrated through alignment

**Continuous Change**:
- The ABE components rarely change in synchrony, causing disintegration
- Disintegration is the source of all problems

**The Adizes Method Ethics**:
- Ethics involves working for an organization's present and future welfare, not just individual interests (even if the owners)
- Organizations are seen as living organisms, with integration being more important than elimination of diversity
- All problems are manifestations of a lack of integration; seek to immediately address this issue when a problem arises.


#### Simple Vital Signs and Vital Signs Monitors VSMs

**Spiral Dynamics in Action**

**Point of Disintegration**:
- Insights from Spiral Dynamics can be beneficial at this stage
- All other Adizes values (Respect, Trust, Tolerance, Patience) support integration
- Integration is crucial for organic entities as it maintains internal and physical integrity
- Different value systems hold different views on respect, trust, tolerance, and patience
- Organizational integration or inclusivity requires bringing together different "worlds" into an integral tapestry
- When facing conflict between personal convictions and professional ethics, favor the ethics of one's role
- The issue is not just whose ethics should prevail, but the true ethics for the organization or profession
- New ways of looking at the world require new languages to construct a new vision not previously seen

**Language and Communication**:
- A new vocabulary is a tool for constructing a new vision that has not been seen before
- Language permits collective formulation of facts and interpretation of the world
- A common language facilitates communication, understanding, and the achievement of change
- The language of Spiral Dynamics has different value systems with varying body language positions

**Conclusion**:
- The four Adizes components arise from the organicism root metaphor, which is synthetic and integrative
- Understanding Adizes requires recognizing that all components are based on the humanism root metaphor and the key value of integration
- Simple Vital Signs and Vital Signs Monitors (VSMs) can help organizations understand their current culture and direction
- Vital signs can be captured manually through surveys or automated, and should inform about life conditions and the response of cultures
- Understand your superordinate goal and how your organization relates to it, not just focusing on specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)


#### Assimilation Contrast Effect VACE. Introduction. Application

**Spiral Dynamics: Assimilation and Contrast Effect**

**Assimilation-Contrast Effect (ACE)**
- Human mind adopts views or opinions and integrates information to support them
- Constructivist nature results in assimilation contrast effect
- Power of narratives in cementing beliefs (Rosenbaum, 2017)

**Assimilation:**
- Similar/close characteristics lead to assimilation
- Group cohesion forms through involvement in activities and development of group identity
- Prejudice develops between groups initially manifested verbally, then directly (Sherif)

**Contrast:**
- Extreme context stimuli increase propensity for contrast effects
- Comparison of own opinions to others for self definition (Festinger's social comparison theory)

**Robbers Cave Experiment:**
- Study on group conflict and prejudice between two groups
- Initially, groups formed cohesion through involvement in activities and developing group identity
- Prejudice developed between the groups verbally at first, then directly
- Forcing groups together to reach common goals reduced tension (superordinate goals)

**Application of Assimilation-Contrast Effect:**
- Beck applied VACE effect in South Africa during Apartheid and Palestine/Israel conflicts
- Assimilation: Deny or ignore differences, pull other positions into acceptance zone
- Contrast: Displace other contrasting positions, push them away further than they actually are

**Spectrums of Beliefs and Actions:**
- Six degrees of intensity for various beliefs and actions (Flamethrowers to True Believers)
- Without a superordinate goal, fundamentalism, polarization, and conflict will form
- Integration of different parts and sections is essential for healthy functional environment (MeshWORKS)


#### Value Engineering

**Mesh Works and Mesh Weavers**
- **Mesh Works**: a way to uncover basic value system codes across different cultures
- **Vital Signs Monitor (VSM)**: critical on the collective level for creating a Mesh
- Understanding unique dynamics of each entity, as well as synergistic impact when brought into relationships
- Practicality and application at the "coal-face" or "grass roots" level

**Value Engineering Applied - Spiral Dynamics Approach**
- **Value Management**: essential part of operational processes in organizations since 1980s
- Continuous improvement through quality circles, making jobsites enjoyable and challenging
- Demonstrating full human potential capacity

**Challenges in South Africa**
- Illiteracy rate among adult labor force: 50%
- Differences in thinking systems between Japan and South Africa

**Approach for Inclusivity: Value Circles**
- Structured shared decision-making process to connect different thinking systems
- Human mandalas, where analogue and digital thinking interplay to achieve common understanding and inclusivity.

**Value Engineering Applied with Spiral Dynamics Integration:**
- Presented in this chapter
- Various cases of successful application presented as short cases.


#### A Typical Value Circle Process

**Spiral Dynamics in Action: Value Engineering**

**Background:**
- First mentioned at Virginia Gold Mine in South Africa, 1963
- Influenced by Edward de Bono, Edwards Deming, Larry Miles, and General Electric Corporation
- Established National Value Centre in 1986 with Beck, van Heerden, and Laubscher as principals

**Value Engineering and Value Circles:**
- Address 85% of production problems caused by management misattribution
- South African context: blame often placed on workers; lack of respect or engagement leads to disengagement and lower success rates
- Quality circles as an alternative to dehumanizing labor division
- Employees identified, analyzed, and solved work-related problems through training in various techniques like fishbone diagrams, Pareto charts, process mapping, etc.

**Spiral Dynamics Philosophy:**
- Balance between quality, quantity, and cost for value creation
- Stakeholders have specific expectations from systems; input -> transformation -> output
- Support from HR and Finance during the transformation phase
- Co-creation of improvements through inclusivity
- Personal growth in individuals facilitated
- Shift from right-brained to left-brained thinking encouraged for harvesting latent brainpower

**Consultant Role:**
- Alternates analogue (intuitive, emotional) and digital (rational, logical) thinking activities
- Understanding of PURPLE and RED thinking systems essential during the process
- Employees who notice or complain about difficulties should be involved in solving dilemmas for effective implementation.


#### Different Value Management Cases

**Spiral Dynamics in Action: Process for Addressing Complex Challenges**

**People Mandala Process (Laubscher, 2015a)**
- **Objective**: What is the problem? What needs to be discussed?
- **Information/Function**: What is happening at the moment? Evaluate which function is the most important?
- **Pareto Principle**: Concentrate on the top 20%
- **Creativity**: What else can we do? (No judgment allowed at this point)
- **Evaluation/Development**: Which ideas can we combine to make a good plan? What will it cost?
- **Five-star rating**: Which ideas can receive a 5-star rating? Which ideas receive 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 stars?
- **Report/Plan**: Starratings, Feedback/Adjustment, Solution proposed, Rejected reason for decision
- **Responsibility**: Reportback (stipulate the deadline)
- **Action taken**: Aleader, facilitator or organizational development practitioner should act as a catalyst.

**Typical Value Circle Process**
- Outcome of process becomes input for report-back meetings.

**Health Care Issues**
- Increased complexity of care, antimicrobial resistant organisms, and budget constraints (Flott et al., 2017)
- Call for concerted and effective ways to improve healthcare outcomes (Porter, 2006)
- Hospitals are complicated, highly dynamic environments where systems failure causes patient harm and erodes value (Vincent, 2006)
- South Africa: nurse shortages, particularly in higher skill categories, and insatiable demand or waiting list volumes
- Compensatory tactics: supplementing nursing teams with lower-level health care workers or bridging lower skill categories to higher levels
- Nurse management tends to follow hierarchical, strong BLUE-driven policy and top-down governance of diverse, multicultural and often Code PURPLE or Code RED teams
- Large case volume and outcomes measures add pressure on front-line nursing and management staff, increasingly unable to relate to one another
- Overwhelmed front-line staff can be seen as apathetic by management, who turn to BLUE approaches such as audit activity, further eroding team cohesion
- Improvement cycles, as explained by Deming (Langley, 2009), coupled with appreciation and respect for different thinking patterns within the group have achieved breakthroughs in these teams.
- Focusing on inclusive engagement: nursing teams and management collectively analyze problems and design solutions, facilitating a dialogue around their shared purpose.


##### Collaborative problem-solving through teamwork and ball games in conflict resolution.

**Problem Analysis and Improvement Process**
- Problems analyzed using generic tools like process and systems analysis as a team
- Focus is non-punitive, focused on understanding why the care system failed
- Team tests changes in actual work environment, collectively studying outcomes
- Management adopts a facilitative role, focusing on consultation and communication
- Scientific (left-brain) aspects of improvement, such as problem analysis and measurement, are balanced with right-brain artofimprovement generation of testable ideas

**Collective Improvement Culture**
- Respectful consideration for multiple cultures within the system allows evolution of a new "Just Culture" fundamental to patient safety improvement
- Not seeking to blame individuals, but appreciating the entire system and humans within it

**Second-Tier Thinking and Human Energy**
- Unleashes gifts from different codes to perform, resulting in increased patient care indices and productivity

**Taxi Violence in Greater Pretoria Metropolitan Council (GPMC)**
- Huge problem with taxi conflict in Pretoria, including killing and setting each other's vehicles on fire
- Andrew Barker facilitated a meeting between taxi associations, public, and provincial government authorities to develop an implementable plan for a violence-free taxi industry within one year
- Foreign business phrases were unrelatable to people in the taxi industry
- Consultants used sports balls to defuse the threatening conflict situation
- Explained that the balls represented games with rules, regulations, and punishments for non-compliance, but also excitement and enjoyment.


##### Workshop applies soccer game framework to improve taxi industry and mine worker living conditions.

**Taxi Industry as Soccer Game**

**Laubscher's Proposal**:
- Frame conflict situation through soccer game framework
- Strict rules, everyone understands the game
- Every participant has a role to play
- If taxi industry was a soccer team, violence could be eliminated
- Metaphor of soccer creates understanding for complexity of the industry

**Workshop Process**:
1. Identify the ball (focus on taxis as focus)
2. What is the game? (Winning, survival)
3. Who are the players? (Taxi owners)
4. How do you learn the game? (By playing, having a vehicle and using it)
5. Concepts and ideas of soccer equated with business in taxi industry
6. Recommendations for actions and activities to achieve goal
7. Determine roles everyone should fulfill and deadline for implementation
8. Successful workshop, report submitted to GPMC
9. Department of Transport requested a copy of the report
10. Entire taxi industry structure in Pretoria structured based on workshop outcomes

**Hostel Improvements at Western Deep Levels Gold Mine**:
- 14 mineworkers attended inclusive workshop
- Opportunity for more participants to be chosen from 3000-4000 low-level employees
- Group granted permission to improve anything in the miners’ hostel


##### Miners improve bed design through creative problem solving in hostel living conditions.

**Identified Problems at the Hostel:**
- **No place to put a Bible (or any other book) when going to bed**: The space under the bed was shared by two occupants, leaving no room for personal belongings like Bibles or books.
- **Lack of ashtray**: If someone was a smoker, there was no place to put an ashtray near the bed.
- **Issue with space under the bed**: Spaces under the beds were used to store various items, including wet boots, odd ends, and leftover food. This area was also subject to other people touching or interfering with personal belongings.

**Attempts to Address Identified Problems:**
- **Ashtray and Bible holder**: Suggestion to weld a metal ring to the head of the bed, allowing for an ashtray and Bible/book holder to be inserted.
- **Safe and dry space for wet boots and jackets**: Building enclosures around the space under the bed to accommodate wet boots and jackets in a safe and dry area for drying. This was necessary because miners' boots had to be washed but remained wet, leading to issues with theft when placed on wooden poles to dry overnight.

**Shift from Blue to Purple Approach:**
- The previous "blue code of management" was unsuccessful and unsustainable.
- A "purple approach" was required to address the needs of the miners effectively.

**Prototype Bed Design:**
- Miners designed a prototype bed that solved the identified problems, such as providing space for wet boots, jackets, Bibles/books, and an ashtray.
- The prototype was presented to the mine manager, who offered to have a boilermaker assist in creating similar beds for all miners. However, the miners built the prototype without external help.
- The completed prototype bed was displayed outside the hostel manager's office and attracted interest from a company that supplied mines with equipment. They requested to borrow the prototype to create beds for the mine.

**Distribution of New Beds:**
- The new beds were delivered directly to the hostel instead of the mine stores, where they remained on the veranda due to senior management being absent when they arrived.
- Watchmen were asked to guard the new beds until the next morning when the hostel manager would distribute them fairly. However, all the old, dilapidated beds were missing from the veranda by morning, indicating that they had been stolen during the night.


#### Benefits of Value Circles. Carkhuffs  Seven Skills. The Theory

**Spiral Dynamics: Value Circles and Carkhuff's Seven Skills**

**Value Circles:**
- Open environment for unrestricted communication at all levels
- Fully utilize abilities and skills of human resources
- Increase staff motivation, involvement, and engagement
- Decision making becomes more structured and sustainable
- Creative cost-effective decisions can be made at all levels
- Tangible benefits: increased production, decreased staff turnover, permanent shift in consciousness

**Benefits:**
- Open environment for unrestricted communication
- Utilize abilities and skills of all employees
- Hear the voice of employees and strengthen inclusivity
- Decision making becomes more structured and sustainable
- Increase in creativity, production, and engagement
- Decrease in staff turnover
- Permanent shift in consciousness for participants

**Carkhuff's Seven Skills:**

**Initiative Dimensions:**
- **Empathy**: Understand another person's state or point of view
  - Helper believes "you are in my skin"
  - Joining the other's experience through empathy
- **Respect**: Caring for someone
  - Responding in a way that conveys caring and belief in their capacity to improve

**Self-Disclosure Dimensions:**
- **Genuineness**: Being real, coming into direct personal encounter with the Helpee
  - Reporting internal states authentically

**Responsive Dimensions:**
- **Confrontation**: Telling it like it is, pointing out incongruencies between worlds, feelings, and actions
  - Invitation to examine behavior and change if necessary
- **Immediacy**: Discussing what's happening now with the Helpee
  - Ability to discuss where the Helper stands in relation to the Helpee.


#### The Application

**Carkhuff's Interpersonal Interactions Model**

**Empathy (Dimension 1)**
- Defined as functional, where helper and helped cannot be separated
- Levels: Empathic understanding of listener/helper
  - Level 1: Not indicative of sensitivity to feelings of others
  - Level 5: Clear visibility or eventual acknowledgement of feelings of the helped
- Middle levels serve as measure of moderate awareness, not fully comprehending the helped

**Respect (Dimension 2)**
- Relates to verbal and non-verbal aspects of communication
- Helper exudes positive composure towards the helped, expresses concern for their emotions
- Levels: Little or no respect for the helped (Level 1) to deep concern and feeling for their plight (Levels 4-5)

**Genuineness (Dimension 3)**
- Person being "real" during an encounter, not hiding behind a facade
- Requires self-awareness, allowing the helped access to feelings and emotions experienced
- Levels: Defensiveness on helper's part (Level 1), destructive or hurtful interaction, to deeper ease of communication and mutual sharing (higher levels)

**Self-disclosure (Skill 4)**
- Spontaneous honesty between parties involved
- More is shared, leading to deeper understanding
- Levels: Helper shares little or nothing of self (Level 1), superficial honesty, to trust and sharing deep-rooted experiences (Level 5)

**Concreteness (Skill 5)**
- Eliminating vague or ambiguous commentary; focusing on specifics and correctness
- Levels: No effort made to guide interaction towards relevant communication (Level 1), to proactive facilitation of direct expression of feelings and information (Level 5)

**Confrontation (Skill 6)**
- Encourages exploration of seemingly incongruent elements
- Helper ideally discusses discrepancies and incongruences calmly without prejudice
- Levels: Disengaged from the helped at initial stages, with judgment or stereotyping (lower levels), to identification and discussion of tensions in a calm manner (higher levels)

**Immediacy (Skill 7)**
- Deals with real-time sensing of changes during an interaction
- Helper questions why subtle changes occur and discusses them openly and honestly
- Levels: Dismissive attitude towards nuances (Level 1), tentative approach to discussing changes, to open and honest discussion of any changes in the interaction (higher levels)

**Application:**
Carkhuff's model maintains the integrity of interpersonal interactions by describing them in two phases: initial engagement and appropriate responses. The dimensions are based on empathic understanding. The dimensional model provides a practical perspective that can be combined with other theories influencing people in different states. Beck integrated Carkhuff's Seven Skills into his Spiral Dynamics practice, including cases such as conflict resolution between police and citizens.


#### The Seven Steps of Functional Design. Debate  Competitive to Convince Others. Dialogue  Talking Together Using Anecdotes and Personal Life Experiences. Deliberation  Trying to Understand and Beginning to Create a Solution. Design

**Seven Steps of Functional Design by Beck and Johns (2017)**

**Debate - Competitive, to Convince Others:**
- People hold one view and strongly argue it by finding flaws in others' arguments.
- Polarizes thesis and antithesis of the argument for improvement or weakness assessment.
- Goal: beat opponent (FS or GREEN codes).

**Dialogue - Talking Together Using Anecdotes and Personal Life Experiences:**
- Process generating collective learning, shared meaning, and commitment for implementation.
- Seek understanding between people, not against each other.
- Exploring the problematic nature of day-to-day relationships and communications (Bohm, 1998).
- Can be time-consuming; follow a well-planned, facilitated manner through seven steps.

**Deliberation - Trying to Understand and Beginning to Create a Solution:**
- Identification of areas of agreement during dialogue.
- Explore various points raised for deep understanding (seek meaningful change).
- Deliberation can halt systemic change as solutions need to be designed.

**Diagnosis - Different Hypotheses Are Posed:**
- After the first three steps, multiple perspectives on a problem emerge.
- Group creates hypotheses about the issue at hand based on collective understanding.


#### Dismissing  Forms of Dismissing the Status Quo by Off-loading. Deployment. The Impact of Language

**Spiral Dynamics + Supplementary Concepts**

**Functional Design:**
- Sixth Step: Dismissing the Status Quo
  * Disengage: Keep what is useful
  * Destroy: Get rid of outdated systems
  * Decommission: Honor and celebrate new systems
- Deployment: Implementing proposed solutions
  * Glitches may be uncovered during this step

### 12 What Do You Do with Spiral Dynamics. A Few Examples and Illustrations of the Use of Spiral Dynamics

**Spiral Dynamics (SD): A Comprehensive Approach to Understanding Complex Systems**

**Overview**:
- Spiral Dynamics is a systemic framework for addressing "big picture" perspectives and holistic views in executive leadership thinking
- Provides a mechanism and methodology for examining macro and micro issues simultaneously
- Offers a practical, seamless change technology that aligns and connects all variables, stakeholders, cultures, subcultures, and interests within an organization

**Distinctiveness of Spiral Dynamics**:
- Not found in any applied literature, journals, bestseller books, academic programs, or consultant packages
- Stands alone as a comprehensive approach to understanding complex systems

**Addressing Practical Problems**:
- Offers a fresh human intelligence with carefully researched and field-tested thinking and problem resolution process
- Deals with the hidden psychological "DNA" codes at the heart and soul of organizations, businesses, governments, etc.
- Effectively merges, meshes, or integrates disparate entities into new, competitive, and skillfully aligned relationships

**Integration with Other Approaches**:
- Spiral Dynamics can fit all other perspectives, theories, gurus, models, concepts, packages, and "solutions" to the specific needs of various groups, functions, audiences, and cultures
- No other popularized executive/organizational/cultural/managerial/education model can make this claim.


#### Spiral Dynamics: Applications and illustrations in business, marketing, and industries.

**Spiral Dynamics Applications:**
* Banking sector:
  * Designed marketing briefing and strategy for a large downtown bank in Dallas
    - Profiled value systems of bank employees
    - Created a day-long marketing briefing tailored to those systems
    - Recommended follow-through activities to reinforce beliefs and attitudes
  * SeniorVP claimed our program increased new accounts by 63%
* South Africa banking group:
  * Designed financial packages, banking facilities, marketing strategies, and communication plans for various population segmentations
  * Resulted in the design and construction of neighborhood banks tailored to value systems and VMEMEs
  * Assigned bank managers based on congruence with employees and specific neighborhoods
* Major US airline:
  * Helped executives clearly define their strategy
  - Aligned all functions – selection, advertising, passenger relationships, management, marketing, and employee communication – to that strategy
  * Airline is now one of the most profitable in transportation, copied by many competitors
* US Army Corps of Engineers:
  * Explained how different pieces of property activated various VMEMEs
  * Helped the Corps best deal with those value priorities in land acquisition.


#### Applications of Spiral Dynamics in various industries, cultures, and societal transformations.

**Various Applications Across Industries**:
- Strategic/systemic planning, affirmative action and diversity, hostel management, motivation and communication, social change
- Developed a total societal transformation initiative and nation-building strategy for South Africa
- Facilitated large-scale transformational processes in the United Kingdom, Iceland, Netherlands, Palestine, Israel, and other countries
- Underlying theory for the successful transformation of the third-largest gold mining house in the world


#### Final Thoughts About VMEMEtic Codes

**Spiral Dynamics: Applications and Final Thoughts**

**Applications of Spiral Dynamics:**
- **Healthcare organization**: Enhancing patient care experience
- **Curriculum**: Part of PhD and master’s classes internationally in leadership and multi-culturalism
- **"The Crucible": Forging South Africa’s Future** (Beck & Linscott, 1991) - Bestseller during critical transformation period
- Programs underway at local community level, major banks, hospitals, international mining houses, youth rehabilitation, etc.
- First human dynamics model addressing societal issues, especially those experiencing high levels of turbulence and demands for social change
- Lord Andrew Stone's speech in the UK Parliamentary Debates (2016) referencing Don Beck’s work for regional reconciliation
- Integration of academic world and field application in Spiral Dynamics work by Beck and associates
- Equipping local practitioners, leaders, and employees to apply SD methodology for skills transfer and capacity building

**VMEMEtic Codes:**
- **Chords not notes**: Understanding human emergence, not frozen types or rigid quadrant models
- Center of gravity: BLUE (absolutistic, justice for all) WITH emerging ORANGE (individualistic, wants personal autonomy) based on current circumstances
- Systems in the basement: Value systems from history that can still be used and integrated if understood and transcended
- New conditions in the attic: New emerging systems as life conditions change

**Emergence vs. being static:**
- VMEMEtic change as life conditions shift, creating internal and external turmoil if not understood and allowed
- **Never stereotype**: Add "some" when using collective nouns (e.g., some females)

**Equation versus solution:**
- Equation examines multiple variables in changes of different variations
- Spiral Dynamics as a formula: A way to find uniqueness, not a system for finding a one-size-fits-all solution
- BarCode indicates: Who are the people? What are they doing? What needs to be done? (A solution for, not THE solution)
- Inclusion and transcendence of old values systems like superpowers in different situations
- Graves (1974): The best leader is the one where internal code can deal most effectively with external changes in life conditions.


#### Reflecting on the Developing Journey of Spiral Dynamics and the Master Code

**Spiral Dynamics: Reflecting on the Developing Journey of Spiral Dynamics and the Master Code**

**Background:**
- Clare W. Graves' foundational contribution to adult human development theory led to creation of Spiral Dynamics
- Graves' groundbreaking work provided basis for this book (Chapters 3 & 4)
- Spiral Dynamics and Master Code application value resulted from collaboration between Don E. Beck and Cowan

**Collaboration and Partnership:**
- 29-year friendship and partnership
- Original Spiral Dynamics book creation
- Application of theory in various spaces
- Integration of NLP into approach

**Endorsements:**
- Travel partners witnessed phenomenal development and application value
- Personal appreciation for the value added to their lives

**Journey of Beck and Cowan:**
- Roads parted after 29 years
- Beck found resonance with Ken Wilber and integral psychology
- Focus on integral leaders, Second-Tier thinking to solve First-Tier problems

**Differences between Beck and Wilber:**
- Beck viewed Spiral as middle of 4Q/8L model, underpinning all other applications
- Wilber saw it as a one-way aspect in development of consciousness

**Spiral Dynamics in Action:**
- Jon Freeman's question: New shifts in consciousness facilitation and support (Reinventing Organizations)
- Graves' theory simplified presentation in "Teal Organizations" by Laloux
- Beck's concern over color scheme, oscillating rhythm value lost

**Communication and Debate:**
- Occasional email communication between Beck and Wilber
- Rumors of public debate challenge.


#### Insights Gained and Ideas Remembered

**Interview with Jessica Roemischer (2002)**

**Discussion on Spiral Dynamics and Evolution**
- Roemischer: The 21st century will see more change than the 20th century, with 20,000 years of progress expected
- Beck: Biological genetic systems may not have the capacity to handle such rapid change
- Multiple changes happening up and down the spiral simultaneously as people move through different layers
- Stress is necessary for evolution but not a guarantee of making significant progress

**The Importance of Memetic Systems**
- Old memetic systems are being questioned and found wanting
- The full realization of the Yellow meme, the first level of Second Tier, is years in the future
- This next memetic level must match or exceed the complexity of current Life Conditions
- Anticipate what will come next and transcend/include previous values

**Personal Reflection by Roemischer (2006)**
- Graves was right: The leap to Second Tier is "momentous" - a difference between inner conflict and profound inner resolution for all parts of oneself, all memes.
- It means dropping away of fear and being completely at home in the universe.
- Discovering that the whole spiral is necessary - what got us here and the humility required to continue the journey.


#### Where to from Now

**Recognizing Humanity's Never-Ending Quest: Spiral Dynamics**

**Insights from Spiral Dynamics**:
- Freedom from fear and irresolution leads to awe of human emergence and the cosmic order
- The Gravesian Seventh Code (integral, flow, and function) is the first human system beyond post-modernism
- This approach differentiates from other theories as it is post-post-modernistic and integral in nature

**Continued Work**:
- Thomas and Don continuing work on Vital Signs Monitor with artificial intelligence
- Rica's work on BEIGE and PURPLE with Loraine in Africa
- Teddy and Sergey attempting to influence Russian dynamics through Spiral Dynamics theory
- International inquiry on the Beauty of Beige, as well as other practitioners exploring Second Tier dynamics
- Possible first momentum leap from the North, reminding that "in the long run, the great gift to the world by Africa will be in the field of human relationships"
- Insights from the East emerged in the China case study

**Impact and Dedication**:
- Those associated with Beck and Graves will be impacted forever
- Understanding Spiral Dynamics is a journey that can be shared with loved ones
- Don Beck attempting to write a book that is relevant to today's life conditions at the age of 80.


#### Conclusion

**What Do You Do With Spiral Dynamics?**

**Humpty Dumpty and Human Nature**
- Humpty Dumpty metaphor used by Don Beck to represent humanity's "MasterCode"
- Collecting over 80 Humpty Dumpties from around the world
- Figure 12.5 shows Beck with an art piece of a adult Humpty Dumpty
- Suggests this is a new momentous leap for humanity, not just a traditional change

**The Momentous Leap**
- Clare Graves' concept of a "momentous leap" that will change society forever
- Partisan ideologies offer explanations, but they are in service to their beliefs about end times
- A beautiful time to be alive, or is it?

**Recognizing the Absurdity of Stereotypes**
- The stereotype of "white" as being associated with certain belief systems is false and irrelevant
- Black and white labels are becoming outdated as more people move into complex value systems (PURPLE, RED, BLUE, ORANGE, GREEN)
- Work with leaders in Paul Robeson High School: students feared going back to projects due to being accused of "acting white"

**The Gap Between the Haves and Have Nots**
- Beck concludes that humanity is facing hard truths and powerful choices ahead
- These choices will be political, religious, and educational, all predicated on the spiral
- Ignorance is worse than a little knowledge; being aware of Spiral Dynamics holds a versatile tool for wise use.
