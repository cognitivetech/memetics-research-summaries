# Memes In Digital Culture Limor Shifman (2013)

> **Taking “Gangnam Style” seriously: what Internet memes can tell us about digital culture.** In December 2012, the exuberant video “Gangnam Style” became the first YouTube clip to be viewed more than one billion times. Thousands of its viewers responded by creating and posting their own variations of the video—“Mitt Romney Style,” “NASA Johnson Style,” “Egyptian Style,” and many others. “Gangnam Style” (and its attendant parodies, imitations, and derivations) is one of the most famous examples of an Internet meme: a piece of digital content that spreads quickly around the web in various iterations and becomes a shared cultural experience. In this book, Limor Shifman investigates Internet memes and what they tell us about digital culture. Shifman discusses a series of well-known Internet memes—including “Leave Britney Alone,” the pepper-spraying cop, LOLCats, Scumbag Steve, and Occupy Wall Street's “We Are the 99 Percent.” She offers a novel definition of Internet memes: digital content units with common characteristics, created with awareness of each other, and circulated, imitated, and transformed via the Internet by many users. She differentiates memes from virals; analyzes what makes memes and virals successful; describes popular meme genres; discusses memes as new modes of political participation in democratic and nondemocratic regimes; and examines memes as agents of globalization. - [Memes in Digital Culture_Limor Shifman](https://www.amazon.com/Memes-Digital-Culture-Essential-Knowledge/dp/0262525437?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

- Video sparks creative user-generated content (parodies, remixes) from around the world
- Central attributes: user-created derivatives and intertextuality
- Term "Internet meme" commonly used to describe such phenomena

**The Meme Concept**:
- Coined by Richard Dawkins in 1976 to describe small units of culture that spread through imitation
- Academic debate, dismissal, but gaining popularity among Internet users
- Describes propagation of items like jokes, rumors, videos, and websites on the Internet

**Characteristics of Internet Memes**:

- Memes reflect social mindsets and shape public discourse
- User-driven imitation and remixing are valued practices in a "participatory culture"

**Memes as a Communication Perspective**:
- Coined by biologist, adopted across disciplines but ignored in communication
- Relevant to understanding digital media and the blurring boundaries between interpersonal and mass communication

**Issues with the Meme Concept**:
- Lack of clarity on the exact meaning of "meme"
- Competing terms used interchangeably (e.g., "viral")
- Limited studies on the creation and diffusion of Internet memes

**Book Overview**:
- Part 1: Surveys history, definition, and differentiation between Internet memes and virals.


### 2 A Telegraphic Biography of a Conceptual Troublemaker

**The Term "Meme"**
- Introduced by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976) as **cultural units of transmission**, analogous to genes
- Defined as **replicators that undergo variation, competition, selection, and retention**
- Examples include cultural artifacts like melodies, catchphrases, clothing fashions, and abstract beliefs
- Coadapted meme complexes (memeplexes) form groups of coadaptive memes that strengthen each other

**Background of the Term "Meme"**
- **Mneme**: Greek term for "something which is imitated", used by Ewald Hering in 1870 and Richard Semon in 1904
- Dawkins's use of the term "meme" was an accidental imitation of existing terminology

**Early Development of Memetics as a Research Program**
- Memetics emerged as an active research program in the late 1990s, drawing scientists from various fields
- Important works: Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel C. Dennett's contributions, Journal of Memetics (1997-2005), Susan Blackmore's The Meme Machine (1999)

**Controversies in Memetics**
- **Biological analogies**: Analogizing memes to viruses and genes. Criticism: overemphasis on biology, lack of focus on human agency
- **Who's the boss**: Debate between Susan Blackmore (people as hosts) vs. Rosaria Conte (people as actors). Importance for understanding Internet memes

**Popular Use of the Term "Meme"**
- Widely disputed in academia, enthusiastically adopted by Internet users
- Differences between academic and popular uses: focus on transitory fads vs. long-term successful memes, objects of analysis (abstract vs. observable)

**Bridging the Gap between Academic and Popular Uses of "Meme"**
- Memes reflect deep social and cultural structures, can be treated as modern folklore in which shared norms and values are constructed through cultural artifacts.


### 3 When Memes Go Digital

**Meme Propagation in Digital Era**

**Background:**
- Memes' popularity linked to Internet's unique features
- Three properties enhancing meme diffusion: longevity, fecundity, copy fidelity

**Attributes of Memes and Internet Culture:**
1. **Gradual propagation from individuals to society**: memes shape minds and behaviors on a macro level;
2. **Reproduction via copying and imitation**: people spread content as is or create their own versions;
3. **Diffusion through competition and selection**: fitness of memes impacts their propagation.

**Impact of Internet:**
- Express paths for meme diffusion: YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc.;
- Sharing as fundamental activity in digital sphere;
- Convergence of sharing as distribution and communication.

**Meme Repackaging Mechanisms:**
1. **Mimicry**: redoing or imitating content in various forms;
   - Impersonation: impracticing, emulating others;
   - Prevalence in Web 2.0 era;
   - Examples: "Charlie Bit My Finger";
2. **Remixing**: technology-based manipulation of memes;
   - User-friendly applications enable reworks;
   - Widespread practice among Internet users.

**Meme Fitness and Cultural Selection:**
- Memes vary in adaptability to sociocultural environments;
- Digital media allow tracing the spread and evolution of memes;
- Meta-information about competition and selection influences users' decisions.


#### Memes in contemporary culture: From Kilroy Was Here to hypermemetics and personal branding.

**Hypermemetic Logic and Internet Memes**

**Background:**
- Sharing, imitating, remixing memes are valued in digital culture
- Spread widely and swiftly with reach into various spheres of expression
- Dominant logic of participatory culture for digitally literate netizens

**Characteristics of Hypermemetic Memes:**
1. **Hyperreach**: Spreading further and wider than before
2. Pervasiveness in digital and non-digital expression
3. Evolution as a new vernacular language
4. Unexpected appearances, such as during marriage proposals
5. Multidimensional presence

**Comparison between Old and New Memes:**
1. Originated during World War II with "Kilroy Was Here" meme
2. Simple, easily reproduced messages
3. Appeared in public places ensuring wide dissemination
4. Open to interpretation, creating a sense of belonging to a community
5. Differences: visibility of variability and centrality of creator

**Hypermemetic Nature:**
1. Widespread presence as groups of texts and images
2. Memes are not just ephemeral but alive on the web
3. Focus on performative self in contemporary memes
4. Expression of uniqueness and connectivity through memes
5. Economic, social, and cultural logics of participation: to be explored further.


### 4 Defining Internet Memes

**Internet Memes: Defining the Concept**

**Background:**
- Core problem of memetics: defining the term "meme"
- Dawkins' initial definition ambiguous: unit of cultural transmission or imitation
- Disputes center on mind–body dichotomy, yielding three positions: mentalist driven, behavior driven, and inclusive

**Mentalist-driven Memetics:**
- Memes are ideas or pieces of information that reside in the brain
- Memes are "loaded" onto various vehicles for transmission
- Memes = abstract units of information vs. tangible expressions (phenotypes)

**Behavior-driven Memetics:**
- Memes are behaviors and artifacts rather than ideas
- Meme vehicle and meme are inseparable
- Memes studied as observable behaviors and practices

**Inclusive Memetic Approach:**
- Memes refer to any type of information that can be copied by imitation
- Includes ideas, brain structures, behaviors, texts, images, etc.
- Lacks analytical power due to broad definition

**Proposed Definition:**
- Internet memes as groups of content items sharing common characteristics in three dimensions:
  1. Content
  2. Form
  3. Stance (new concept)
- Memes are not single entities but a collection of related units with common characteristics

**Components of the Proposed Definition:**

**Content:**
- Ideas and ideologies conveyed by a specific text or image

**Form:**
- Physical incarnation of the message, including visual/audible dimensions and genre-related patterns

**Stance:**
- Ways in which addressers position themselves in relation to the text, its linguistic codes, addressees, and other potential speakers
- Participation structures: who is entitled to participate and how
- Keying: tone and style of communication
- Communicative functions: referential, emotive, conative, phatic, metalingual, poetic

**Application:**
- Demonstrated through analysis of "Leave Britney Alone," "It Gets Better," and the "Pepper-Spraying Cop" memes.


#### Analyzing the memetic transformation of "Leave Britney Alone" video, focusing on content, form, and parodic stance.

**"Leave Britney Alone" Video Analysis:**

**Content**:
- Ideas and ideologies conveyed in the video:
    - Facts about Britney Spears's life (e.g., children, divorce)
    - Castigation of people criticizing fallen celebrities
    - Conveying the message that being gay and effeminate is a legitimate practice

**Form**:
- Video layout features:
    - One talking head, filmed in close-up and in one-shot
    - White cloth background
- Repetition of certain phrases
- Raised voice pitch
- Tears
- Distraught hand gestures

**Stance**:
- Reminds the viewer that a gay, effeminate individual is openly expressing his opinion in the public sphere
- Keying: Extremely serious and ultra-emotional
- Primarily referential, conative, and emotive functions according to Jakobson's six communication functions
- Phatic function identified through Crocker's frequent feeds on YouTube and MySpace

**Derivatives Analysis**:
- Viewers imitated the video's form with high accuracy (one person in front of a white cloth, masculine or effeminate appearance, repetition of phrases)
- Radical changes in content and stance:
    - Parodic intentions towards Crocker's original message about being an overtly effeminate homosexual
    - Mockery of celebrities (e.g., "Leave Justin Bieber Alone", "Leave Rebecca Black Alone")
    - Abandonment of Crocker's overtly emotional performance in favor of a cynical and ironic stance.


#### Exploring the complexities of internet memes through video and image examples.

**Meme Analysis: "Leave Britney Alone" vs. "Pepper-Spraying Cop"**

**Irony in Internet Communication:**
- Speakers often use opposite meaning of words in videos
- Majority employ common ironic keying
- Imitation combines overt copying and reversing aspects of original event
- Powerful communication meme: ironic communication

**Meme Typology: Content, Form, and Stance (Gal's Study)**
- Content describes problems and solutions in private domain for "It Gets Better" campaign
- Content varies greatly among user-generated images in the "Pepper-Spraying Cop" meme

**Political Versions:**
- Officers pepper-spray iconic American symbols, criticizing violation of basic values

**Pop Culture Versions:**
- Officers pepper-spray celebrities or other internet memes
- Open to multiple interpretations
- Stance varies: sardonic in political versions, humorous in pop culture ones

**Meme Scope:**
- Internet memes can be groups of interconnected content units sharing common characteristics (content, form, stance)
- Differentiation between memetic dimensions may help draw boundaries between memes.


### 5 Memes versus Virals

**Internet Meme vs Viral**

**Definition of Virality:**
- Rapid increase in exposure to a message due to person-to-person diffusion
- Single cultural unit (video, photo, or joke) that propagates in many copies
- Attributes: person-to-person mode, great speed, broad reach

**Differences between Meme and Viral:**
1. Number of texts: A single video may be viral but not memetic as it lacks derivatives. An Internet meme consists of a collection of texts that together make up the meme.
2. Spectrum: Think of viral and memetic as ends of a dynamic spectrum rather than binary dichotomy. Most content has both viral and memetic aspects.
3. Foundation: Memes are often founded on a specific text, video, or photo (founder-based meme), which may be viral initially.
4. Popularity distribution: In egalitarian memes, popularity is more evenly distributed among numerous versions compared to pure virals.
5. User involvement: Viral content involves personalized meta-comments while memetic content invites modifications of the text itself.
6. Academic research focus: Studies on virality focus on transmission model of communication, while studies on memes embrace ritual model.
7. Communication modes: Both viral and memetic content are active forms of engagement but engage users differently.

**Examples:**
- "Leave Britney Alone": Video became a viral video when it gained wide popularity, later evolving into an Internet meme with numerous derivatives (founder-based meme).
- LOLCats: Egalitarian meme with many versions based on a certain formula and even popularity distribution.


### 6 Unpacking Viral and Memetic Success

**Factors Enhancing Virality of Internet Content**

**Positivity and Humor**:
- People are more likely to share positive than negative stories
- Positive content makes others feel good and reflects well on the sender
- Humorous content is particularly sharable due to its surprising nature

**Provoking "High-Arousal" Emotions**:
- Emotionally arousing content, both positive and negative, is more likely to be shared
- "Awa" stories (positive with high emotional arousal) are the most forwarded
- Negative high-arousal emotions can also drive sharing, particularly anger and anxiety

**Packaging**:
- Clear and simple content spreads better than complex
- Kony 2012 video was simple in its definition of the problem and proposed solution

**Prestige**:
- Famous authors or celebrities associated with a piece of content increase its viral potential
- "Attention philanthropy" strategy used by Kony 2012 campaign to gain celebrity support

**Positioning**:
- Editorial decisions on the location and timing of content in digital space and time can impact virality


#### Viral content: common features of memetic videos, focusing on ordinary people and user engagement

**Viral Content: Positioning and Participation**

**Positioning**:
- Stories in prominent locations on New York Times home page are more viral than those in less central locations
- "Positioning" can refer to the location of a message within social networks and association with certain actors
- **Seeding strategies**: selecting initial set of targeted consumers (hubs and bridges) to send messages to is crucial for viral process
- Well-positioned and organized actors can ignite the viral process

**Participation**:
- Sharing content is not enough, people need to be encouraged to engage in related activities
- Commercial campaigns that provide opportunities for audience to affect are more successful
- Political campaigns like Kony 2012 provided users with opportunity to assert influence via social media
- Active engagement of users in re-creating or appropriating items deepens their sense of involvement

**Memetic Content**:
- Some viral content evolves to be memetic: content units that generate user-created derivatives
- Memetic videos share common features: focus on ordinary people, flawed masculinity, humor, simplicity, repetitiveness, and whimsical content.
- YouTube's focus on ordinary people contributes to the popularity of memetic videos

**Ordinary People**:
- 17 out of 30 memetic videos feature ordinary people
- User-generated videos tend to generate more derivatives than traditional media videos
- People react more to user-generated videos compared to professionally produced videos


#### Study on memetic videos: Humor, flawed masculinity, and incongruity in viral content.

**Factors Contributing to the Popularity of User-Generated Videos on YouTube:**
* Simple production: easier to imitate (ordinary people as protagonists)
* Ordinary men as leading characters in most videos
* Flawed masculinity presented comically: far from perfect men who fail to meet prevalent expectations
* Humor is a key feature of memetic videos: playfulness, incongruity, and superiority

**Impact of Humor on Memes:**
* Quirky and situational humor dominates the sample
* Biting social commentary humor not present in this specific group
* Playfulness lures user creativity by summoning viewers to take part in a game
* Incongruity derives from unexpected cognitive encounter between audio and visual components
* Superiority: unintentional or not clearly intended humor adds to the dissonance that users may feel inclined to solve or further highlight.


#### Exploring memetic videos: superiority, simplicity, repetitiveness, whimsical content, and their impact on virality.

**Features of Popular Memetic Videos**

**Superiority**:
- Association of comic with superiority theory
- Laughter as expression of one-upmanship pleasure
- Popularity of videos responding to memes, such as "David after Dentist" or "Star Wars Kid"

**Simplicity**:
- Videos employing simple construction of topics or ideas
- Visual construction featuring few performers and domestic settings
- Unedited, filmed in one take
- Plain white background or simple design
- Enables easy imitation by users with limited resources and digital literacy

**Repetitiveness**:
- Incorporation of one simple unit repeated throughout the clip
- Examples: "Chocolate Rain" lyrics and melody, "Peanut Butter Jelly Time" banana
- Found in both user-generated and professional videos (e.g., "Single Ladies")
- Encourages active user involvement in remaking video memes
- Enhances memorability for potential memetic success

**Whimsical Content**:
- Absence of concrete themes, focusing on playfulness and lack of content
- Popular culture references as a common connection to viewers
- Memetic videos may incorporate all six attributes or just a few.

**Examples:**
- "Gangnam Style" (ordinary people, flawed masculinity, humor, simplicity, repetitiveness, whimsical)
- PSY's unique style and appeal in the "K-pop" scene
- Simplicity demonstrated through clear elements like "Gangnam Style" text or horse-riding dance.


#### Memes: Analyzing the features of viral photos and videos in contemporary culture, focusing on incongruity and frozen motion.

**Memetic Features and Participatory Culture**

**Common Thread in Memetic Videos**:
- Focus on ordinary people
- Flawed masculinity
- Humor
- Simplicity
- Repetitiveness
- Whimsical content
- Marks them as textually incomplete or flawed
- Distinct from and defiant of glossy corporate content
- Invites users to fill in gaps, address puzzles, or mock the creator
- Enhances "spreadability" of content

**Conclusion**:
- "Bad" texts make "good" memes in contemporary participatory culture
- Incompleteness serves as a textual hook for further dialogue and successful spread of the meme
- Memetic videos spread the notion of participatory culture itself: a culture based on active spread and re-creation of content by users

**Memetic Photos**:
- Memetic photos: photographs that attract extensive user-created responses, usually in the format of Photoshop-based collages
- Two thematic groups: memetic photos featuring politicians and those devoted to other themes (e.g., ordinary people or entertainment celebrities)
- Two prevalent features: **image juxtaposition** and **frozen motion**

**Image Juxtaposition**:
- Striking incongruity between two or more elements in the frame
- One person who sticks out as alien to the surrounding situation (e.g., "Frowning Flower Girl", "Disaster Girl")
- Calls for memetic responses: reappropriation of the person into other contexts
- Users deepen the ridicule or diminish the initial incongruity by repositioning the character in a more appropriate context

**Frozen Motion**:
- Memetic photos depicting people in the midst of physical activity (e.g., running, dancing, blowing soap bubbles)
- Capture people in a ludicrous posture, especially ungainly body positioning
- Users are drawn to "join the action" and complete the seemingly unfinished movement


### 7 Meme Genres

**Meme Genres:** Internet Meme Genres Based on Vernacular Creativity

### 8 May the Excessive Force Be with You: Memes as  Political Participation

**Political Memes as Forms of Participation: An Overview**
* Political memes intertwined with power dynamics and governance discussions
* Exploration of political participation through Internet memes
* Three functions of political memes: persuasion, grassroots action, expression

**Functions of Political Memes:**
1. **Persuasion or Political Advocacy:**
   * Influential in both democratic and nondemocratic contexts
   * Videos like "Obama Girl," "Wassup," and "Yes We Can" attracted millions of views during the 2008 US presidential campaign
   * Personal influence plays a crucial role in persuasion
   * Virality considered persuasive due to high view counts
2. **Grassroots Action:**
   * Linking personal experiences with politics for coordinated action
   * Digital connective action theory by Lance Bennett and Alexandra Segerberg
3. **Expression and Public Discussion:**
   * Accessible, cheap, and enjoyable way to voice opinions
   * Major events generate a flux of commentary memes
* Memes in democratic contexts: grassroots movements, election campaigns
* Memes in nondemocratic contexts: potential for democratic subversion.

**Persuasion through Political Virals:**
* Videos from the 2008 US presidential campaign attracted significant views and public attention
* Personal influence and virality considered persuasive
* YouTube enabled new voices to enter political process, but traditional actors dominated with high view counts: official campaigns (55,000 views), candidate-sponsored ads (60,000 views), interest groups (139,000 views), citizen-designed ads (807,000 views), and other entities (2.5 million+ views).


#### Viral videos and memes in political campaigns: power dynamics and citizen empowerment.

**Viral Videos during Presidential Elections**
- Most viral videos of 2008 campaigns produced by established organizations (not "lone citizens")
- Professional production quality: "Yes We Can" video produced by Obama-supporting artists, cinematographer, and director
- Campaign members played important role in spreading the video
- Bloggers also influential in diffusion through blog posts and media coverage

**Role of Political Blogs**
- Central role of political blogs in viral video diffusion
- Study by Kevin Wallsten showed campaign member statements and blog discussion significantly influenced views and media coverage

**Memes as Political Action**
- Memes play important role in citizen empowerment, especially in connective action
- Two types of logic: old logic (organizational resources) and connective action (personalized content sharing)
- Occupy Wall Street movement: essential for stimulating mass participation while maintaining individuality

**Memetic Photos in Political Actions**
- Memes serve as links between personal and political, allowing citizens to participate in collective actions while expressing their own stories
- Personalization of memes beneficial for both individuals spreading them and the rhetoric of political movements (e.g., "99 Percent")

**Memes in Grassroots Movements**
- Prevalence of memes in connective action, as seen in Occupy Wall Street protests
- Initiated by Adbusters magazine editors who advocated creative vandalism and countermemes to resist corporate messages.


#### Exploring political memetics: culture jamming, Occupy Wall Street, and interplay of frontstage and backstage in memetic photos

**Culture Jamming:**
- Practiced since early 1990s, gained mass popularity in the 21st century due to image editing software and social media
- Involves altering consumer icons to challenge societal norms
- Occupy Wall Street movement intertwined with culture jamming through memes

**Occupy Wall Street Memes:**
- Initiated by Adbusters' "Ballerina on Charging Bull" poster
- Encouraged participation and expression of diverse opinions
- Memetic dialogue between "99 Percent" and "53 Percent" memes
- Playful use of pop culture references in political discourse, e.g., Star Wars characters

**Meme Functions:**
- Persuasion: Grassroots movements, such as the "99 Percent" meme
- Action: Ignites discourse and encourages participation
- Discussion: Facilitates approachable political conversations through pop culture references

**Political Memetic Photos:**
- Single image that relates to political actors and controversies
- Interplay between frontstage (public) and backstage (private) performances of politicians.


#### Political memes: Exposing manipulated images and promoting democracy, especially in China

**Political Photos and Memes**

**Instances of Breaching Front- and Backstage Realms**:
- Examples: Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, Watergate
- Politicians required to apologize for actions behind the scenes

**Carefully Articulated Exposure of Political Backstage**:
- Prominent examples: White House Situation Room photo, Netanyahu-Shalit photo
- Users expose photos as "inauthentic," "flawed," and "manipulated"

**Bibi Gump Meme**:
- Situates Netanyahu in historic events, taking credit for unrelated accomplishments
- Ridicules the politician's attempt to claim credit

**Sarkozy Was There Meme**:
- Photo of Sarkozy at Berlin Wall, later shown to have been taken a week after the historical moment
- Users mock the politician's misrepresentation of events

**Three Chinese Officials Meme**:
- Photoshopped image of officials appearing to levitate above ground
- Memetic responses relocate the officials into other contexts

**Memes as Democratic Subversion: The Case of China**:
- Internet has become an important arena for public discourse in China

- Netizens use ironic and subversive memes to resist censorship
  - Examples: "River Crab" meme, "Grass Mud Horse" meme


### 9 When Internet Memes Go Global

**Internet Memes as Agents of Globalization**

**Introduction:**
- Internet memes are not confined to local cultures
- Rapid growth of Internet has accelerated globalization processes
- Debate between cultural homogenization and heterogeneity: glocalization

**Definitions and Controversies:**
- Globalization: complex interconnections between societies, cultures, institutions, and individuals worldwide
- Criticisms: Western imperialism, economic exploitation, linguistic imperialism
- Glocalization: blending global and local influences

**Two Modes of Meme Diffusion:**
1. Verbal Memes:
   - Example: "Upgrading from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0" joke
   - Translation into various languages (Chinese, Spanish, etc.)
   - Found in eight out of nine non-English languages examined

**User-Generated Globalization:**
- Not driven by high-profile commercial agencies
- Focuses on daily practices of ordinary users
- Invisible origins: local markers added after translation
- Scales and scope explored through studies, e.g., "Upgrading from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0" joke.


#### Joke Translations: Globalization, Cultural Differences, User-Generated Content, Humor, Stereotypes, Internet, Memes, Language, Visual Content, Westernization

**Global Spread of Jokes: Findings from Studies**

**Study Limitations**:
- Focused on a single case study
- Could not draw general conclusions

**Recent Study Expansion**:
- Conducted by Hadar Levy, Mike Thelwall, and the author
- Analyzed translations of 100 popular jokes in English to top languages spoken by Internet users

**Key Findings**:
- User-generated globalization through joke translation is common but varies greatly across languages
- Some languages (Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, French, German) had more translated copies of jokes compared to others (Chinese, Arabic, Korean, Japanese)
- Cultural proximity may play a role in the differences found between languages
- Jokes circulate widely across the globe but some are "translation resistant" and appear only in English

**Topics of "Global" Jokes**:
- Gender differences and consumerism are common themes
- Jokes tend to avoid specific places or companies, focusing on high-profile corporations or products

**Visual Content Globalization**:
- Visual content may cross linguistic and national borders with greater ease than verbal humor
- Visual memes like "Successful Black Man" can be localized to fit different cultures

**Example: Successful Black Man Meme in Israel**:
- Features a photo of a young black man dressed in a suit, with captions reversing stereotypes
- Challenges readers' racist assumptions by presenting counterexamples to stereotypes
- Has migrated from the US into other national settings (e.g., Israel) and been altered to fit local culture


#### Understanding meme adaptations: Localization and identity expression through "Gangnam Style" example.

**Meme Analysis: "Akiva, the Humanist Ultra-Orthodox Man" and "Gangnam Style"**

**Akiva, the Humanist Ultra-Orthodox Man**
- **Format**: Top line alludes to stereotype, bottom line subverts it
- Example: "Woman, to the kitchen" becomes "you need to taste the kartoffel that I made you"
- Israeli version of "Successful Black Man" meme
- Confirms and subverts stereotypes at first glance, but deeper analysis reveals differences
- Name attached conveys message of singular exception validating stereotype
- May be interpreted as parody on American origin by some viewers

**Gangnam Style**
- **Format**: Simple, repetitive elements; whimsical content
- Wide array of adaptations spanning languages and nationalities
- Users react to video by charging it with local meaning
- Substitutions for "Gangnam" relate to national, regional, or subcultural identities
- Some clips use the video as social satire; others for self-promotion or personal styles.

**Impact of Local Memes in a Globalized World:**
- Each memetic version is unique, reflecting digital literacy and creativity of producers
- Adding one's version signals membership in larger community that enjoys similar (pop) culture artifacts.


### 10 Future Directions for Internet Meme Research

**Internet Meme Research: Future Directions**

**1. The Politics of Memetic Participation**
- Understanding individuals who generate and diffuse Internet memes
- Examining participation patterns in relation to demographics (race, ethnicity, gender, power)
- Discovering if Internet memes serve as alternative routes for marginalized groups or reflect power structures

**2. Internet Memes as a Language**
- Internet memes have evolved into distinct formulas and shared spheres of cultural knowledge
- Memetic language allows for complex ideas to be conveyed within short phrases/images
- Appropriate meme use is negotiated through continuous intergroup discussions within "meme hubs"
- Research needed on how this language is used by diverse groups (global vs. local identities, cultural capital)

**3. Memes and Political Change**
- Internet memes have been used as modes of political participation in democratic and nondemocratic countries
- Extent to which memes influence political processes (legislation or regime change) remains unclear
- Future research needed on what constitutes an Internet meme's "effect" and how it can be measured

**4. Viral and Memetic Success**
- Factors that enhance viral success differ from those that enhance memetic success
- Memetic videos compete well in contemporary attention economies, strengthening the status of originals while promoting derivatives
- Future research needed to look into distinctive factors enhancing virality and memetic uptake in specific genres (commercial advertising, political campaigns)
