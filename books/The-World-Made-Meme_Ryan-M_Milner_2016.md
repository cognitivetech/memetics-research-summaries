## Introduction The Rise of Memetic Media.

**Introduction to The Memetic Tapestry**

**Memetics**:
- Emerging patterns in public conversations
- Social participation essential to these conversations
- Focus on internet memes: linguistic, image, audio, video texts
- Shared in-jokes, catchphrases, signature texts

**Internet Memes**:
- Forms: pictures captioned on Reddit, puns hashtagged on Twitter, videos mashed up on YouTube
- Widely shared catchphrases, Auto-Tuned songs, manipulated stock photos, recordings of physical performances
- Used to make jokes, argue points, connect friends

**History of Memetics**:
- Emerged from esoteric forums and message boards
- Linked Richard Dawkins' theories of cultural replication to shared in-jokes, catchphrases, and signature texts
- Scope and reach has widened over the past 20 years

**Examples of Memetic Media**:
- "Binders Full of Women," "The Harlem Shake," "Pepper Spray Cop," "We are the 99 Percent," "Double Rainbow Guy," "Ridiculously Photogenic Guy," "Planking," "Kanye Interrupts," "Rickrolling," "Slenderman," "Hands Up, Don't Shoot," "Black Lives Matter," "Yes All Women," and "The Ice Bucket Challenge"
- Memetic media are aggregate texts, collectively created, circulated, and transformed by countless cultural participants

**Understanding Memetic Media**:
- Requires understanding intertextual connections, even when assessing singular texts
- Memetics is a set of social practices, not just individual texts
- Focus on the social processes essential to the creation, circulation, and transformation of collective texts

**Methodology**:
- Corpus of media texts and popular commentary built since 2010
- Limitations: limited to 2010-2015 timeframe, mostly English-speaking, US contexts


## Part I Media Made Memetic

**Part I: Media Made Memetic**

**Argument**: Memetic media serve as a lingua franca for digitally mediated participation, allowing geographically dispersed participants to connect and share.

**Chapters 1-3**: Focus on the micro and meso layers of memetic media, explaining how participants express and engage through these layers.

**Participatory Media**: Accelerate the memetic dimensions in a media ecology where making statements, remixing texts, or spreading ideas is relatively cheap and easy.

**Understanding Memetic Media**: Requires assessing the logics, grammar, and vernacular that underpin these media.

**Historical Context**: In 2010, many were unfamiliar with the term "memetic media"; by 2015, it had become more integrated into popular parlance. Some view this as a moment when memes were "done to death," while others see it as a new era of cultural participation.

**Part I's Scope**: Not limited to internet memes but rather the logics, grammar, and vernacular essential to memetic media, which are more persistent than any individual exemplar. Addresses both niche corners and wide array of conversations across platforms and eras.

**Criticisms**: Some may question the utility of using the memetic lens for understanding public conversation due to potential deterministic implications. This book aims to complicate these criticisms by demonstrating that memetic participation emphasizes transformative reappropriation over simple imitation.

**Chapter 1**: Outlines the logics foundational to memetic participation and addresses the relationship between Dawkins's deterministic perspectives on idea spread and the realities of memetic media.

**Chapters 2-3**: Demonstrate that social dimensions of memetic participation involve transformative reappropriation rather than simple "brain-to-brain" imitation.


### 1 Logics The Fundamentals of Memetic Participation. The Many Interruptions of Kanye West

**The Many Interruptions of Kanye West**

**September 13, 2009**:
- Kanye West interrupts Taylor Swift at the MTV Video Music Awards
- West tells Swift that Beyoncé should have won for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"
- The moment is circulated and transformed through various media channels

**The Spread of "Imma Let You Finish"**:
- Phrase becomes a strand of creative play in public conversation
- Spawns imitative mass media moments, e.g., Jay-Z interrupting West at the 2012 BET Awards
- West's interruption is remixed and inserted into various cultural contexts, e.g., with Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech

**Internet Memes**:
- Memes are multimodal texts that facilitate participation by reappropriation
- Memes have common characteristics, mutual awareness, and transformative circulation
- Memes can be vastly public, communally social, or intimately interpersonal
- Memes can complicate narrow ideas about the singularity of media texts

**Collective Creation and Sharing**:
- Audiences have mashed West up with Darth Vader, royal weddings, and YouTube's "Keyboard Cat"
- Participants circulate creations of others, demonstrating the "collective" and "connective" work of mediated publics

**Memetics as a Cultural Theory**:
- The term "meme" originated in the work of biologist Richard Dawkins
- Memes are units of cultural transmission that spread through social media
- The application of meme to internet memes raises questions about individual agency in the social spread of information


#### Reintroducing the Meme

**Meme: An Introduction**

**Dawkins' Concept of Memes**:
- Term coined by Dawkins to describe the flow and flux of culture
- Conceptualized as cultural corollaries to genes, with deterministic effects on a social level analogous to genetic determinism
- Comparison between "genes" and "memes" in terms of their ability to propagate themselves

**Meme Propagation**:
- Memes propagate through imitation and spread from brain to brain
- Can take the form of tunes, ideas, catchphrases, clothes fashions, etc.

**Memes in Cultural Concepts**:
- Broad cultural concepts like language, art, technology, and religion are composed of "co-adapted meme complexes" or "meme-plexes"

**Meme's Evolution**:
- Memetic theory has evolved within the biological sciences and made its way to the social sciences and humanities
- The term "meme" has been reinterpreted by participatory media collectives, who have applied it to various media texts

**Types of Memes**:
- **Memetic Phrases**: Examples include "Imma let you finish" and "What does it mean?"
- **Memetic Videos**: Example is the "Kanye Interrupts" meme
- **Memetic Performances**: Example is Kanye West's interruption of Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards
- **Memetic Images**: These are pervasive in mediated public conversation


##### Exploring the ambiguous relationship between internet memes and memetic theory in cultural participation.

**Memetics: Understanding Memetic Participation**

**Background:**
- Internet memes have a complex relationship with their biological anthropology namesake
- Shifman (2013) refers to memes as "conceptual troublemakers" due to the ambiguous connection between shared social practices and Dawkins' theories on cultural imitation

**Meme as a Concept:**
- The term was first used by cultural participants to describe texts they were creating, circulating, and transforming
- Memetic theory is a contested approach for understanding cultural processes
    - Criticized for favoring determinism over agency of social actors
    - Particularly problematic in the context of participatory media and "viral marketing"

**Godwin's Law:**
- Proposed by Mark Godwin (1994) as a callout to Nazi comparison meme
- States: "As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one."
- Intended to seed a counter-meme for participants to collectively rebuke Nazi comparisons

**Critique of Determinism:**
- Memetics can acknowledge individual agency in cultural transmissions while appreciating collective significance
- Shifman frames internet memes as "(post)modern folklore," highlighting shared norms and values constructed through artifacts
- Memetics doesn't have to be limited to Dawkins' original conceptualization from 1976 or his later views in 2013.


#### Fundamental Logics

**Memetic Media: Understanding the Fundamentals**

**Introduction:**
- Memetics as a result of individual decisions leading to collective practice
- Virality characterized by social sharing, acceleration, and reach

**Logics: The Fundamentals of Memetic Participation**

**1. Multimodality:**
- Internet memes are multimodal: communication media vs. communicative modes
- Blurring of word, image, audio, video, and hypertext on the internet
- "Kanye Wes Anderson" images weave multiple modes together (figure 1.5)
- Complex layers of meaning within individual texts
- Audiences read meanings from various contexts
- Hypertext allows messages to spread beyond tumblog

**2. Reappropriation:**
- Tumblr post "Kanye Wes Anderson": mashup video (figure 1.6)
- Film and song collide in a single message
- Multiple communicative modes intertwine: visuals from The Royal Tenenbaums, lyrics from Kanye West and Jay-Z's songs
- Creativity within shared criteria

**Logics: The Fundamentals of Memetic Participation (continued)**

**3. Resonance:**
- Reading complex meanings in fleeting seconds
- Multimodal messages resonate despite brevity
- Audiences match new texts to already-understood contexts

**4. Collectivism:**
- Memetic media as modern, mediated folk texts
- Individual expression and collective precedent intertwine (Whitney Phillips)
- Subcultural collectives decide memetic spread

**5. Spread:**
- Virality as a lens for understanding the collective flow of information
- Logics fundamental to memetic participation: multimodality, reappropriation, resonance, collectivism, and spread.


#### Reappropriation

**Reappropriation in Memetic Media**

**Essential Concept:** Reappropriation is a crucial concept in memetic media, where novel texts are woven into existing contexts.

**Definition of Reappropriation**:
- Essential for memetic media spread
- Blending and mutation of old and new content
- Creativity within an imposed system (de Certeau)

**Examples:**
1. **Kanye Wes Anderson**: Creative recombination of existing works
2. **Image Macros**: Repurposing predetermined visual subjects with new jokes
3. **"Hipster Kitty"**: Stock character macros that spread through reappropriation
4. **Cross-stitched "Hipster Kitty"**: Replicating image macro format in tactile media

**Impact of Digital Media**:
- Easier creation and sharing of cultural texts
- Increased opportunities for participation
- Memetic media thrives on creative reuse of existing content.


##### Exploring memetic resonance in media: studium and punctum connections.

**Memetic Media: The Power of Resonance**

**Resonance in Memetic Texts**
- Connects with participants to inspire iteration after iteration from a fixed premise
- Difficult to articulate definitively or universally
- Carries personal meaning and importance
- Motivates creation, circulation, and transformation essential to memetic media

**Barthes' Perspective on Resonance**
- Texts are a "multiplicity"
- Reader pulls together the multiplicity
- Connection to text becomes even more powerful in visual images
- Resonance: studium and punctum
  - Studium: connection at cultural level (socially coded appreciation)
  - Punctum: connection at personal level (what pierces or pricks the viewer)

**Memetic Media Participation**
- Creation, circulation, and transformation depend on both studium and punctum resonance
- Analysis of memetic content alone can't tell us how texts prick their audience
- Importance of emotional resonance (Miltner 2014)
  - Interested in communal participation or interpersonal connection
- Sharing memetic texts: humorous, surprising, emotionally arousing (Shifman 2014)
- Whimsy and simplicity help connect diverse participants
- Irony, humor, and play essential to resonance

**Incongruity in Memetic Media**
- Violation of accepted pattern or noted difference
- Not too shocking nor mundane
- Surprising relevance between two seemingly unrelated texts (e.g., figure 1.9)
- Inspires circulation and further transformation when punctum resonates with viewers.


##### Memetics in social media: Collective participation, individual expression, and memetic texts' circulation and transformation.

**Memetic Media: Collectivism and Participation**

**The Campaign's Argument:**
- Life gets better for LGBT adults after teenage struggles
- Empowering hope resonates, not humor

**Human Rights Campaign's Marriage Equality Logo:**
- Widespread spread through collective resonance
- Sympathetic power in appealing image

**Memetic Participation:**
- Connects individuals to social groups and identities
- Collective fabric woven through texts and conversations
- Populist, reminiscent of oral culture

**Memetic Media and Folk Culture:**
- Bridge between individual and collective
- Resonates with traditional oral culture

**Kanye Wes Anderson Tumblr:**
- Quasi collective, individual constellation of texts
- Dependent on broader collective aesthetics
- Not collectively remixed memes but part of macro aesthetic

**Collectivism in Memetic Media:**
- Reappropriates image macro precedent
- Exists within a constellation of other mashup tumblogs
- Single-topic, single-author tumblogs demonstrate creation, circulation, and transformation prevalent in memetic media

**Memetic Collectivism:**
- Gatekeeping influence on collective participation
- Top-down media professionals at sites like Buzzfeed or informal gatekeeping practices.


#### How Memes Matter

**Memetic Media: The Fundamentals of Memetic Participation**

**Logics of Memetic Media:**
- Collective creation and circulation: memes spread through social processes, creating new cultural tapestries
- Multimodality: texts can be phrasal, performative, image or video
- Reappropriation: participants use texts for diverse ends, creating new meanings
- Resonance: texts resonate with situated political and technological contexts
- Collectivism: memes are a result of collective practices, not individual texts or people

**Characteristics of Memetic Media:**
- Significant in the same way as other everyday texts
- Participatory means of "making do" for cultural participants
- Blur vernacular conversation and creative production
- Amplified by the buzzing multitude producing them
- Social, not selfish (contradicting Dawkins' genes)

**Logics at Work:**
- Memes can be collectively reappropriated despite limited spread or collectivism
- "Kanye Wes Anderson" image is an example of a memetic text despite its limited spread
- Memetic media are significant for the logics underlying individual texts and collective practices.


### 2 Grammar Structures for Making Statements and Making Do. The Death of the Meme

**The Death of the Meme**

**Online Memes:**
- Fernando Alfonso III (2014) speculates on the decline of internet memes
- Image macros, once novel, now seen as "diluted" and "not funny or relevant anymore"
- Overuse on Reddit led to broadening content and algorithm changes on Facebook

**Shifts in Memetic Practices:**
- Phillips (2015) chronicles the dilution of memes and trolling practices
- Emergence of reference database Know Your Meme, democratizing meme understanding
- Commercialization of internet culture conferences and 4chan's shift towards mainstream popularity

**Denigration of Memes:**
- Image macros mocking memes and the cultural practices surrounding them (Figure 2.1)
- Connections to juvenile contexts, denigrating memes as "dank" or outdated (Figure 2.2)

**Subcultural Corruption**:
- Narrative of discrete subcultures opposing a hegemonic mainstream is fallacious
- The interconnectedness and blurring of boundaries between subcultures and the mainstream.


#### Toward a Multimodal Grammar

**Understanding Memetic Media: The Grammar of Visual Communication**

**Background**
- Dick Hebdige's study on British punks in the 1970s (Hebdige, 1979)
- Antithesis to mainstream through memetic logics
- Utility in exploring niche collectives and mass participants

**Memes as Memetic Logics**
- Persistent power despite shifts in subculture edge
- Pervasive presence in various conversations

**Visual Grammar of Images**
- Kress & van Leeuwen's Reading Images (2006)
- Descriptive account of how systems of meaning are constructed
- Implicit understanding of visual code

**Historical Significance of Visual Communication**
- Ancient use in pharaonic Egypt, Pompeii ruins, and Roman barracks
- Middle Ages: illuminated manuscripts, coats of arms
- Renaissance: systematic naturalism and mechanical printing technology
- Integral to public life since Enlightenment

**Political Cartoons as Visual Satire**
- Example from 1798: "Treason..." by Richard Newton
- Crude visual gesture as effective satire
- Reduction technique in satire (Lamb, 2004)

**Cultural Codes and the Grammar of Reading Images**
- Resonance through culturally encoded ways of seeing
- Understanding visual grammar within cultural contexts.


##### An analysis of "Sad Batman" meme: Image transformation through satire and contextual interpretation.

**Resonance in Images: Analyzing Memetic Media**

**Understanding Resonance**
- Essential for inspiring creation, circulation, and transformation of memetic iterations
- Can resonate at studium or punctum level

**Content, Form, and Stance**
- **Content**: what the image says
- **Form**: how the image looks
- **Stance**: information conveyed about communication (Lester 1995; Kress & van Leeuwen 2006; Rose 2012)

**Analyzing Memetic Images**
- Compositional elements: color, space, perspective, distance, focus, movement, detail
- Memetic media have extensive intertextuality

**Resonance and Collective Dimensions**
- If something doesn't resonate enough, it won't spread
- Unexpected results from multimodal grammar application (Warner Bros. Studios experience with "Sad Batman")

**"Sad Batman": A Case Study**
1. **Original Image**: promotional photo for Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice shared by Zack Snyder on Twitter in 2014
2. **Dominant Read**: dark and hypermasculine connotations associated with Batman
3. **Negotiated Reads**: satirical stance towards Snyder’s Batman image due to fan criticisms of Ben Affleck casting as Batman
4. **Memetic Reappropriation**: "Sad Batman" memes creating new meanings, emasculating the masked vigilante
5. **Images showing Batman's defeat**: top image - defeated by a spilled glass of milk; bottom image - passive victim of bullying.


##### Analyzing memetics: multimodal communication and participatory culture through examples of "Sad Batman" and animated GIFs.

**Sad Batman Memes: Understanding Multimodal Communication in Participatory Media**

**Background:**
- Batman's image used in unexpected settings creates humorous juxtapositions, known as "Sad Batman" memes
- Cultural understanding of characters turns on its head to make jokes at hero's expense
- Easy creation, circulation, and transformation through participatory media

**Visual Communication:**
- Images keep Batman small in bigger settings, alone in social spaces
- Humorous juxtaposition using space
- Multimodal communication: words, sounds, videos, hypertext, physical performance can have memetic dimensions

**Example of Multimodal Memes:**
1. **#TBT**: phrasal acronym turned hashtag on social media, labeling images
2. Auto-Tuning: video recording manipulated with source audio for humorous effect
3. "Rickroll" meme: hypertext link leads to unexpected music video
4. "Ice Bucket Challenge": physical performance becomes internet meme through video sharing

**Animated GIFs:**
- Not quite image, not quite video
- Small, looping files without audio or playback controls
- Versatile and spreadable format
- Essential to participatory media ecology (Tumblr, Reddit, Imgur)
- Liminality provides resonance as memetic texts.

**Multimodal Grammar:**
- Facilitates shared creation, circulation, and transformation of memetic media
- Reappropriation is essential to memetic grammar.


#### Bricolage Poaching and Reappropriation

**Memetic Media and Bricolage**

**Bricolage and Poaching**:
- Central concept in memetic media
- Reappropriation of existing materials
- Creating something unique from borrowed contributions
- Foundational to memetic participation
- Examples: intertextual references, Internet memes

**Claude Lévi-Strauss and Michel de Certeau**:
- Theorized creative production in terms of reappropriation
- Bricoleur: someone who "makes do" with limited resources
- Poacher: produces from within ecologies they don't control

**Memetic Grammar and Bricolage**:
- Implicit and flexible guide for social participation
- Provides a way to read and write multimodal texts
- Memetic media are rich in bricolage

**Example of Bricolage in Memetic Texts**:
- Figure 2.8: Poaching and annotating Donn Kenn's "monster drawings" on 4chan, Imgur, and Reddit
- Creators add their voice to the original expression through small acts of creativity
- Resonated in its reappropriation

**Memetic Theory**:
- Memes defined by longevity, fecundity, and fidelity
- Transformative reappropriation complicates memetic theory
- Success may mean something different for internet memes than genes.


##### Memetics: Transformation, Reappropriation, and Participatory Media.

**Memetic Media: Flexibility of Grammar and Memetic Participation**

**Criteria for Virality**:
- Memetic media can spread even among a small group if they are imitating and transforming from a shared ingroup premise.
- The flexibility of grammar in participatory media allows for conversational mutations that influence the duration and flow of memetic media.

**Reappropriation and Transformation**:
- Reappropriation and transformation produce conversational mutations that force us to acknowledge that imitation is only the beginning of reappropriation.
- Memetic replication involves "tangled knots" rather than the "elegant simplicity of the double helix".
- Fidelity may be an asset for genes, but memes are stronger when transformative practices allow individual variations on collective premises.

**Imitation vs. Reappropriation**:
- Imitation of others' language can facilitate the spread of memetic hashtags and phrases like #TBT or "dank memes".
- Imitative spread brought Donn Kenn's Post-It note monster images to a popular Reddit thread, leaving the images unaltered.
- GIFs transcribing film and television scenes are examples of imitative transmission of media texts.

**Reaction Shots**:
- Reaction shots reappropriate popular media to provide social cues in mediated conversation, even as they leave the source text unaltered.
- Reaction shots spark a chain of accompanying GIFs that respond to each other, creating a multiturn, multiparticipant conversation around a single reaction shot.

**Memetic Participation**:
- The transformation of pop media is essential to memetic participation.
- Memes like "Sad Batman" or quotations from The Dark Knight have been reappropriated for different contexts on participatory media platforms.
- The Joker's line "it's not about the money; it's about sending a message" inspired a stock character macro with various applications.


##### Analyzing memetic transformations of "The Joker" character through image macros: fidelity, social commentary, pastiche, and collective conversation.

**Image Macros and Memetic Reappropriation**

**Fidelity to Source Text**:
- Image macros demonstrate fidelity to their source text by commenting on societal inconsistencies
- Preserve the central idea of the original scene and raise awareness of the film/franchise

**Prototypical Image Macro Aesthetic**:
- Top-line setup flows into bottom-line punch line through visual subject
- Creates a sort of "vector" that produces an ellipsis, prompting the reader to take in the subject before finishing the joke

**Impact Font in Image Macros**:
- Predominant use of Impact font signals memetic expression
- Facilitates transformative reappropriation by participants

**Fidelity and Transformative Reappropriation**:
- Fidelity to a founder meme may undermine its longevity and fecundity
- Too much or too little fidelity can impact the meme's success
- Different standards for "Goldilocks balance" depending on participant goals, literacies, motivations, and perspectives

**Memetic Reappropriation as Pastiche vs. Poaching**:
- Memetic reappropriation may be seen as pastiche, but this assumes a singular purpose, utility, and audience
- Bricolage and poaching are the multimodal fabric of collective conversation
- Some memetic texts may be mere pastiche, while others may be commentary, flirt with both, or have other purposes

**Examples of Memetic Reappropriation on Reddit**:
- /r/ReactionGIFs: Collective reappropriation of pop media GIFs for social play
- /r/DubbedGIFs: Participants create humorous subtitles for pop media GIFs
- /r/BehindTheGIFs: Participants create "backstory" images as a setup to a punch line
- /r/PhotoshopBattles: Participants edit an original image in the comments, with the winner determined by upvotes


#### Memes Are Dead Long Live Memetics

**Memetic Media: Multimodal Reappropriation and Participation**

**Concepts:**
- Memes as cultural conversations
- Blend of imitation and transformation
- Bricolage and poaching in memetic communication
- Social sensitivity and creative innovation

**Grammar of Memetic Participation:**
1. **Multimodal reappropriation**: central to participatory media

#### Fixity and Novelty

**Memetic Participation: Prepatterned Vernacular**

**Prepatterning in Memetics:**
- Essential for memetic reappropriation (Chapter 2)
- Blend of fixity and novelty
- Balanced in collective vernacular

**Fixity and Novelty:**
- Repetition and variation essential to memetic participation
- Prepatterned frameworks: restrictions and affordances

**Prepatterning in Conversation (Tannen):**
- Play between fixity and novelty creates meaning
- Essential for every conversation
- Individual expressions woven into the fabric of discourse

**Memes:**
- Balance fixity and novelty through reappropriation
- Example: "Doge" meme, interior monologue captions
- Image macros: stock character macros, LOLCats
- Fixed aesthetic clues intertwine with novel expression

**Parody in Memetics:**
- Juxtaposition of understanding creates larger bursts of meaning
- Example: Figure 3.4 image macros, "Haters gonna hate" meme

**Memetic Texts:**
- Weave established tenets into new iterations
- Contextually versatile yet recognizable premise for participation
- Shared corpus sets precedent for novel expression.


##### Collective communication through memetics: fixity, novelty, and social identification.

**Prepatterning and Memetic Participation:**
* Depends on social practice and interaction
* Fixity allows participants to understand novel contributions
* Shared understanding develops despite anonymity and ephemerality of mediated public participation
* Speech acts create the collective, defining shared communicative practices
* Memetic dimensions make collective conversation more apparent in participatory media
* Collectivist dimensions enhanced by reappropriation
* Identification inspires memetic participation
* Global audiences enable memetic moments to be circulated and transformed on a worldwide stage
* Intimate interpersonal connections can also be facilitated through memetic texts
* Prepatterned tropes can produce diverse ends, from massively public to subcultural imaginations

**Fixity and Novelty in Memetic Media:**
* Essential for memetic participation
* Facilitates conversations both large and small
* Shared practices facilitate a whole continuum of participation
* Prepatterned tropes can be employed in diverse contexts
* Collective precedent produces diverse ends.

**Memetic Participation and Identification:**
* Social and cultural identification inspires memetic participation
* Enhanced by reappropriation
* Facilitates connections between public collectives, interpersonal relationships, and subcultural communities.

**Examples of Memetic Texts:**
* "Haters gonna hate": fixed premise with novel expressions (Candid shot of Leonardo DiCaprio, Photoshopped image of Albert Einstein riding a bicycle in the shadow of an atomic blast, photo of late Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi)
* "Kilroy was here": globally dispersed memetic message from World War II to present day
* "Doge": interior monologue captioning that became massively popular through Doge memes
* "LOLCats": interpersonal relationships punctuated by memetic texts
* "Dolan": darker edge with sexual assault, murder, and violent acts (obscure compared to more famous counterparts)
* /r/YouDontSurf: jux-taposition of wholesome implications and antagonistic added text creates incongruous humor.


#### Vernacular Creativity

**Vernacular: Everyday Expression in the Memetic Lingua Franca**

**Everyday Expression in Memetic Media:**
- Participants reappropriate media moments for their own uses
- Example: Reaction GIFs archive on Imgur.com
  * Over 3,200 images categorized by feeling, action, and source media
  * Curated between 2012 and 2014
  * Creator relented to the impossibility of keeping up with collective production
- Fixity and novelty are essential for conversational creativity

**Vernacular Creativity:**
- Tension between fixity and novelty constitutes creativity (Tannen)
- Memetic balance of imitation and transformation: evidence of social utility and creative adaptation
- Collective conversations intertwine with multimodal expression

**Everyday Expression:**
- Significant for expressive and conversational potential
- Memetic media are everyday acts of conversational creativity
- Connected to the folk, amateur, bricoleur aspects (not authentic or pure)

**Ambivalence in Vernacular Creativity:**
- Reappropriation of media carries vibrancy and ambivalence of everyday conversation
- Grammatical processes applied to "everyday" acts of creativity
- Memetic participation shades its reappropriation

**Example: Tumblr Post**
- Annotates a scene from Gone with the Wind
- Vernacular update of Rhett Butler's iconic line: "tbh bae idgaf"
- Humorous juxtaposition produced from translation of old sentiment into modern slang

**Ambiguous Ends in Memetic Creativity:**
- Populist dimensions mean diverse use but also ambivalent ends
- Reappropriations can be appropriations of more marginalized subaltern practices
- Example: "Medieval Reactions" Twitter account
  * Decontextualizes and stereotypically pantomimes African American vernacular
  * Normalizes narrow perspectives about the content and tone of that subaltern vernacular.


##### Exploring memetic practices and their ambivalent appropriation of subcultures, from Black Twitter to Ryan Gosling memes.

**Memetic Practices and Vernacular Creativity**

**Ambivalent Appropriation**:
- "Kanye Wes Anderson" and "Fly Art Productions" tumblogs: juxtapose film school icon and high art with African American vernacular in hip hop
- Imgur participants share screenshots from "Black Twitter" to appropriate and decontextually display cultural conversations
- Reddit's /r/BlackPeopleGIFs subreddit: reminds participants that "we’re all black here. Be cool."; participants reproduce positive and negative stereotypes
- 4chan participants have long appropriated stereotypical African American vernacular in conversations

**"The Harlem Shake" Performance Meme**:
- A performance meme shared heavily on YouTube in 2013, where participants film themselves doing a mundane dance before quickly cutting to a more ridiculous version
- Criticized for decontextualizing the song and accompanying dance from its namesake, predominantly minority Harlem community

**Internet Famous African American Figures**:
- Antoine Dodson and Sweet Brown: gained attention for resonant local news interviews; memetic resonance inspired creative play but raises questions about mass appropriation, stereotypes, and humorous whitewashing of real concerns to minority communities

**Memetic Prepatterns**:
- Memetic potential can premise texts that are hegemonic, subversive, or any shade in between
- **Fuck Yeah Ryan Gosling** tumblog: paired photos of actor with romantic quips; images range from empathetic to supportive to misogynistic
- **Feminist Ryan Gosling**: ironically combines heteronormative "Hey Girl" messages with pro-feminist messages, challenging or reinforcing values of the original meme

**Subcultural Standards and Collective Logics**:
- Collective dimensions of vernacular creativity fuel struggles between subcultural identities and mainstream practices
- Tug-of-war between memetic texts as esoterically subcultural and memetic texts as massively popular leads to identity clashes, even within specific participatory media collectives


##### Memetics and social imaginaries in memetic subcultures: collectivism, ingroup identification, boundary work, and outgroup othering.

**Memetic Participation and Collectivism**

**Tension between Subcultural and Mass Dimensions**:
- Memetic participation exacerbates tensions between subcultural and mass dimensions of collectivism
- Ease of memetic creation, circulation, and transformation pushes resonant esoteric texts to mainstream participation

**Collective Participation and Appropriations**:
- Collective dimensions of memetic participation lend themselves to subcultural identification
- Active participants police how others use their subcultural texts

**Subcultural Identification**:
- Participants on sites like 4chan, Reddit, Tumblr, and Imgur claim subcultural identification as "collective citizens"
- Labeling of the "internet as place" metaphors the set of collective practices, histories, and discourses that connect participants

**Vernacular: Everyday Expression in the Memetic Lingua Franca**:
- Memetic references, jokes, catchphrases, and histories gesture toward shared experiences and knit the "collective subcultural fabric"
- Memetic logics, grammar, and vernacular are employed to differentiate insiders from outsiders

**Boundary Work and Othering**:
- Boundary work comes across when certain practices are labeled "dead," "overused," or "corrupted" by mainstream enjoyment
- 4chan participants embrace the "tastemaker" mantle, expressing resentment when subaltern vernacular becomes common


##### Subcultural memetic rivalries: Us vs. Them, appropriation of vernacular creativity.

**Subcultural Assessments:**
- Us vs. Them mentality
- Perception of "death" of memes due to widespread participation and misunderstanding
- Frustration among participants on certain sites (4chan, Reddit) about others joining in
- Disagreements between sites regarding creative expression and technological competence

**Narrative of Appropriated Vernacular Creativity:**
- Origin: 4chan's /b/ board
- Early creation required technical proficiency for image macros
- Increased popularity led to meme generating platforms, allowing easier participation
- Expansion resulted in an explosion of templates and criticism from original participants
- Ongoing struggle over memetic vernacular between sites (4chan vs. Reddit, Reddit vs. Tumblr)

**Memetic Texts and Practices:**
- Fuel rivalries between groups
- Identities clash within memetic subcultures
- Ironic use of phrases or words as shorthand for mockable moments

**Vernacular Creativity:**
- Collective precedent shapes participation
- Benefits: collective conversations
- Exclusionary work when reappropriation becomes appropriation of marginalized identities.


#### Memetic Lingua Franca

**Vernacular: Everyday Expression in the Memetic Lingua Franca**

**The Power of Vernacular Creativity**:
- Tannen: "individual imagination makes possible shared understanding of language"
- "linguistic prepatterning" allows speakers to create shared understandings that listeners can recreate
- Collectivism is key to memetic creativity, as it enables participants to speak through the group and vice versa

**Diverse Forms of Vernacular Creativity**:
- Bounded collectives (e.g., 4chan, Reddit) require proficiency in fixed conversations and novelty for entry
- Memetic logics have become too prevalent to be policed by subcultural standards
- Multimodality and reappropriation are central to the vernacular spoken by vast constellations of participants

**The Memetic Lingua Franca**:
- Makes social worlds that are as varied as the perspectives, relationships, and contexts of its participants
- Interactions within this lingua franca are diverse, despite collective identity policing on sites like 4chan and Reddit
- Memetic logics and grammar are fundamental to diverse forms of vernacular creativity
- As the memetic lingua franca spreads, it brings with it shared phrases, references, in-jokes, and assumptions

**Memetic Media and Vernacular Creativity**:
- Memetic media are essential to both the subaltern and common dimensions of vernacular creativity
- Participants employing memetic logics become part of popular and populist conversations
- Acknowledging the limitations, Burgess sees vernacular creativity as a "space of hope" for cultural citizenship


## Part II Memetic Public Participation

**Memetic Public Participation**

**Overview:**
- Memetic media evidence polyvocal public participation
- Many voices can connect and converse through memetic logics, grammar, and vernacular
- Part II focuses on meso interactional layers and macro discursive layers of memetic media
- Discusses implications for civic participation, identity antagonisms, political voice, and cultural conversations

**Memetic Media and Public Voice:**
- Memetic media convey public voice through reappropriation, collectivism, and spread
- Polyphonic discourse in memetic media comprises many sounds created by a multiplicity of unfinished texts overlapping
- Participatory media open up new avenues for expression but can also drown out perspectives not aligned with hegemonic ones
- Public voice becomes empowering when expressions are acknowledged, respected, and engaged by others

**Chapter 4: Race and Gender Antagonisms:**
- Memetic media can afford counterpublic contestation of antagonisms but also perpetuate old inequalities
- Collective participation can lead to "mob rule," silencing subaltern perspectives

**Chapter 5: Political Commentary and Protest:**
- Memetic media complicate public engagement with diverse identities and ideas, even if old antagonisms persist

**Ambivalence in Memetic Participation:**
- Memetic collectives can turn attention toward unsuspecting bystanders for mockery and abuse
- Open media ecology allows rumors, falsities, commercial, and political appropriation to spread easily
- Part II assesses the promises and perils of polyvocality in a vast network of mediated expression

**Chapter 6: Media Industries and Memetic Media:**
- Connection between established media industries, participatory practices, and memetic media
- Ultimately, an assessment of the ambivalent identity politics and relationship with existing cultural practices.


### 4 Antagonism Race Gender and Counterpublic Contestation. Violentacrez Reddit and the Counterpublic Sphere1

**Violentacrez Controversy on Reddit**

**Background:**
- Violentacrez, a controversial Reddit user, revealed to be behind several offensive subreddits (e.g., /r/Jailbait, /r/Creepshots)
- Journalist outed Violentacrez's real identity in October 2012
- Debate ensued about pseudonymity and free speech vs. consent and ethics

**Impact:**
- Reddit subreddits responded: banned Gawker links, allowed only Gawker network links, etc.
- Intense contestation from various perspectives (/r/MensRights, /r/ShitRedditSays)
- Persistent questions about identity antagonisms in participatory media

**Issues:**
- **Inequality and exclusion in participatory media**
- **Race, gender, class antagonisms**
- Need for counterpublics to challenge dominant perspectives

**Counterpublics:**
- Defined as groups that contest hegemonic practices and meaning (Dahlberg)
- Facilitated by memetic media through bricolage, poaching, and vernacular creativity
- Essential for vibrant democracy according to Chantal Mouffe's agonism theory

**Examples of Counterpublics on Reddit:**
- /r/TumblrInAction: mocks feminist perspectives on Tumblr
- /r/SRSSucks: critiques vocal feminism in /r/ShitRedditSays
- /r/MensRights: advocates for men's rights, sometimes with misogynistic content.


#### Identity Antagonisms and Counterpublic Contestation

**Race, Gender, and Counterpublic Contestation**

**Policing of Participatory Media**:
- Collective conversation is political
- Discussion of race and gender antagonisms on participatory media (Reddit, 4chan, Tumblr, Imgur)

**Identity Antagonisms**:
- Participatory media historically associated with white, male, privileged
- Whiteness as "constructed centrality" - distributes whiteness through social spaces
- Feminine forms essentialized, while masculinity is dominant
- Cycle of normalizing partial forms of understanding

**Memetic Dimensions**:
- Memetic media can facilitate explicit identity antagonisms
- Race and gender minorities vocally antagonized as threatening outgroup
- Stereotypes spread memetically to dehumanize outsider identities
- Memetic logics guide the flow of these antagonisms, precluding counterpublic agonism.

**Figure 4.3**: Images perpetuating racial stereotypes, memetically applied to novel commentary.


##### Memetic racism and sexism perpetuate dehumanization of minorities and women in online communities.

**Dehumanization and Memetic Racism:**
- Stereotypes linking minority groups to animals or negative traits perpetuate dehumanization (African Americans, Jewish people, Middle Eastern nations)
- Hegemony exacerbated by cultural conversations on these images
- Minorities consistently marked for their minority status, while whites are not
- Racism is memetic and underpins its prevalence
- White centrality long evident in participatory collectives

**Images of Dehumanization:**
- Figure 4.3: Images antagonizing racial minorities (Barack Obama with simian features, stereotypical image of an elephant seal, and a quote from Star Wars)
- Figure 4.4: White male identity hailed in 4chan thread, minority groups presented as threatening mobs
- Prevalent stereotypes about African Americans used in responses to the thread

**Memetic Stereotypes and Gender:**
- Memetic stereotypes expressing misogyny persist (women belong in the kitchen)
- Images perpetuate gender roles, casting women as domestic caretakers and subjects of male dominance
- Female participants othered on 4chan's /b/ board, demanded to show their bodies or leave conversations
- Antagonistic and coercive process reifies female outsider status.

**Memetic Stereotypes and Majority Populations:**
- Both sides in discussions about differences between Europe and the US critiqued by stereotype
- White, male, and Western groups remain the constructed center and implied ingroup.


##### Exploring racial and gender stereotypes in online conversations and counterpublics.

**Impact of Stereotypes on Different Identities**
* Americans criticized for being unintelligent or overweight (Figure 4.4) but not dehumanizing racial stereotypes
* Europeans criticized for being weak or pretentious, often referencing World War II or moon landings
* Geographic stereotypes emphasized over dehumanizing racial stereototes
* White centrality remains intact in antagonistic conversations
* Successful Black Man macro: explicit connection between black man and deviance, requires modifier to be considered "normal"
* High Expectations Asian Father macro: racial minority and class comfort coexist, emphasis on education but race is marked
* Sheltering Suburban Mom macro: white subject, female gender marked while race remains unnamed centrality

**Less Antagonistic Stereotypes**
* Stock character macros spread between 2010 and 2012, still used in 2015
* Less explicitly antagonistic than figures 3-6 but memetically successful
* Danger lies in normalized representations reinforcing dominance of stereotype premise

**Counterpublic Contestation and Agonism**
* Everyday texts can challenge norms through counterpublic contestation
* Participatory media can facilitate safe spaces for marginalized identities
* Counterpublic spaces challenge hegemony by their existence
* Feminist bloggers create safe spaces, vocalize perspectives, resist silencing practices
* #YesAllWomen hashtag reappropriated memetic phrase "Not all men" to address gender violence.


#### Agonism and the Ambivalence of Irony

**Agonism and Ambivalence of Irony**

**Structures of Participation on Collectives:**
- Agonistic dimensions of public conversation complicated by ambiguities in tone and tenor
- Examples: 4chan, Reddit, Tumblr, Imgur

**Ironic, Adversarial Engagement:**
- Employed to commit great identity antagonisms and defend those antagonisms as "just joking"
- Popular among subcultural trolls and broader participatory media collectives
- Denigrates signs of sadness, frustration, or distress in public conversation

**Identity Antagonism and Lulz:**
- Playful vernacular creativity can reinforce oppressive ideologies and repress minority voice
- Scambaiting: exploits racial and ethnic identities to humiliate individuals (Nakamura, 2014)
- Denigrates counterarguments and reduces them to stereotype

**Counterpublic Contestations:**
- Humor, irony, and play can counter dominant antagonisms but also reinforce them
- Feminist bloggers use resonant humor and irony to counter harassment (Shaw, 2013)
- Counterpublic contestations employ aggressive adversarial humor to push against white, male centrality in participatory media

**/r/ShitRedditSays:**
- Known for mocking mainline Reddit sensibilities and embracing the "social justice warrior" label
- Accused of contributing nothing to productive public conversation by broader Reddit population.


##### Agonistic pluralism, Internet culture, online controversies, memetics, irony, Poe's Law.

**Agonistic Contestation and Counterpublic Spaces**

**Zizi Papacharissi (2004)**
- Civil conversation vs. polite behavior: distinction between the two
- Agonism achieves adversarial pluralism through acknowledging equal perspectives

**Adrienne Massanari (2015) and /r/ShitRedditSays**
- Parody and critique have counterpublic value
- Silencing practices threaten agonistic pluralism
- /r/ShitRedditSays as a counterpublic space:
  * Disregards open public debate
  * Focuses on hegemony critique within the subreddit
  * Employs criticism, irony, and play to counter dominant Reddit discourses

**Peter Dahlgren (2013)**
- Value in agonistic practices: richness and vibrancy of political discussion
- Adherence to "straightjacket" of rational speech can deflect civic engagement

**Memetic Play as Tools for Pluralistic Clash and Counterpublic Recuperation**
- Humor and play facilitate adversarial engagement
- Poe’s Law: distinguishing extremism from satire
  * Difficulty in parsing ironic antagonism from earnest exclusion
  * /b/ board on 4chan addresses this tension.

**Implications for Agonistic Pluralism:**
- Ambiguity around the term 'troll' and its impact on targets.
- Importance of recognizing the difference between playful antagonism and earnest exclusionary behaviors.


##### Ambiguous online discourse: Poe's Law, irony, and memetic communities.

**Memetic Collectives and Poe's Law**

**Blurred Boundaries**:
- Difficulty distinguishing ironic creative play from earnest hateful ideology in participatory media collectives
- Ambiguous stance towards identity antagonisms leads to ambiguous relationship to inequality

**Examples of Irony in Memetic Texts**:
- "Successful Black Man" image macro: 
    - Steeped in stereotype, but may undermine these stereotypes through play on stereotypes
    - Humorous incongruity creates an "irony marker" that helps readers understand the utterance as ironic
- Racial and gender epithets in memetic subcultures:
    - Employed with ambivalent intent, but could also further marginalize minority groups
    - Perpetuate a history of antagonism and dehumanization, even when used ironically

**Memetic Ideas as Fixed Premises**:
- Racism and sexism are memetic ideas themselves on many 4chan boards
- Participants creatively display novel expressions based on these fixed premises
- This can reinforce oppressive ideologies on a grander scale than narrowly racist associations


#### On Countertrolls and Counterpublics

**Antagonism: Race, Gender, and Counterpublic Contestation**

**Observations on Racist Talk in Memetic Subcultures**:
- Trolls' use of racist language does not prove they are racists, but it is observable and perpetuates white, male centrality in participatory media.
- Identity exclusion undermines agonistic pluralism and public engagement.

**Countertrolls and Counterpublics**:
- Memetic subcultures comprise a mixed media ecology with both inclusive and exclusive vernacular.
- Antagonistic practices, even if playful or ironic, perpetuate inequality and undermine public discourse.
- Examples:
  - /r/Creepshots was replaced by /r/CandidFashionPolice, which presents the same content with more "civil" titles.
  - /r/FatPeopleHate was banned and replaced by /r/FatPersonHate, which continues the antagonistic discourse.
- These counterpublics can also create safe spaces for marginalized perspectives to contest dominant narratives.

**Conclusion**:
- The danger is not just "trolling" or "lulz" but how these communicative norms silence marginalized voices.
- The next chapter will explore the potential of memetic media for vibrant public discourse in the midst of everyday antagonisms.


### 5 Voice Pop and Populism in Public Commentary. Participation and the Occupation1

- Allegations that proceeds were not donated to the movement
- Criticized for commercializing activism

**Arguments Against Pop Cultural Iconography in OWS**
- Some argue it undermines the movement's aims and delegitimizes participants
- Reduces commentary on significant political issues to mere pastiche
- Satirical critiques of Anonymous and memetic media, portraying protestors as ineffective or "toothless"

**Contrasting Views on Pop Culture in Public Commentary**
- Some see it as cheapened pastiche that undermines civic engagement
- Others argue popular genres allow for richer participation in public conversation.


##### The power of memetic media in agonistic political commentary through popular culture examples like "Pepper Spray Cop".

**Vernacular Creativity and Political Commentary**

**Memetic Media**:
- Popular mode of public conversation
- Dependent on everyday creative expression for leisure, activism, and politics
- Can be reappropriated from their original purpose

**Vernacular Creativity in Agonistic Politics**:
- Transforms populist and popular into explicitly political commentary
- Central to agonistic engagement between political adversaries
- Requires participants to craft resonant messages that appeal to both the public and themselves

**Example: "Pepper Spray Cop" Meme**:
- Inspired by a photo of police lieutenant pepper-spraying OWS protestors at UC Davis in 2011
- Resonated with the public due to the presence of media coverage
- Sparked extensive memetic remixes, where Pike's image was inserted into new contexts
- Used for populist commentary, portraying him targeting cultural innocents or antiauthoritarian heroes


#### Polyvocality and Public Conversation

**Polyvocality and Public Conversation**

**Prevalent Political Narrative**:
- "Pepper Spray Cop" images portray innocents and heroes oppressed and attacked by an instrument of soulless governmental control
- Multiple moments from public history and popular culture combine to form mediated, polyvocal commentary

**Humorous Commentary and Political Culture**:
- Humorous commentary strips away artifice, highlights inconsistencies, and challenges the authority of official political discourse
- Offers pleasurable ports of entry to current political topics, contributing to the evolution of mediated political culture

**Memetic Logics and Public Voice**:
- Memetic logics facilitate public commentary surrounding OWS, empowering diverse arguments about the movement
- Helped carry the OWS message across participatory media, inspiring traditional media attention

**Polyvocality in Action**:
- At the height of the OWS protests, citizens with wide opinions employed memetic logics to make diverse arguments about the movement
- Memetic media were agilely employed to engage in counterpublic civic talk, sharing their OWS support outside traditional media framing

**Polyvocal Expressions and Conversations**:
- The content most shared on OWS Facebook pages was not directly framed by those in charge of the movement
- This memetic spread reduced the power of movements to shape their own frames, but also exemplified the "very talkative media culture" essential to polyvocal public participation
- Memetic media allowed for active citizenship and agile communicative tools, facilitating diverse arguments about OWS


##### Occupy Wall Street: Polyvocal Memetic Engagement and the "We are the 99 Percent" Meme. memes, Occupy Wall Street, participatory media, public conversations, income inequality.

**Populist Distinctions and OWS**
- **Distinctions between "99 Percent" and "1 Percent"**: Invoked in memetic phrases like "We are the 99 Percent", reflecting disproportionate opportunity, power, influence, resources, security, and agency for those at the top
- These distinctions became a source of support for OWS through the "99 Percent" meme

**Critiques of OWS**
- Critical civic talk coexisted alongside supportive comments: Memetic images dismissed OWS protestors as **hippies**, **whiny children**, or **hypocrites**
- Critics argued that OWS protesters were **anticapitalist** while taking advantage of capitalism, **revolutionary without any real consequence**, and **complaining about the problems of an entitled leisure class**
- These critiques spread via participatory media, embodied conversations, and pundits, interconnecting with broader conversations during the height of protests

**Polyvocality in Participatory Media**
- Participatory media can inspire polyvocal engagement with public issues
- However, users may seek opinion-confirming information, creating "echo chambers"
- DeLuca et al. (2012) found that right and left-leaning political blogs covered OWS as separate events
- Croeser and Highfield (2014) observed that Twitter helped connect physical protests to mediated messaging but required protestors to address both insiders and adversaries

**The "99 Percent" Memetic Phrase**
- The phrase "I am the 99 Percent" gained prominence during OWS protests, creating a sense of inclusion and majority
- It spread through participatory media networks like Tumblr and was featured on protest signs, hashtags, chants, and images
- The fixed premise for remixing this meme was made explicit by its curators: Take a picture holding a sign describing your situation, write "I am the 99 Percent", and provide a link to Occupy Wall Street's website.


#### A More Vibrant Tapestry

**The Relationship Between Pop-Savvy Media and Polyvocal Political Conversation**

**Polyvocalism in OWS Conversations**:
- OWS conversations were articulated vibrantly through memetic logics
- Aesthetic practices and humorous tone common in memetic media carried populist perspectives about the movement
- Pop texts and pop networks intertwined as individuals crafted commentary from everyday sources

**Memetic Logics and Polyvocal Commentary**:
- Memetic logics enabled OWS conversations to be widely reappropriated
- Not all appropriations shared on sites were "productive" commentary, but they contributed to multiturn commentary
- Ambiguous uses of OWS memes provided a space for creative play and political participation

**The Importance of Humor in Public Commentary**:
- Memetic practices enable a type of freedom, especially in repressive environments
- Interpersonally driven, viral narratives can be powerful in shaping public discourse

**Polyvocal Assertions and Public Debate**:
- OWS memes spawned intricate text-based discussion on the arguments they presented
- The spread of polyvocal assertions through image memes inspired complex public conversation
- Popular culture and polyvocal conversation were fundamental to the memetic dimensions of OWS

**Conclusion**:
- The polyvocal assertions of mediated citizens intertwined, amplifying their voices in public debate
- However, unequal power can taint voice with silence, highlighting the need for continued efforts towards truly polyvocal conversation.

#### Complicating the Culture Industries

**Little's Glimpse of Fame and Memetic Participation**

**Background:**
- Little's case highlights ambivalent dimensions of mediated participation
- Discussion focuses on pitfalls and promises of social conversations made up of memetic logics

**Memetic Media and Culture Industries:**
- Extensions of traditional cultural industries into the realm of users
- Memetic media can add democratic voice but also be appropriated for hegemonic marginalization
- Old questions emerge anew in hypermemetic media ecology

**Internet Famous:**
- Individuals who have gained fame or notoriety via participatory media

**Obama's Engagement with Memetic Moments:**
- Playful engagement with memetic moments and collectives during his presidency
- Memetic expressions used for political messaging on social media and web video series.


##### Obama's use of memetic media and its impact on public figures' privacy in participatory culture

**Impact of Participatory Media on Politics and Privacy**

**Obama's Use of Memetic Media**:
- Obama uses participatory media platforms for political strategy without being obviously strategic
- Appropriation of existing culture industries, from traditional to emergent participatory media
- Generativity of memetic participation becomes a publicity tool in the Obama toolbox

**Memetic Media and Internet Fame**:
- Memetic media can make citizens public or amplify small public audiences into massive ones
- Individuals made "internet famous" may embrace their alter egos and turn it into established personas
  - Examples: Blake Boston ("Scumbag Steve"), Overly Attached Girlfriend, Bad Luck Brian
- Collective attention can leave real individuals in its wake
- Tensions between public identity that can be controlled versus collective attributions on participatory media

**The Downsides of Generativity**:
- Populist and democratic ability to reappropriate widely and create something new
- Vernacular creativity can also leave real individuals in its wake, causing potential harm or invasiveness
  - Example: Inviting "Tron Guy" to ROFLCon, a meme-related conference.


#### Gatekeeping the Open Internet

**Conversation: Cultural Participation and the Culture Industries**

**Old Notions of Celebrity and Privacy**:
- Elmore's framing of Little's story is sympathetic, but based on old inequalities
- Favorable attention for individuals like Little comes from problematic identity politics
- Other internet famous figures have not been as lucky with unsolicited attention

**Tension Between Participatory Media and Traditional Culture Industries**:
- Participatory media allow individuals to compromise privacy more than traditional institutions
- Old notions of celebrity, publicity, and privacy need to adapt to new social conversations and technological platforms

**Gatekeeping the Open Internet**:
- Even when ordinary people become celebrities through participatory media, they remain within a system controlled by mass media
- YouTube success is measured by ability to pass through gatekeepers of traditional culture industries (e.g., recording contracts, film festivals)
- Participatory media are open enough to encourage expression outside traditional gatekeepers, but also guide collectives through platforms

**Example: Double Rainbow Guy**:
- YouTube user Hungrybear9562's "Double Rainbow" video was relatively unknown until Jimmy Kimmel shared it on Twitter
- Kimmel's tweet helped the video become a viral hit, with over 41 million views by 2015
- Traditional media gatekeepers played a role in amplifying the memetic spread of the video

**Commercialization of Memetic Participation**:
- Culture industries capitalize on publicity and celebrity in participatory media
- Influence of culture industries becomes more apparent as participatory media evolve


##### Commercial appropriation of memetic content in internet culture and its impact on participatory media.

**Memetic Media Ecology and Culture Industries**

**Background:**
- Original conference on internet culture sponsored by Barbarian Group, an interactive marketing agency (379)
- Changing role of "internet fame" in commercial industries

**Agents and Lawsuits:**
- Ben Lashes: Grumpy Cat's agent, represented other internet famous figures
- Commercial appropriation of memetic content by brands
  - Lawsuits against content creators for unauthorized use (Robertson 2013)

**Ambivalent Commercial Appropiation:**
- Open sharing leading to commercial exploitation
- Examples: Grumpy Cat t-shirt slogans, meme jokes in brand social media, Delta flight safety video

**Memetic Practices and Culture Industries:**
- Brands capitalize on viral moments for promotion (Maskeroni 2015)
- Dr Pepper Snapple Group's collection of image macros featuring McKayla Maroney (Elliott 2013)

**Surplus Labor vs. Buzz across the Internet:**
- Fuchs argues against participatory media as a commodity (219)
- Commercial organizations benefit from user-generated content

**Impact on Public Conversation:**

**Key Figures:**
- Ben Lashes: Grumpy Cat's agent
- McKayla Maroney: gymnast endorsed by Dr Pepper Snapple Group
- Christopher "moot" Poole: founder of 4chan.


##### Exploring memetic culture: Participation, authenticity, and commercialism in digital media.

**Memetic Media and Cultural Participation**

**Key Arguments by Coddington:**
- The "communicative commons of society" should be accessible without payment or access requirements for all, not privately owned or controlled by a class (221).
- Memetic participation can facilitate both critique and hegemony in commercial media ecology.
- Reddit's system affords political publicity and viral marketing as well as watchdog subreddits for critiquing corporate content.
- YouTube's commercial dimensions are not clear cut; professional and amateur production, or commercial and community practices, should not be distinguished based on industrial logics (Burgess & Green, 2009).

**Attribution and Authenticity in Memetic Media:**
- Memetic logics can facilitate the spread of both accurate and inaccurate information.
- Existing culture industries and publicity are concerns due to memetic conversations' speed and open participation.
- Poe's Law, lulz, anonymity, and diverse communicative goals make it difficult to parse earnestness, satire, or deceit in memetic media.

**Examples of Memetic Media:**
- 4chan's /x/ board: paranormal discussions with threads on Miley Cyrus replacement theories, time travel, and 9/11 conspiracies.
- /r/MURICA subreddit: a house for hyperbolic American patriotism where it's hard to distinguish earnestness from satire.
- CBS report on Zayn Malik leaving One Direction featuring teenagers' emotional reactions, which was criticized as an ironic post (2015).


##### The power of memes: Authenticity vs. resonance in participatory media.

**Memetic Media: Discursive Truth vs. Actual Facts**

**CBS Video on Teenage Reaction to Pop Culture Event**
- Poster's contribution was satirical, met with playful barbs on Reddit thread
- Charge that original poster wasn't the teenager from CBS video
- Memetic dimensions resonated more than specific factuality for CBS and primary audiences

**Obama's /r/AMA Thread (2012)**
- Verification consisted of tweet and photo from official account, did not prove authenticity
- Q&A could have been copied from campaign website or written by staffer
- Discursive truth of president "participating" on Reddit significant, whether or not he was behind keyboard

**Bad Luck Brian Memetic Image**
- Original photo never appeared in school yearbook
- Friend uploaded rejected image to Reddit, memetic resonance overshadowed original intent
- Decontextualization and recontextualization lead to misrepresentation and potential deceit in participatory networks

**#BringBackOurGirls Hashtag Campaign (2014)**
- Photos shared on Twitter not of kidnapped Nigerian girls or even same country
- Sentiment resonated despite incorrect association with actual events
- Raises questions of representation and misrepresentation in mediated participation

**Quotations Shared Across Participatory Media**
- Often share inspiring or apt maxims from famous figures
- Memetically healthy but factually dubious when recontextualized
- Resonance tied to discursive truth beyond specific facts
- Quote attributed to MLK Jr. in the wake of Osama bin Laden's death was half accurate, spread due to resonance and ease of amplification by large social media influencers like Penn Jillette.


#### Public Conversations and Participatory Media

**Memetic Media and Cultural Participation**

**Cultural Participation and the Culture Industries:**
- Interdependence between memetic media and culture industries
- Texts created within cultural contexts, governed by rules
- Example: Chris Hadfield's cover of "Space Oddity"
  - Removed from YouTube due to copyright issues
  - Renewed permission for uploading after petitioning Bowie's representatives

**Public Conversations and Participatory Media:**
- Memetic media ecology complicates issues of privacy, credibility, attribution, and ownership
- Debate over representation and appropriation continues
- Generativity of public participants is necessary despite potential risks
- Public conversations evidence uneasy coexistence with culture industries

**Impact on Public Conversations:**
- Memetic media under the purview of brands, managers, merchandisers
- Used for campaigning, protest, subject to gatekeeping and control.

**Conclusion:**
- Memetic media built on memetic logics, implemented through vernacular and grammar
- Facilitates both antagonism and voice in public conversations
- Ultimate assessment of this meme world to follow.

#### The Ethics of Visual Representation and Reproduction

**Ethics of Visual Representation and Reproduction**

**Background:**
- Reflection on ethical implications of memetic media work
- Evolution of perspectives on visual representation
- Prevalence of visual representations and researcher's role

**Early Work:**
- Cavalier attitude towards reproducing visual material
- Ignorance of role in spreading likenesses or intellectual property without consent or attribution

**Considerations for Visual Research:**
- Privacy concerns: individuals with reasonable expectation of privacy should not have their likeness reproduced without expressed consent
- Confidential information protection
- Blurry line between public and private content

**Ethical Guidelines:**
- Association of Internet Researchers, International Visual Sociology Association, Economic and Social Research Council, National Centre for Research Methods, Society for Cinema and Media Studies, International Communication Association

**Privacy Concerns:**
- Protect confidential information
- Consent, confidentiality, and anonymity in image reproduction
- Reasonable expectation of privacy vs. public figure status

**Decisions Regarding Inclusions:**
- Focus on reproducing images from popular media source materials or public figures to be considered "public"
- Avoid reproducing images that disrupt seclusion, disclose embarrassing facts, put figures in a false light, or unreasonably appropriate their likeness
- Remove some other private citizens' likenesses as part of ethical choice about reasonable expectation of privacy.

**Stock Characters:**
- Reproduced due to their popular media source material, public figure status, or origin as stock photos, which are produced for spreading.

**Difficult Ethical Choice:**
- Balancing the need to protect privacy with the public nature of certain images in research.


##### Ethical dilemmas in using public images and respecting privacy in research.

**Image Reproduction and Ethics**

**Consent for Reproduction**:
- Consent may not be required for images captured in "public places"
- Images from public gatherings or events may be defensible for inclusion in a book, even if they depict "private" citizens

**Participatory Media Sites**:
- If participatory media sites are metaphorical "public spaces", the faces of individuals in "99 Percent" images may be considered public
- Decision to crop images was a compromise due to the nature of the texts being analyzed

**Privacy and Representation**:
- Decisions about whose identity to reveal vs. protect required judgment calls, striving to balance insightful analysis with ethical considerations
- Opted not to reproduce likenesses of protestors, but included name and likeness of UC Davis police officer John Pike as a public figure
- Avoided reproducing "Ridiculously Photogenic Guy" photo to protect privacy of other individuals in the background
- Attribution decisions balanced privacy concerns with crediting creative expression

**Legal and Ethical Considerations**:
- Legal and ethical ambiguities around reproducing visual content, both within and outside the United States
- "Fair use" as a symbolic "master frame" for open media reproduction, but also a complicated concept
- Guides from Society for Cinema and Media Studies and International Communication Association provided helpful guidance on fair use
- Uncertainty around retaining rights from Kanye West's label, Wes Anderson's studio, or the tumblog for "99 Percent" images
