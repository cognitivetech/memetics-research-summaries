# Studies In Violence Mimesis And Culture William A Johnsen The Mimetic Brain 2016

>  The discovery of mirror neurons in the 1990s led to an explosion of research and debate about the imitative capacities of the human brain. Some herald a paradigm shift on the order of DNA in biology, while others remain skeptical. In this revolutionary volume Jean- Michel Oughourlian shows how the hypotheses of René Girard can be combined with the insights of neuroscientists to shed new light on the “mimetic brain.”\
> Offering up clinical studies and a complete reevaluation of classical psychiatry, Oughourlian explores the interaction among reason, emotions, and imitation and reveals that rivalry—the blind spot in contemporary neuroscientific understandings of imitation—is a misunderstood driving force behind mental illness. Oughourlian’s analyses shake the very foundations of psychiatry as we know it and open up new avenues for both theoretical research and clinical practice. - [Studies in violence mimesis and culture William A Johnsen_The mimetic brain](https://www.amazon.com/Mimetic-Studies-Violence-Mimesis-Culture/dp/1611861896?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

### A personal journey into mimetic theory and its application to psychology and psychiatry, inspired by René Girard.

**Background:**
- Cartesian thought struggled to integrate influence of psychic torments, feelings, movements of soul on body (soma), leading to theoretical problem
- Jean Delay's statement: "Psychic disorders organize themselves and little by little organicize themselves"
- Psychological and psychopathological problems were also anthropological and philosophical issues
- Encounter with René Girard in 1972 led to new perspective on mimetic desire and sociological hypothesis of scapegoat mechanism

**Author's Journey:**
- Finished doctorate on drug addiction, seeking understanding of violence (1972)
- Met René Girard, admired his theories, started reading Violence and the Sacred
- Decided to meet him in Buffalо, New Yорk (spring 1973)
- Realized René was a genius, developed friendship and working relationship
- Introduced to Michel Serres, who became friend and mentor
- Introduced to Benoît Chantre, helped with writing Thе Genesis of Desire (2007)

**Girard's Theory:**
- Mimetic desire: psychological hypothesis
- Scapegoat mechanism: sociological hypothesis
- Foundation of culture: immolation of primordial emissary victim

**Impact on Author:**
- New perspective on psychology and psychiatry
- Reading all things related to mimetic studies in these fields

**Approach:**
- Focus on fundamental hypotheses (mimetic desire, scapegoat mechanism) instead of singular cases
- Aim for a more scientific approach, better insight into psychopathological situations
- Understanding that each human being is unique but generalizations can still be useful.


## Introduction

**Introduction to Brains: First, Second, and Third**

**Background:**
- Each human being has only one brain
- Anatomical and historical recognition of various brain structures
- Past beliefs about judgment and emotions

**First Brain (Rational):**
- Cortex: seat of memory, thinking, and reasoning
- Discovery by neurologists
- Divided into conscious and unconscious parts
- Freud's belief in memory
- Called the "first brain" for historical and anatomical reasons

**Second Brain (Emotional):**
- Discovery by Antonio Damasio
- Archaic brain, limbic system
- Includes emotional intelligence
- Importance of relationship and reciprocity
- Mirror neuron system discovery in the mid-1990s
- Identified as part of both rational and emotional brains
- Impacts emotional and cognitive functions
- Proposed as the "second brain"

**Third Brain (Relational):**
- Introducing mimetic brain or third brain concept
- Human beings equipped with a neuronal apparatus for relationships
- Mirror system puts individuals in prerational resonance with others
- Discovered mirror neurons in both human and monkey brains
- Relationships and imitation are the driving force of emotional and cognitive functions
- Gallese's hypothesis: higher order brain functions depend on basic mirroring mechanisms
- Human thinking and reasoning may stem from prerational, prelinguistic simulations.


### A comparison of René Girard's theory of mimetic desire with relational psychoanalysis. The author discusses the impact of early experiences and current relationships on personal development.

**Mimetic Desire and Relational Psychoanalysis**

**Overview:**
- René Girard: first thinker to connect imitation and rivalry
- Emphasis on relationships, but differences with relational psychoanalysis
  - Focus on present relationships and mimetic rivalry
  - Rejects "reenactment" as an illusion

**Background:**
- Various psychologists/psychiatrists fascinated by human attraction since Mesmer
- Representation of a distinguished psychoanalyst's story about early childhood experiences and masturbation
  - Child was not doomed by past events alone
  - Boris Cyrulnik's work on resiliency supports this idea

**Relational Psychoanalysis:**
- Emphasizes relationships, but various theories
- Representation of a child who was cared for by a wet nurse and her technique to keep him quiet through masturbation
  - Participants discussed potential negative outcomes for the child
  - The psychoanalyst revealed that he was the child in question

**Mimetic Desire:**
- Universal mechanism of rivalry in relationships
- Influences current behaviors without realization
- Can be an obstacle to positive development, not just past events

**First Part:**
- Overview of René Girard's theory of mimetic desire
  - Deceit, Desire, and the Novel
- Spinoza and Freud's ideas anticipating Girard's work
  - Mimetic desire as driving force in human psychology
- Scientific confirmation from contemporary researchers

**Second Part:**
- Interdividual psychology developed by René Girard and the author
- Author's ideas about mimetic reciprocity, hypnosis, and temporality of mimetic desire.


## Part 1. Towards a Mimetic Anthropology

Desire forms bodies without organs on the plane of consistency; distinguish healthy from cancerous or empty ones.

Understand identity of effects, continuity of genera, and totality through an abstract machine, connecting and integrating desires.


### Chapter 1. Contagious Desire

**René Girard's Theory of Mimetic Desire**

**Discovery of Mimetic Desire**:
- Desire is mimetic, copied, inspired, generated, suggested, and produced by the other's desire
- The "other" can be a close, known person (internal mediator) or a historical/distant personage or cultural entity (external mediator)
- Difference between internal and external mediation:
  - Internal mediator can become a rival, whereas external mediator does not engender rivalry

**Mimetic Desire in Literature**:
- Girard analyzed works of great novelists like Cervantes, Flaubert, Stendhal, and Dostoevsky
- Examples:
  - **Don Quixote**: Surrendered desire to Amadis of Gaul, model
  - **Bovaryism**: Flaubert's heroes imitate the "model" they have decided to be
  - **Stendhal's vanity**: Desire borrowed from others, not drawn from own resources

**Feelings Toward the Model/Mediator**:
- Model may rebuff or block the subject's desire, leading to feelings of reverence and malice (hatred)
- Mimetic nature of jealousy and envy

**Desire as an Illusion**:
- The mediator's prestige is imparted to the desired object, conferring illusory value
- Desire is a "triumph of suggestion over impression" - what the other makes us see overtakes actual experience

**Prohibition and Rivalry in Desire**:
- Desire is triggered and reinforced by prohibition, which is manifestation of the power of the rival
- Desire and rivalry are coextensive and inseparable


#### Mimetic Desire: Rivalry, Imitation, and Metaphysical Longing.

**Mimetic Desire and Metamorphosis**

**Characteristics of Mimetic Desire:**
- Aimed at the mediator's being, not just their possessions
- Desire to be initiated into a new life
- Imitation of models, even if they are insignificant or unattainable
- Metaphysical desire: aiming for the model's essence beyond their physical attributes
- Disappointment upon possession of object, leading to seeking another mediator
- Double meditation: wanting to possess someone else's object but not have it in their hands
- Coquetry: division and role-playing games in relationships

**Effects of Mimetic Desire:**
- Rivalry, conflict, and violence in modern world due to abundance of models and rivals
- Happiness is elusive as we are "vain" or susceptible to mimetic desire
- Negative feelings like jealousy, envy, and resentment are common results

**Mimetic Desire in Literature:**
- Proust: desire for new life through initiation by mediator
- Stendhal's vaniteux: reduction of sexual pleasure due to metaphysical desire
- Dostoevsky: absence of pleasure, deep misery due to intense mimetic desires

**Double Meditation:**
- Three corners occupied by lover, beloved, and self
- Seduction through indifference and dissimulation in relationships
- Politics of desire based on dissimulation and struggle for victory between lovers.


#### Mimetic Desire: Examples of Rivalry and Jealousy in Clinical Cases

**Mimetic Desire**

**Illusion of Superiority**:
- Illusion created by making other's objects/being more desirable than our own
- Collapses once we defeat the rival and appropriate the desired object or sphere

**Pathological Manifestations**:
- Vanity, envy, jealousy, and rivalry
- Examples:
  - Patient shouting about doctor eating her raisin bun
  - Billionaire obsessing over stolen old car

**Differences in Culture and Social Class**:
- Needs vs. desires
- Rich people's symptoms different from poor people's

**Mimetic Desire in Psychiatric Practice**:
- Rivalry is the clinical manifestation, not imitation of others' desires
- Patients deny their own desire being copied from others

**Case Study: Mrs. H.**:
- Left husband for another man, then realized he had a mistress
- Felt intensely jealous and wanted to eliminate the other woman
- Therapist encouraged her to embrace the "delicious" feeling of jealousy
- Later returned, complaining that husband was less passionate, suspecting he was still with the Vietnamese woman


#### Mimetic Desire: Understanding Possession and Jealousy through Precursors Spinoza and Girard

**Mimetic Desire: Precursors and Manifestations**

**Mimetic Desire:**
- Complication of complicity, attraction, affection, and love
- Variable proportions of rivalry, repulsion, and aggression

**Manifestation of Desire:**
- Can be directed at what the other has or is
- Extreme cases may result in possession

**Case Study: Micheline's Story**
1. Micheline was brought to a therapist by her girlfriend Sandra due to alcoholism and depression.
2. Micheline had fallen deeply in love with a Creole girl named Marguerite who took all her money and abandoned her.
3. Micheline began treating Sandra sadistically, leading the therapist to believe it was Micheline who was being sadistic.
4. Through mimetic analysis, the therapist revealed that Marguerite possessed Micheline, making her do to Sandra everything Marguerite would have done to her.
5. Understanding her rival as the true enemy helped Micheline begin to drink less and treat Sandra better.

**Precursors of Mimetic Theory:**
1. **René Girard**: Focused on mimetic desire in his thought and work
2. Unexpected Precursor: **Baruch Spinoza**
3. Connection between Girard and Spinoza noted by scholars
4. In Book III of Ethics, Spinoza expresses the concept of mimetic desire in propositions 27 to 39
5. Proposition 31: "If we imagine that someone loves, desires or hates something we ourselves love, desire, or hate, we shall thereby love, desire or hate it with greater constancy"
6. Children laugh or cry simply because they see others laugh or cry (corollary of proposition 32)


### Chapter 2. The Precursors

**Freud's Parameters of Desire**

**First Parameter**:
- Subject never chooses a woman free from ties to men
- Woman is often already married or involved in a relationship
- This can be explained by the persistence of rival desire to tear woman away from her current partner

**Second Parameter**:
- Desired woman is never a virtuous one
- Women known for being "easy" or prostitutes attract many lovers, who are driven by jealousy and the need to possess the woman

**Third Parameter**:
- The value of a woman is determined by her sexual integrity, but neurotic men consider these women as "love objects of the highest value"
- Desires become aggravated when concentrated on a single woman

**Fourth Parameter**:
- Tendency to "save the beloved"
- Not about bringing the beloved back to virtue, but eliminating all rivals and keeping the desired body for oneself

**Unconscious Mimetic Reality**:
- Freud's psychoanalytic interpretation remains unconscious in relation to mimetic theory
- Mimetic reading appears simpler, more scientific, and enlightening


### Chapter 3. Some Contemporaries

**Contemporaries of René Girard: Developmental Psychology and Andrew Meltzoff**
* In the second half of the 20th century, contemporaries in various disciplines provided support for René Girard's theory of mimetic desire through their experiments.
* Newborn imitation research by Meltzoff and Moore (1977): newborns responded differently to tongue protrusion depending on whether the lips were involved or not.
* Overview of work by independent laboratories confirmed early imitation in newborns (Meltzoff and Moore, 1997).
* Hypothesis that observation and execution of human actions are coded in the same neuronal structure (Meltzoff and Moore, 1977).
* Connection between self and other functional from birth, no need for long learning process (Meltzoff, 2008).
* Importance of gaze in infants' development (Brooks and Meltzoff, 2002).
* Infants follow movements with greater frequency when experimenter's eyes are open (Brooks and Meltzoff, 2002).
* "Like-me" hypothesis: imitation focused on intention and goal of gesture (Meltzoff, 1985).
* Autistic children may have difficulties with imitation (controversial issue, Gernsbacher, 2007).

**Mirror Neurons**
* Discovery by Giacomo Rizzolatti's team in Parma (1996) due to progress in medical imagery and development of PET scan and functional MRI.
* Neurons consume more radioactive glucose when performing an action, making it visible on the PET scan.
* Particular area of the brain corresponding to the observed action lights up during recording (Rizzolatti et al., 1996).


#### Mirror neurons: Understanding others through brain mirroring and empathy

**Mirror Neurons and Embodied Simulation**

**Observation of Actions**:
- Brain activity of observer matches that of person performing action
- "Mirror neurons" responsible for this reflection and response to observed activity
- Observed actions trigger mirror activity in observer's brain
- Humans, as well as other primates, have a fundamental mechanism for experiential understanding of others' minds
- This is called "intentional attunement" or "embodied simulation"

**Shared Neural States**:
- Human brains transform the observed person into "another self"
- Establishes groundwork for empathy and familiarity with others
- Mirror neurons trigger stronger activity when observing human beings rather than inanimate objects or robots

**Learning and Imitation**:
- Imitation is the foundation of interhuman relations
- Mirror neurons are at the origin of empathy, decoding, and sharing emotions/feelings
- Innate mimetic mechanism allows brain to learn, understand, and integrate new information from others
- Learning is a result of mimeticism and mimetic desire when the model remains a model

**Unfinished Actions**:
- Observer's mirror system can guess the other's intention, even if the action is unfinished
- Models itself on the other's desire or intention, even when the object is hidden


## Part 2. A Psychiatry of the Three Brains

Desire forms Bodies without Organs (BwO), creating a plane of consistency that distinguishes healthy from unhealthy desires, emptied or cancerous bodies. The abstract machine and assemblages on this plane facilitate connections among desires and ensure their continuity, preventing the dominance of diseased BwOs.


### Chapter 4. Interdividual Psychology

**Interdividual Psychology: Mimesis and Universal Forces**

**Background:**
- Witnessed birth of interdividual psychology theory in the late 1960s
- René Girard, Guy Lefort, and author forged term "interdividual psychology" (1978)
- Focus on relationships instead of individuals

**Mimetic Desire:**
- Invisible force leading to imitation and learning
- First mode of entering into relation with others
- Hypothesis of mimesis: a force enabling gesture imitation, language acquisition, memory development

**Universal Mimesis:**
- Connection to Mesmer's fluid theory (eighteenth century)
  - Magnetic force playing fundamental role in human connection and pathology
  - Replaced by suggestion without magnetism being effective
- Comparison of universal gravitation and mimesis: prevention of fusion through movement

**Desire and Movement:**
- Desire as movement leading humans to orbit around one another
- Child's detachment from maternal breast through mimetically suggested objects

**Suggestion:**
- Connection to hypnotic phenomena and contagion of ideas/feelings (Mesmer)
- Replaced magnetism with suggestion in understanding psychological reality.


### Chapter 5. Psychological Time and the Nodal Points N and N

**Psychological Time and the Nodal Points N and N'**

**Understanding Nodal Points**:
- Self at nodal point N cannot survive without being persuaded it owns its desire
- Forgetting the otherness of the desire that constituted it, considering it as own
- Active misrecognition, but remaining peaceful and nonadversarial

**Constitution of the Self in Physical Time**:
- Linear vector from past to future
- Desire D mimetically elicits birth of desire d
- Birth of self s at nodal point N
- Unfolding in physical time has no psychological reality

**Psychological Time (Time of Memory)**:
- Reversed process unfolds at nodal point N'
- Desire d asserts anteriority over desire D
- Self s lays claim to possession of object of both desires d and D
- Constitutes a new time - psychological time, the only meaningful time for human subjectivity

**Physical vs. Psychological Time**:
- Physical time has no psychological reality, but is accessible to intelligence
- Memories become present in psychotherapy, not correlated to physical time
- "Time regained" in Proustian sense is not physical time, but sensation, emotion, and images

**Universal Mimesis and Memory**:
- Attraction proportional to mass and inversely proportional to distance
- Memory obeys laws of quantum physics
- Two phenomena resembling quantum physics:
  - A photon can be in two places at once
  - Present consciousness can influence past memory representation

**Transformative Recognition**:
- Recognition of otherness of "my" desire can modify all misrecognitions
- Leads to wisdom, unifying time and giving a glimpse of eternity
- Nodal points N and N' are coextensive, cannot exist without each other


#### Psychological time, desire, imitation, otherness, self, recognition, Platonic imitation, ownership, being, mimesis conflictiva, violence.

**Psychological Time: The Inversion of Physical Time**
- Conclusion: psychological time has no meaning; future corresponds to nothing, only past related by memory is considered real
- Past, psychological time is inverse of physical time
- Realization that memory reports are reverse of actuality leads to peace and wisdom (recognition of otherness of desire)
- Misrecognition leads to all psychopathological syndromes for neurotics and psychotics

**Memory: Function of Forgetting**
- Memory has essential function: forgetting genesis of desire and self, enabling existence with attributes
- During hypnotic trance, hypnotizer's desire creates imitated self with all its attributes

**Imitation: Four Kinds**
1. **Appearance**: Platonic imitation - imitating form; information added or subtracted from model
2. **Belongings**: Gesture of appropriation and ownership, source of conflict and escalation (mimesis confl ictiva)
3. **Being**: Identification with model for appeasement and conflict avoidance
4. **Desire**: Imitated desire causes identical desire to bloom in disciple; adversarial or nonadversarial evolution depends on proximity to model and nature of desired object

**Myself is an Other**
- Desire that constitutes self is the other's desire
- Human condition saturated with otherness, difficult to accept
- Misrecognition is initial and necessary for self-maintenance
- Recognition is a difficult, initiatory enterprise leading to mental health, happiness, and wisdom.


### Chapter 6. The Three Brains

**The Three Brains: Cognitive and Rational vs. Emotional and Affective**

**Background:**
- Ancient Egyptians believed heart was seat of perception, cognition, and soul
- Aristotle thought brain's function was to cool heart's passions
- Leonardo da Vinci located perception and cognition in ventricular cavities
- Descartes believed soul and body interacted at pineal gland

**Modern Understanding:**
- Brain became focus of study in late 17th century with term "neurology"
- Perception, movement, cognition, memory studied as brain functions
- First brain: cognitive and rational, seat of intelligence, IQ, comprehension, reason, judgment

**Limitations:**
- Philosophical tradition focused on independence of brain in thought
- Freud established distinction between conscious and unconscious memory

**Discovery of Emotional Intelligence:**
- Antonio Damasio: existence and importance of second brain (limbic brain)
- Mirror neurons offer explanation for empathy, interconnectedness

**Historical Perspective:**
- Ancient Greeks identified emotional dimension in sexual organs or female bodies
- Later attributed to demon or unconscious mind
- Freudian unconscious: active repression of traumatic memories

**Modern Philosophical Critique:**
- Jeremy Rifkin: empathy crucial to human nature, opposed to traditional philosophical views
- Humans as social animals rather than solitary beings.


#### Understanding the emotional brain's role in desire, social interaction, and self-formation through mirror neurons and the limbic system.

**The Second Brain: Emotional and Social Intelligence**

**Relevance of Limbic Brain Research**:
- Mirror neurons and mirror system present in limbic brain, likely explaining emotional and social intelligence
- Discovery of the second brain credited to Joseph Le Doux, Antonio Damasio, Daniel Goleman, and others

**Emotional and Rational Minds**:
- **Goleman**: Two semi-independent faculties - emotional and rational minds
- Coordinated but balance can be thrown off when passions flare up

**Phineas Gage Case Study**:
- Damasio's discovery of the emotional brain through study of Phineas Gage
- Unusual patient who underwent a skull injury in 1848, resulting in personality change and emotional dysregulation

**The Second Brain: Limbic System**:
- Includes prefrontal cortex, ventromedial region of the frontal lobe, hypothalamus, gyrus, amygdala, and structures at base of telencephalon
- **Amygdala**: In charge of emotional memory and affective meaning
- Interaction with neocortex is foundation of emotional intelligence
- Two mnesiac systems: one for ordinary facts and one for emotion-laden facts

**Emotional Intelligence Abilities**:
- Motivation, self-regulation, empathy, hope

**Rational Neocortex Not Sufficient**:
- Permanent interaction with second brain (limbic system) necessary for harmonious functioning
- Second brain equipped with mirror system for empathy and feeling transmission/contagion

**Mimetic Desire and the Self**:
- **Girard, Lefort, and Beatrice**: No psychology except interindividual psychology
- Infant relates mimetically to others, including emotional and social aspects (first and second brains)
- Mimetic desire origin of self-formation
- Damasio's views on neural foundations of the self corroborate these ideas


### Chapter 7. The Three Possibilities of the Interdividual Rapport

**Interdividual Rapport: Three Possibilities**

**Three Possibilities:**
- Other as model: learning and friendship (peaceful imitation)
- Other as rival: mimetic desire leading to rivalry
- Other as obstacle: desire being blocked by the other

**Model as Model:**
- Deliberate transfer of knowledge or technique
- Mutual, continuous, peaceful imitation-suggestion
- Resonates in first brain as politically/morally justifiable, economically valid, religiously recommended
- Positive emotions: admiration and love for the teacher

**Model as Rival:**
- Appropriative mimesis leads to taking away the object pointed out by the rival
- Escalating process of mimetic rivalry
- Intellectual and moral justifications from first brain
- Negative emotions: resentment, anger, jealousy

**Model as Obstacle:**
- Desire to acquire model's belongings or being appears impossible
- Object of desire chooses the victor, becoming an insurmountable obstacle
- Third brain dresses itself in negative emotions and rationalizations.

**Individual Constitution:**
- Role of individual constitution in interdividuality: what determines psychological and psychopathological destiny?
- Human beings enter mimetic relationships with particular histories and structures
- Example of Krishnamurti's lecture: open model, enthusiastic followers.


#### Understanding Interdividual Rapport: Three Brain Theory and Psychological Functioning

**The Three Possibilities of the Interdividual Rapport (cont'd)**

**Effects of Krishnamurti's Lectures:**
- Category 1: First brain nourished by teaching, second has positive feelings, third is fixed in "model" position
- Category 2: Irritated and annoyed, believe Krishnamurti doesn't bring new ideas or solutions
- Category 3: Overwhelmed, consider his teachings wise but unable to understand or apply them

**Impact on Interdividual Rapport:**
- Category 1: Stuck in "obstacle" position with negative feelings of admiration and incapacity
- Category 2: Stuck in "rival" position with negative feelings of impatience, annoyance, and antipathy
- Category 3: Stuck in "model" position with sad feelings of discouragement and abandonment

**Implications:**
- These categories are not limited to Krishnamurti's lectures but occur in various human relationships
- Understanding the causes of these predispositions is important for changing them (discussed later)

**Questioning "Why":**
- Avoid binary oppositions and scapegoats that lead to impasses
- Focus on understanding how psychology works and can be modified

**Architecture of the Psychological Apparatus:**
- Three interconnected brains: cognitive (first), emotional (second), and social (third)

**Collective Intelligence:**
- Harmony and cooperation between individuals lead to increased power and new "selves"
- Dual or collective "selves" produce discoveries beyond individual capabilities

**Classical Nosology:**
- Psychoses: cognitive brain malfunctioning
- Neuroses: emotional brain malfunctioning (unconscious in psychiatrists)


#### European psychiatry: Overview of psychoses and neuroses with focus on cognitive and emotional disorders

**Classical European Nosology: Psychoses vs Neuroses**

**Psychoses**:
- Characterized by delusion, or discourse about reality that is delusional
- Three elements: mechanism(s), theme(s), and structure(s)
    1. **Paranoiac psychoses**: 
        - Single theme: demands, persecution, invention, or erotomania
        - Single mechanism: interpretation with secondary intuition
        - Perfectly systematized structure
    2. **Chronic hallucinatory psychoses (CHP)**:
        - Single theme: persecution or erotic-mystical
        - Single mechanism: hallucinations (auditory, olfactory, cenesthetic)
        - Relatively well-systematized structure
        - Mental automatism: feeling of thoughts being stolen
    3. **Schizophrenias**:
        - Multiple themes: persecution, mysticism, erotic or fantastic
        - Multiple mechanisms: hallucinatory, interpretative, imaginative, intuitive, mental automatism, disordered thought
        - Totally nonsystematized structure (incoherent discourse)
    4. **Paraphrenias**:
        - Single theme: fantastic or filiation
        - Single mechanism: imagination
        - Relatively well-systematized structure

**Neuroses**:
- Recognized by classical psychiatry as "mental illnesses" based on analysis of patient's delusion (discourse)

**Neuroses (cont.)**:
1. **Obsessional neurosis**:
   - Consciousness is clear, reasoning logical
   - Mysterious force compels patients to perform rituals
   - Failure to carry out ritual leads to anxiety
2. **Anxiety neurosis**:
   - Permanent anxiety with paroxysmal attacks without rational justification
   - Somatic manifestations: heart palpitations, sweating, breathing problems, stiffness
3. **Phobic neurosis**:
   - Fear focused and localized in an object/situation to reduce anxiety
4. **Hysterical neurosis**:
   - Characterized by somatic hyperexpressivity of ideas, images, and unconscious affects
   - Expressed through mimetic models (images, gestures) on the third brain


## Part 3. An Essay in Mimetic Nosology

Desire forms Bodies Without Organs (BwO), which can be destructured or cancerous; identify constructive desires on the plane of consistency despite these doubles using an abstract machine and assemblages.


### Chapter 9. Figures of the Other in Normal Experience

**Normal Experience: Figures of the Other**

**Imitation and Identification:**
- Imitation and identification can be normal mechanisms when model remains a model
- Imitator does not claim ownership or precedence over the model's desire
- Famous imitators do not require jealousy towards the model
- Impersonators add humor to caricature the model
- Professional imitators showcase our otherness and multiplicity

**Forgetting:**
- Forgetting preserves harmony in self and keeps it in existence
- Differs from suggestion: order vs. imitation
- Order is imposed without claiming ownership of desire
- Suggestion injects desire into the other, who forgets its source
- Forgetting is relaxing but opposed to recognizing own desire's otherness

**Collective Psychology:**
- In a crowd, mimetic attraction is hypertrophied
- Each person's self dissolves in collective desire (plural somnambulism)
- Described as "psychological crowd" or "delirious, delusional crowd"
- Amnesia is present but partial or total, depending on the sequence of events

**Implications:**
- Plural somnambulism: unconsciousness and dominance of other's desire
- Lack of amnesia when psychological crowd disperses
- Inaccurate testimonies from individuals caught up in crowd events.


#### Mimetic phenomena and the relationship between three brains: forgetting, identification, and hypnosis.

**The Relationship Between the Three Brains**
- The relationship between the three brains (cortical, limbic, and reptilian) is **close and constant**
- These relationships are **intimately imbricated and interconnected** by billions of neurons
- This new psychiatry must determine where the psychological disorder originated in order to choose the best therapeutic response

**Individual Psychology and Forgetting**
- **Forgetting** is an Edenic form of the interdividual rapport before the fall described in Genesis
- Forgetting presides over the constitution of the self at the moment of its creation
- When there is rivalry or opposition, a form of brutal awakening is manifested, leading to neurosis or psychosis
- Rivalry or obstacle must be explained and denied to try and return to the Edenic state
- **Identification** with the model is consolation for not possessing all their belongings

**Mimesis and Imitation**
- **Imitation** primarily involves the model's appearance (gestures, behaviors, reactions, way of speaking)
- **Mimesis** can involve the model's very being, which is called "identification"
- Apprenticeship in manual trades is an example of identifying with the master and seeking to surpass oneself

**Echolalia and Echopraxia**
- In certain neurological illnesses, the patient can only repeat what they hear (echolalia) and imitate gestures (echopraxia)
- This suggests that when the first brain is put out of commission, the third brain is liberated from its influence and can only respond with pure imitation
- In certain neurological illnesses, the second brain can produce "spasmodic" laughter or tears without any affective or cognitive significance


#### Understanding the dynamics of desire and rivals in human interactions: imitation and emulation.

**Rivalry and Unconscious**

**Hypnosis Session**:
- Françoise entered a hypnotic state and revealed she was "stuck" on a point in her thesis
- Rossi suggested her unconscious would help her find the solution
- Françoise suddenly snapped out of the trance in a state of anxiety

**Unconscious Conceptions**:
- Françoise's first brain saw Rossi's suggestion as the "Freudian unconscious" - a reservoir of repressed desires and sources of problems
- Rossi was speaking of the "Ericksonian unconscious" - a benevolent, protective guardian angel
- These two conceptions collided in Françoise, causing her first brain to react with anxiety

**Rivalry as Emulation**:
- **Constructive Rivalry**: A rivalry where the protagonists do not seek to destroy each other but to extend the limits of their mutual ambition
- Examples: Runner/Swimmer trying to beat their own records, boxers competing but admiring and befriending each other after
- In art, imitations in cascade represent an acceptance of the model's desire as inspiration for new production

**Mimetic Psychopathology**:
- The third brain can slip from seeing the model as a rival to claiming superiority over the model
- This can lead to neurosis or psychosis if the self is not persuaded it is the owner of its own desire
- Mimetic psychopathology is dynamic, evolutionary, and cinematographic in nature


#### Desire, Rivalry, and the Impact of Models on Human Relationships.

**Andre Agassi's Tennis Experience**
- Andre Agassi recounted lying exhausted after a grueling match, clasping his opponent's hand in recognition of their shared achievement

**Modeling Desire and Rivalry**
- The "first brain" has no need to provide rationalizations and simply gives its blessing to the whole undertaking while taking care of logistics (e.g., scheduling, preparation, organization)
- René Girard analyzed Freud and Lévi-Strauss with feelings of respect and gratitude, despite offering different perspectives on ethnological and psychological reality

**Standing on the Shoulders of Giants**
- Bernard de Chartres' metaphor: "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants"
- Desire recognizes the anteriority of the model's desire and claims to be closer to this desire than the model's epigones

**Imitation and Rivalry in Psychology**
- Psychoanalysts imitate Freud's conclusions but never fully adopt his desire for discovery
- Rivalry can be experienced as deferred violence or vengeance, even with admirable and respectable models

**The Dead Rival**
- In James Joyce's short story "Th e Dead," Gabriel is stunned when he learns that a potential rival named Michael Furey has died for Gretta, making him feel helpless and defeated
- The infi nite or absolute outcome of desire is tragic, as one realizes the model can never be reached, becoming an insurmountable obstacle

**Renunciation and Accepting Limits**
- The "normal" attitude is to renounce competition with the other and redirect one's desire in a more constructive direction, accepting one's own limits as well as those imposed by the social structure (e.g., the law)


### Chapter 10. Figures of the Other in Neurotic Experience

**Figures of the Other in Neurotic Experience: Mythomania and Pathomimia**

**Mythomania (Pseudologia Fantastica)**
- Individuals tell lies that they do not believe themselves
- Examples: presenting oneself as a successful businessman, telling stories unrelated to reality
- Form of self-aggrandizement and deception
- Narrative serves the needs of the third party, not for personal gain

**Pathomimia**
- Creating physical symptoms to lend credibility to a story
- Self-mutilation as a means of appearing sick or injured
- Attempts to attract attention and make oneself interesting
- Can be an expression of psychosis rather than self-mutilation in some cases
- Patients may use doctors or surgeons to give credence to their illness
- Example: Munchausen syndrome patients undergoing unnecessary surgeries
- Stigmata: imitation of wounds of Christ, claiming his desire through physical representation
- Rare phenomenon, portrayal is self-serving but theatrical in nature

**Neurotic Behavior and Figures of the Other**
- **Mythomania**: actor integrates desire of character to make himself look good, impressionistic
- **Pathomimia**: desire to be sick becomes frenetic and bloody, denial of authenticity while demanding healing from others
- Stigmata: violent appropriation of model's desire, conscious imitation but not mistaken for Christ

**The Cross as a Symbol and the Other as Rival**
- The cross represents various symbols in Christian faith
- Christ's suffering on the cross is admirable, yet fear arises from perceived rivalry with Other
- Anxiety neurosis: fear without object until identified as fear of rival
- Fear must be rationalized by first brain to justify explosions of anxiety.


#### Neurosis and representation of self and other in interdividual relationships.

**Neurotic Representation of Rival**

**First Stage:**
- Representing rival by an object, animal, or situation
- Avoiding anxiety through avoidance of triggering objects/situations
- Example: fear of mice, rats, sickness, public places

**Second Stage:**
- "Otherizing" a part of the body or physiological function
- Hiding rival behind conversion symptoms
- Representing rival during attacks of hysteria

**Intermediary Situation:**
- Duality in interdividual rapport: model as loved and respected vs. model as rejected, heavy, and restrictive
- Not entering neurosis yet, as no active misrecognition of the model-rival present

**Neurotic Neuralization:**
- Model becomes an active and demanding rival at points N and N'
- Representing model-rival in physical absence through "otherizing" a part of oneself
- Hysterical way to arrive at this result: representing other by a limb or physiological function

**Historical Context:**
- Ancient Greece: Hippocrates, Plato, Aretaeus of Cappadocia - "another organ" within men and women that behaves independently
- Saint Augustine: Intraphysical other becomes sacrilegious as it is not subject to self's control
- Seventeenth century: Mother Jeanne des Anges - Devil cannot influence self unless given consent, I am manipulated but by myself.


#### Exploring neurotic experiences: desire, intrapsychic others, and hysteria's manifestations.

**Interpretations of the Self and Intrapsychic Other**
* Mother Jeanne des Anges leads to Freud's idea of an intrapsychic other
* Enables claiming desire but avoiding responsibility
* Intrapsychic other beyond will's reach, inaccessible to consciousness
* Represents poisonous rivalry and source of suffering in hysteria

**Somatic Manifestations of Rivalry**
* Patients complain about pain in various body parts
* Examples: "pain in the neck/ass," getting on one's nerves, making one sick, etc.
* Psychotherapist can help patient recognize the connection to rivalry

**Case Examples**
1. *Voice/vote*: A candidate lost election due to lack of own voice/vote
   - Patient lost own voice after defeat
   - Connection between body and reality: rival took away voice/vote
2. *Dead Sea/Mother*: Man suffered from eczema after mother's death
   - Eczema seen as a form of resurrection, regeneration, or forgiveness

**Robert Musil's The Man without Qualities: Ulrich and Gerda**
* Gerda expresses reluctance and hysterical response during sexual encounter
* Fantastical rivalry sets in, destroying positive feelings
* Rival is present but not recognized as such by both parties
* Crisis destroys any potential rapport between them.


#### Neurosis and the Perceived Obstacle: Hysteria, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders, and Waterloo Syndrome.

**Musil's Lesson: Rivalry and Neurosis**

**Theatrical Scene of Rivalry Transformed into Medical Rationalization**
- Musil highlights the transformation of a theatrical scene of rivalry into a medical rationalization
- Ulrich's voice sounds more tender, meaning he sees her as a sick person
- Hysteria is the neurotic expression of rivalry
- The hysteric refuses and denies responsibility for their symptoms, blaming the rival

**Neurotic Response to Obstacles: Psychasthenia vs. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**
- Two ways to react when the third brain perceives the model as an obstacle:
  1. **Renunciation (psychasthenia)**: Characterized by fatigue, slowing of activity, and difficulty initiating actions
  2. **Compulsive repetition (OCD)**: Continually coming back to rub or knock at the obstacle
- Obsessive-compulsive disorders involve repeating rituals due to the presence of an obstacle
   - Rituals may include washing hands, counting, or hoarding insignificant objects
   - The third brain charges the first brain with rationalizing this perception of the other

**The Waterloo Syndrome**
- Patients obsessed with failure and replaying lost battles are said to have the "Waterloo Syndrome"
- This occurs when the patient's first brain reconstitutes a story to show that an event was definiitive, while the second brain dresses it up with feelings of regret and remorse
- Treating these disorders is difficult because the obstacle is often not identifiable or integrated far back in the patient's history

**Kafka's "The Trial"**
- In Kafka's novel, the Law represents the obstacle that the man desires to understand or surmount
- The doorkeeper forbids the man from approaching the Law, suggesting that only the man himself can gain admittance through this door
- This obstacle was intended for the man alone.


### Chapter 11. Figures of the Other in Psychotic Experience

**Paraphrenia: Figures of the Other in Psychotic Experience**

**The Other as a Model**
- Absolute model where imitator denies precedence of the other's desire
- Claims their own desire is the true one
- Example: Spanish engineer claiming to be Napoleon
  * Refused recognition of historical record
  * Insisted he was the real Napoleon and the "other" was a failed copy
  * Increased neuroleptic doses for patient with paraphrenic delusion

**Paraphrenia vs. Quixotic Delusion**
- Paraphrenia: Subject claims precedence of desire over the other's desire (encysted delusion)
  * Example: baker claiming to be Duc d'Orleans
    * Maintained daily life and kept delusion separate from reality
- Quixotic Delusion: Model is recognized, but subject adopts it completely
  * Example: Don Quixote
    * Recognized Amadis de Gaul as perfect knight
    * Attempted to resemble him in every way
    * Immersion into the model's world.

**Paraphrenia: Exceptional Desires**
- Subjects take on exceptional and dazzling desires for delusion
  * Napoleon, de Gaulle, Christ or Muhammad
- Banal desires not adopted as models
- Paraphrenic delusions produce extraordinary figures.


#### Understanding psychopathology through the lens of mimetic function and cultural context.

**Paraphrenia:**
- **Definition**: A form of delusional thinking where the person believes they are a famous historical figure or model, creating a "mimetic" experience
- **Characteristics**:
  - The historical person is recognized by others as famous, but the deluded individual denies their existence and sees themselves as the original
  - Temporal and existential inversion is the essence of paraphrenic delusion
- **Implications:**
  - Paraphrenia exists on a continuum with normal, neurotic, and psychotic phenomena due to the gradual exacerbation of the mimetic mechanism
  - Neurotic processes emphasize point N (first brain) while psychotic processes emphasize point N' (third brain)
- **Anthropological Perspective:**
  - Psychopathology exists against an anthropological and cultural backdrop
  - Understanding a patient's thought requires shared culture for nuances and dimensions of pathology
- **Historical Context:**
  - Asylums in the past were places where people could live with their delusions, even though they appeared "crazy" from the outside
  - Doctors lived with patients, benefiting from their talents when not experiencing delusions
  - Delusional patients would perform tasks with professional precision for doctors and staff
- **Reflections:**
  - Psychopathology exists against a cultural backdrop that shapes the justifications (first brain function) and emotive reactions (second brain) of delusions.
  - The universal similarity in pathologies is due to the third, mimetic brain function, while cultural backgrounds provide the "cloakroom" for various dimensions of pathology.


#### This passage discusses the role of the third brain in psychopathology and paranoia as a relational delusion.

**Understanding Psychopathology: The Role of Mimetic Brain and Interdividual Rapport**

**Introduction:**
- English gentleman's misunderstanding of Napoleon as a metaphor for self-perception
- Lack of rationality in psychopathology until the concept of mimetic brain

**Mimetic Brain:**
- Developing a hypothesis to explain behaviors and emotions related to models or rivals
- Three possibilities: model as rival, model as obstacle, or neutral relationship

**Model as Rival:**
- Suspicion and paranoia in first brain
- Perception of enemies everywhere or fixation on one suspected rival
- Manifestations of paranoia through delusions and hallucinations
  - Legal or aggressive responses to perceived persecution
  - Construction of stories explaining experiences

**Interpretative Paranoiac Delusions:**
- Deformation and distortion in relational dynamics with others
- Reactions fueled by third brain's relational and mimetic function
- Two opposite ways for first brain to rationalize delusions: delusion of persecution or delusions of grandeur.

**Parenthesis on Lacan:**
- Psychiatrists attribute the genesis of illness to personality disorder (paranoia)
- Agreement with Lacan that it is not a single personality but a succession of personalities
- Progressive personalities can evolve in opposite directions: increasingly sick or less adversarial.


#### Analyzing Rousseau's Paranoia: Desire, Mimetic Realities, and Interdividual Rapport

**Lacan's Perspective on Self and Personality**
- Lacan questions the concept of "continuity" of self
- Criticizes approach as too simplistic, viewing person as arbitrary link between states of consciousness
- Rejects idea of conventional self as merely "regular and comprehensible development"

**Mental Illness and the Brain Functions**
- Break in harmony of mimetic brain leads to mental illness
- Interdividual rapport becomes rivalrous, leading to delusional reasoning and passionate exaltation or depression
- Manic excitation (mood disorder) linked to paranoid persecutors
- Failure of claims or opposition to reality leads to depressive/melancholic states
- Dialectic of three brain functions: rivalry, rationalization, passion

**Lacan on Delusion and Reality**
- Symptoms manifest in social relations, not inanimate objects
- Interpretative delusion rooted in doorstep, street, forum (social life)

**Rousseau's Thoughts on Evil and Self-Regard**
- Origins of evil traced to private property and self-regard (amour-propre)
- Belief that there was a state of nature without desires or rivalries, destroyed by private property
- Difference responsible for wickedness and violence, but it is rivalry that produces difference

**Comparison and Frustration/Exaltation**
- Comparison can lead to frustration or exaltation depending on what one has compared to others.


#### Rousseau's romantic vision of man in nature, imitation, and humanization vs denaturing through domestication.

**Rousseau's View on Human Nature: Imitation, Comparison, Contagion**

**Introduction:**
- Rousseau's romantic vision of nature
- Misunderstanding of animal imitation

**Imitation and Comparison:**
- Man observes animals, measures himself against them
- Imitates skills but not strength
- Fear of natural infirmities and illnesses
- Comparison leads to understanding own weaknesses

**Contagion:**
- Transmission of knowledge, learning, language
- Neglected aspect in Rousseau's thoughts

**Domestication:**
- Humanization and denaturing of animals
- Animals imitate humans instead
- Emotional intelligence: passion and reason

**Mimeticism:**
- Denied by Rousseau but present in his work
- Desires copied from others, not corresponding to needs
- Paranoia and scapegoating in Rousseau's writings

**Reveries of a Solitary Walker:**
- Sense of isolation and persecution
- Unanimity among enemies: scapegoat mechanism
- Subjecitve unanimity in Rousseau's paranoia.


#### Psychosis and the Other: Scapegoats, Mimetic Rivalry, and Obstacles

**Rousseau's Exclusion from Society**
- Rousseau believed he was excluded from society, but it was actually himself who excluded himself
- He saw himself as a "monster, a poisoner, an assassin" and the "horror of the human race"
- Believed others would "spit upon him", bury him alive, and reject him

**Paranoia vs. Scapegoat**
- Rousseau's feelings align with those of the scapegoat in primitive religions
- In these religions, it is the myth that speaks for the scapegoat after its death
- Divinized scapegoat makes recommendations, prescriptions, injunctions, and prohibitions, bringing peace
- Rousseau gave nothing to his "persecutors" as he had excluded himself while still alive

**Misanthrope and Paranoia**
- Rousseau identified with the misanthrope in Molière's play
- Misanthrope wanted to be distinguished from others, asserting his superiority
- This desire for uniqueness is incompatible with being "the friend of mankind"
- Paranoia and misanthropy are one and the same

**Mimetic Rivalry and Obstacle**
- Misanthrope's need to be distinguished led him to see enemies everywhere
- Rousseau saw himself as superior to his persecutors, despite being rejected by society
- Paranoia is the psychotic expression of mimetic rivalry

**Obstacle-Desire and Model-Obstacle**
- When the model evolves into an obstacle, it forbids the possession of an object but also the very being and existence of the imitating self
- This leads to a "sign of the mirror" where schizophrenics no longer recognize themselves
- Dysmorphophobia is another symptom where a part of the body is otherized as the obstacle to desire's realization
- Voices heard by schizophrenics represent the model-obstacle, external to the self


#### Schizophrenia, psychosis, interdividual rapport, desiring the other, obstacles, imitation, paranoia, delusion, identity crisis, family dynamics.

**Schizophrenia: Two Major Varieties**
1. **Organic or Somatic Forms**: Includes hebephrenia and hebephreno-catatonia
2. **Psychogenic Schizophrenias**: Where the model taken as an obstacle in interdividual rapport plays a major role

**Case Study: Younger Brother's Delusion**
- Younger brother felt his father was not a worthy model for identification
- Admired and offered to work for his uncle instead
- Uncle rejected the request, leading to fragmented personality and delusional thoughts
- Desire to be with his ideal model (uncle) led to persecutory delusions and withdrawal from social life.

**Clinical Tableau**: If the uncle had given in to young man's request:
- Young man would have been happy but still seen his uncle as a rival
- He might have started giving orders at the office, causing potential rivalrous psychosis due to the absurdity of undertaking.

**Paranoia and Paranoid Psychosis**:
- Clinical tableau touches on the sometimes oscillating kinship between paranoia and paranoid psychosis
- In the young man's case, the model (uncle) is initially loved but becomes an obstacle as he refuses identification.


#### Nietzsche's schizophrenic conflict with Wagner: love, hatred, and ambivalence.

**Nietzsche's Letters and Schizophrenia:**

**Background:**
- Nietzsche's admiration for Wagner
- Early letters: recognition, veneration
- Mid-November 1872: no students, inferiority acknowledged
- April 1873: imitation and learning from Wagner

**Conflict and Ambivalence:**
- January 1878: criticism of Parsifal
- Separation of wisdom from wise men
- Growing dissociation
- Increasing rivalry with Wagner (September 1878)
- Discovery of similarity in desires (July 1882)
- Narcissistic wound and ambivalence (December 1887)

**Schizophrenia Symptoms:**
- Divided self: self-of-two-contradictory-desires
- Love and hatred for the model (Wagner)
- Delusion of superiority
- Dissociation
- Ambivalence.


#### Nietzsche's relationship with Wagner and the onset of delusion. Competition, fame, and identification.

**Nietzsche's Relationship with Wagner**
- **Genius compensating for mental illness**: Nietzsche sees similarities between himself and Wagner, perceiving them as having a "sort of genius" that produces the same therapeutic effect
- **Rivalry and inferiority**: Nietzsche feels inferior to Wagner, believing his compositions are superior. He sees Wagner's fame as overblown and attempts to bring him down
- **Isolation and delusion**: As Nietzsche becomes more isolated, he begins to delusively believe he is the only one with true genius, replacing God and Wagner. He signs letters with names like "the Crucified One" or "Dionysus" as an attempt to escape his feelings of victimization
- **Euphoria and dementia**: Nietzsche oscillates between euphoria at his perceived greatness and feeling completely insignificant, ultimately becoming "quite simply demened"

**Mimetic Psychopathology Perspective**
- Nietzsche's schizophrenic behavior is rooted in his inability to handle the obstacle of Wagner as a rival. His delusion allowed him to surpass this obstacle and become "all historical personages"
- The differential diagnosis between paranoia and schizophrenia depends on this model, with Nietzsche's behavior ultimately leading to dementia (feeling nothing at all)
- Mimetic psychology offers a more coherent explanation of human behavior compared to the incoherent DSM-IV classification system.


### Chapter 12. Mood Disorders

**Mood Disorders: Endogenous vs Exogenous**

**Endogenous Mood Disorders:**
- Originate in the second brain (paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus)
- Characterized by periodic recurrence of manic and depressive episodes
  - Alternation between mania and depression: bipolar disorder
  - Only manic or depressive episodes: monopolar disorder
  - Strong genetic component, resulting from biological constitution
  - Manic states: accelerated psychic processes, increased productivity, self-assurance, megalomania
  - Depressive states: slowdown of psychic processes, pessimism, black thoughts, misanthropy, guilt feelings
- Contribution of the three brains: second brain's biology affects first and third brains (interdividual rapport)

**Exogenous Mood Disorders:**
- Originate in response to interdividual problems, not genetic predisposition
- Reactive depression or euphoria caused by external events: failure, success, love affair, happy experiences
  - Difficult to distinguish clinically from endogenous depression/euphoria based on anamnesis (presence of previous similar episodes and noticeable cause)

**Mademoiselle L.'s Case:**
- Strange alcoholism: drinking rum before speaking in public or during work meetings
- Previous psychoanalytic treatment for twelve years without significant results
- Mood swings: highs (manic states) and lows (depressive states)
  - Repressed violence manifested through aggressive behavior towards men
  - History of father's rape leading to parents' divorce and caring for her father.

**Discussion:**
- Endogenous mood disorders have a genetic component, while exogenous mood disorders result from external events that affect interdividual rapport.
- Both types of disorders can significantly impact an individual's life, causing various symptoms that may require professional help to manage.


#### Understanding Mood Disorders: Endogenous vs. Reactive and the Role of Desire and Interdividual Relationships in Psychiatry

**Mood Disorders: Endogenous vs. Exogenous**

**Patient's Case:**
- Woman experienced oscillating attitudes towards her father post-rape: hatred/desire for vengeance (manic state) and guilt (depression)
- Alcohol use to drown suffering
- Psychotherapy ongoing, progress but not healed

**Diagnosis:**
- Differential diagnosis between endogenous and exogenous mood disorders requires careful consideration by psychotherapist
- Question: "Is your essential goal the one that is motivating your desire to commit suicide?"
  - Helps distinguish between endogenous (biological/genetic) and reactive depressions

**Endogenous vs. Exogenous Mood Disorders:**
- **Endogenous**: Originate from within the individual, may be linked to chemical, pharmacological, or toxic factors
  - Examples: Genetic predisposition, metabolic imbalances, certain medications, alcohol
- **Exogenous**: Caused by external events, such as loss of loved ones or traumatizing experiences

**Mood Disorders and the Brain:**
- Mood disorders rooted in specific nucleus of hypothalamus
- Chemical mechanisms known, neurotransmitters identified
- New psychiatry aims to address problem at root through pharmacological means

**Interdividual Rapport and Mood Disorders:**
- Endogenous disorders: Tsunami starts in second brain, triggers rationalization and modification of vision of other on third brain level
  - Leads to anesthetization of feelings towards the other and disappearance of desire
- External factors may also contribute to mood disorders by creating intellectual claims or rivalries (first brain) leading to emotional storms in body (hysteria).

**Determining the Origin:**
- Difficult to determine where and how pathological process started, especially in cases of hysteria
  - Emotional/affective storm may be consequence or origin of rivalry mechanisms.


### Chapter 13. Diseases of Desire

**Behavioral Disorders: Diseases of Desire**
- Characterized by desire's independence and preeminence over need and instinct
- Desire takes control, subverting, perverting, or canceling out need/instinct
- Stems from the third brain's influence on the other two brains
- Manifested through interpersonal relationships (mimetic brain)

**Sadomasochism**
- Two-player game: masochist plays persecuted role, sadist is persecutor
- Masochist seeks closeness to "surplus of being" or divinity by submitting
- Sadist finds pleasure in affirming superiority through inflicting suffering
- Can manifest outside sexual arena (e.g., advertising)
- Structured power dynamics: submission/dominance, obsession with forbidden desires
- René Girard's perspective: desire changes models into obstacles that fuel desire for superiority.

**Personal Tendencies and Mirror Neurons**
- Interpersonal rapport structure reflects individual tendencies
- Mirror neurons strongly reflect sexual desire in response to objects or partners
- Some individuals take pleasure from sadomasochistic relationships and media.

**Clinical Example: Sadomasochism**
- Couple engaged in leather/BDSM activities, with wife submitting to husband's whipping
- Husband's mimetic state escalated, requiring involvement of another man to trigger desire.


#### Mimetic desire and its destructive forms: Don Juanism and Messalinism.

**Understanding Mimetic Desire: Don Juanism and Messalinism**

**Mimetic Desire**:
- A person's desire for an object is influenced by the desires of a model or rival
- Can result in behaviors like depriving the model of the desired object, or exhausting the object so it cannot be enjoyed by rivals

**Don Juanism and Messalinism**:
- Characterized by the desire to deprive a model or rival of the pleasure of an object
- Don Juan: Jealousy and seduction of another's love interest
- Messalinism: Manipulating a lover until they are "exhausted" and unable to be enjoyed by others
- Risk: Fixation on a forbidden, inaccessible object due to a model's influence

**Clinical Experience**:
- Individuals with mimetic desires can have varying attitudes towards objects
- A small detail can shift the individual's desire between "normal," "neurotic," "psychotic," or "perverse" behavior
- The second brain may provide an emotional cloaking for the destructive actions of the first brain


#### Desire, Seduction, Rivalry, Impotence, Freudian Psychology, Manipulation, Intimacy, Aggression, Love, and Sexuality.

**Seduction and Manipulation**
- **Don Juan**: Abandons his "unfortunate mistress" justifying himself with an "It's not my fault" that shatters the woman's reason
- **Madame de Tourvel**: Goes mad before she dies
- **Messalina**:
  - In the "period of seduction or start-up phase", willing to make any sacrifice
  - Broke her ankle but insisted on making love with a man to "hook" him
  - Felt terrible agony but put on a brave front to "capture" the person
- **Rival-Desire**:
  - Can turn against the real or imagined, current or future, actual or fictional, model
  - Quivers like a fish that can annoy Messalina and cause her to brutalize them
- **Perverse Narcissists**:
  - Manipulate by first seducing and establishing an "intimate" relationship based on trust
  - Victims are attracted to the "experiencing moments of intensity" which awakens them from daily monotony, even at the cost of physical and mental health
- **Impotence, Premature Ejaculation, and Frigidity**:
  - Conditions by relations of aggression and rivalry
  - Freud describes psychical impotence as the "non-convergence of the affectionate and sensual currents in erotic life"
  - Rivalrous combustion is necessary to nourish sensuality and passion, whether it's with a third party or within the couple
  - The struggle for superiority, or power, is resolved through coitus, whose aggressive tenor evacuates the aggressivity and sedates the rivalry
- **Freud's Conclusion**: "Where they love they do not desire, and where they desire they cannot love"


#### Sexual dysfunctions: frigidity, impotence, and the interdividual cold war.

**Sexual Dysfunction: Frigidity and Impotence**

**Impact of Love on Senses and Sexual Functioning:**
- Crébillon's novel discusses the connection between love, male impotence, and Freudian theory (affectate current)
- Metaphor: escalation to extremes in coitus or total/partial inhibition
  - Premaature ejaculation: surrendering to "enemy" from the start
  - Total inhibition: absolute respect for woman, sexual act seen as violation

**Female Frigidity:**
- Stekel's perspective on frigidity as a struggle between sexes
- Cold war analogy: some women are in a total or partial cold war against men and sexuality
  - Frigidity is a solution for some, while others experience it as a problem
- Apparent anesthesia vs. reality: men's lack of experience and skill play a role

**Case Study:**
1. Woman suffering from unbearable pain, burning sensations, and itching in vulvo-perineal region
2. Urologist couldn't find organic explanation for symptoms
3. Patient withdrawn, unhappy, and unwilling to discuss issues
4. Interrupted cold war: occasional "hotter" conflicts between partners
5. Attempts to explain psychogenesis of her problems met with resistance
6. War metaphor used to help patient laugh and open up about sexual problems
7. Tranquilizers prescribed to calm emotional reaction, symptoms abate in a few days
8. Patient divorces husband three months later and meets new partner who changed everything for the better

**Nymphomania:**
- Stekel's reference to Messa-lina (Claudius's third wife) as "Invicta" (unvanquished), highlighting the idea that no man or quantity of men could satisfy her.


#### Discusses various disorders stemming from obsessive desires and rivalry: anorexia, bulimia, and drug addictions.

**Diseases of Desire:** Anorexia and Bulimia

**Anorexia**:
- Desire to imitate models of feminine beauty
- Overrides need, instinct, and physiological balance
- Result in anorexia, emaciation, and amenorrhea
- Mimetic: seeks to outdo feminine rivals in skinniness
- Skinniness becomes an end in itself, detached from benefits
- Affects young women and increasing number of men

**Bulimia**:
- Two types: those who want to become thin but indulge in binge eating
  - Weak rival-desire, compromise
  - Feel guilty, unhappy, depressed
- Obese bulimics: eat to fill a void and appease anguish
  - Desire exaggerates need, erases satiety
  - Permanent hunger is an ersatz of desire
  - Accumulation of extra pounds recalls obsessive hoarding
  - Third brain chained to desire that is never satisfied

**Drugs Addictions**:
- Lack of taboo in current culture leaves young people deprived of desire
- Drugs provide an ersatz of lack and deprivation.


#### The text discusses drug addictions as substitutes for rites of passage and the genesis of desire in modern society.

**Drug Addictions as Substitutes for Initiation Rites**

**Background:**
- Young people seeking experiences to engender self in absence of taboos and authority
- Absence of authority leads to weakness, inconsistency, and anxiety (Sutter)
- Nosological categories vague; drug addicts likened to participants in ancient initiation rites

**Impact of Sexual Revolution:**
- Disappearance of sexual initiation rites in Western culture
- Young people face anxiety alone without rites of passage for desire

**Drugs as Substitutes:**
- Drug addictions provide experience of desire and ecstasy/annihilation
- Agensesis (absence of development) of desire entails non-formation of solid self
- Desire transformed into willpower through obstacles and difficulties

**New Phenomena: Diseases of Desire**
- Illnesses linked to modern Western society
- Examples: Anorexia, bulimia (do not exist in developing countries)


## Part 4. The Dialectic of the Rational Emotional and Mimetic Brains

Desire forms Bodies without Organs (BwO) on the plane of consistency; distinguish desirable BwOs from cancerous or empty ones; abstract machine connects and ties in desires on the plane to create a total identity of effects.


### Chapter 14. The Mimetic Mechanism

**The Mimetic Mechanism: Understanding the Three Brains**

**Clinical and Phenomenological Observation**:
- Goal is to understand "how" things happen, not "why"
- Renouncing the "why" question as an immature inquiry
- Focusing on observing phenomena, disorders, and the evolution of the mimetic mechanism

**Psychotherapy Integration**:
- Develop a new form of psychotherapy that integrates all discussed notions
- Use medications targeting the three brains: neuroleptics (first brain), tranquilizers, antidepressants, normothymic drugs (second brain)
- Research for medications targeting the third brain

**The Three Brains in Action**:
- **Example 1**: Man A hesitates to order at a bar, then Man B orders loudly. Mirror neurons trigger Man A to also order.
- **Example 2**: Political powers manipulate the "path of least resistance" by appealing to the third brain's mimetic desires
- **Example 3**: In a crowd situation, the third brain is enchanted by facility and draws the first brain into collective euphoria
- **Example 4**: In one-on-one situations, the third brain produces empathy, understanding, and friendship by taking another as a model

**Rivalry and Conflict**:
- The third brain identifies an intruder as a rival, causing anger and conflict
- Rivalry can escalate to extremes, absorbing the individuals and blinding them to the object of their rivalry
- Examples: Media firestorm over Valérie Trierweiler's tweet, political endorsements leading to conflict between partners.


### Chapter 15. Some Clinical Studies

**Chapter Fifteen: Clinical Studies**

**Violette's Case**:
- Young woman of 27 from a good background, intelligent, direct and open
- Handed psychiatrist a letter from the doctor informing about her suicide attempt due to parents' divorce proceedings
- Parents are involved in rivalry and have lost sight of Violette's feelings, interests, and affectivity
- Violette is "the ball" in their rivalry, and is tired of being shaken and buffeted by each parent's movements
- Psychiatrist explains the analogy of a soccer match where parents are focused on their rivalry, and Violette is the "ball"
- Prescribes light sedative to reduce intensity of emotions, and advises Violette to work together to change the situation
- Helps Violette understand her role as an observer instead of a participant in her parents' conflict
- Positive outcome: Violette discovers watching tennis matches with a friend is more enjoyable than being the "ball"

**André's Case**:
- Successful CEO, in "shitty situation" due to liaison with former secretary that was discovered by wife
- Wife harasses him constantly for answers and information about Mathilde
- Struggling to eat, sleep, work, or make decisions due to anxiety and weeping episodes
- Third brain oscillating between the "model" (wife) and "rival" (Mathilde), causing both to panic and confusion
- Psychiatrist aims to calm down André's nervous system to help him reflect, react, and make decisions.


#### Marital infidelity, therapy sessions, hysterical oscillation between rivalry and love.

**Patient Treatment: Case Study**

**Prescription**:
- Light treatment of tranquilizers and antidepressants to reduce anxiety, urge to weep, and improve sleep
- Explain therapy to Mathilde and ask her not to contact patient for a while
- Ask wife to reflect on the situation and not discuss it with the patient until he feels better

**Patient's Progress**:
- Feeling less anxious and eating/sleeping better
- Mathilde reacted well, expressed understanding and concern
- Wife accepts idea, no longer explosive but wants to consult therapist

**Analysis of Patient's Condition**:
- **First brain**: Anxious, confused, and disturbed by affair
- **Second brain**: Calm, reflective, capable of functioning but still oscillating between emotions
- **Third brain**: Inconsistent, shifting between rivalry and love towards wife

**Therapist's Advice to Wife**:
- Understand that the patient is not a rival, but an ally in keeping their family together
- Overcome pride and work on forgiveness and understanding towards her husband

**Wife's Response**:
- Confused about why therapist is not taking her side
- Wants to consult female therapist for advice

**Therapist's Explanation**:
- Not taking sides, only promoting reason and understanding between couple
- Warned wife that continued antagonism may lead to loss of husband.


#### Overcoming rivalry and restoring family relationships through recognition and understanding

**Ahmed's Case:**

**Background:**
- Ahmed, a man of about fifty, sought help after attempting suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills.
- He was accompanied by his wife but asked her to stay in the waiting room.
- Ahmed explained that he was "dying of shame" and wanted to sleep and forget.

**Family Dynamics:**
- Ahmed adored his father who built an industrial empire, but Omar (his older brother) took over everything after their father's death.
- Omar falsified papers and will, becoming more arrogant and excluding Ahmed from the business.
- Ahmed promised to send his eldest son to college in the U.S., but Omar refused to pay for it.
- This led Ahmed to become angry, humiliated, and powerless, causing him to lose self-esteem.

**Emotional State:**
- Ahmed's third brain was producing rage and anger.
- His second brain was generating resentment, shame, and loss of self-esteem.
- The emotional brain was experiencing hyperexcitation, which bumped up against cultural, social, familial, and religious conventions.

**Diagnosis:**
- Thwarted mania: not depression, as antidepressants would add fuel to the fire.
- Paranoia: interpreting his failure and brother's success as a conspiracy.

**Lacan's Perspective:**
- Momentary disorders of perception in psychosis are qualifi ed as interpretative due to their analogy with normal interpretation.
- The dynamic notion of social tensions, whose equilibrium or rupture normally defines personality in the individual, is acknowledged as explanatory of psychotic facts.

**Ahmed's Current State:**
- Emotional: experiencing anger and shame.
- Physical: insomnia.
- Thought process: accelerated, changing rapidly, stuck in one place or unfolding slowly.


#### Complex case study: Love, Rivalry, and Psychosis

**Ahmed's Case:**
- **Symptoms**: weeps easily, chills, hot flashes, heart palpitations, pins and needles in hands and feet, lump in throat preventing speech
- **Diagnoses**: paranoiac psychosis (first brain), somatic expression of hysterical type with conversion reaction (second brain), mood disorder of manic type (second brain)
- **Addictions**: benzodiazepines, sleeping pills due to tenacious insomnia
- **Underlying Issue**: extreme adversarial tension in interdividual rapport with brother

**Albert's Case:**
- **Background**: ex-girlfriend advised him to see therapist
- **Issue**: loss of exclusive relationship with Élodie due to her having multiple lovers while still being faithful in a sense
- **Impact**: confusion, loss of meaning, anxiety, jealousy, depressive and suicidal thoughts, euphoria
- **Consequences**: acute psychosis for young people (impossible to attain love object), collapse of second brain with severe depression and risk of suicide for older individuals.

**Commonalities:**
- Both cases involve complex emotional issues and multiple diagnoses (Ahmed: paranoia, conversion reaction, mood disorder; Albert: acute psychosis)
- Importance of addressing underlying tensions in relationships to prevent more severe consequences.


## Conclusion

**Conclusion**

**Childhood Experience**:
- Struggled to see the blackboard in class

- Recognized the importance of recognizing and facing the reality of human behavior

**Human Condition and Mimetic Desire**:
- Human beings look at the world subjectively, shaped by mimetic desire
- Illusion can distort perception of reality
- Effort required to see things as they are

**Psychotherapy and Initiation**:
- Psychotherapy must account for the reality of human behavior
- Recognizing mimetic mechanisms is a transformative, initiatory process
- Attaining wisdom is the ultimate goal

**Role of Great Sages**:
- Teachings of great sages aim to develop wisdom
- Lack of awareness of third brain and its interaction with other brains can hinder progress

**Therapeutic Approach**:
- Therapist must address each patient's unique path, using various initiatory processes and medications as needed
- Medications primarily target the first, second, or third brain for specific issues
- Further research needed to develop pharmacological approaches that influence mirror neurons and empathy.


### Exploring wisdom through desire, forgetting, and mimetic relationships in psychology and psychiatry.

**The Role of Psychotherapy and Mimetics**

**Challenges for Young Psychiatrists:**
- Difficulty in keeping up with varying semiology and nosology across schools (DSM-IV/V, CIM-10)
- Skepticism towards psychotherapy and medication
- Increasing fear of treatments among patients
- Denial of mental illness

**Importance of a Broader Knowledge Base:**
- Young psychiatrists must increase their knowledge in various fields: philosophy, psychology, anthropology, ethnology
- Develop self-awareness to help patients
- Preference for what one has over what one doesn't have
- Renunciation of comparisons and rivalry

**Mimetics in Psychotherapy:**
- Psychotherapist as a model for patients
- Gradual shift towards mimetic psychotherapy techniques
- Establishing interdividual rapport without rivalry or obstacles

**Voltaire's Philosophy on Desire, Work and Happiness:**
- Cultivating one's garden (work on oneself) is the remedy for sadness, envy, jealousy
- Avoid comparison between gardens to maintain happiness
- Working in your garden = essence of life

**Rousseau vs. Voltaire on Property and Rivalry:**
- Rousseau: private property causes rivalry and social disorder
- Voltaire: cultivating one's garden (work) prevents comparisons, leading to happiness

**Conclusion:**
- Retired people may experience depression due to lack of purpose after achieving desired freedom from work
- Maintaining a focus on personal growth can help prevent feelings of nothingness.


### Work, cultivating one's garden, self-reflection, overcoming mimetic desire, psychotherapy, cognitive and non-cognitive approaches, first and third brains, social connections, laughter, hypnosis.

**The Importance of Cultivating One's Own Garden**

**Mimetic Desire and Human Condition**:
- Mimetic desire leads to "convulsions of apprehension" and "lethargy of boredom"
- Work is a remedy to these discontents and mimetic rivalry

**Work as a Form of Self-Improvement**:
- Working on oneself, like all work, begins with waking up
- Recognizing one's models and rivals is therapeutic
- This recognition can lead to rejection of the model's influence

**The Role of Brains in Understanding**:
- Up until now, we have used only our first (cognitive) brain to understand each other
- Techniques like psychotherapy and hypnosis address different brains:
  - Cognitive therapies address the first brain
  - Primal scream therapy mobilizes the second brain
  - Classical hypnosis directly addresses the third brain

**The Power of Shared Laughter**:
- Shared laughter strengthens bonds of friendship
- Classical hypnosis is a form of psychotherapy that solely addresses the third brain


### Initiatory hypnosis: letting go and experiencing self-transformation through desire and dependency.

**Hypnosis as Initiation: A Psychotherapeutic Perspective**

**Understanding Hypnosis:**
- Substitution of patient's desire d and self dissolution (lethargy)
- Replacement by hypnotist's desire D, producing new self s' (somnambulistic state)
- Initiatory experience: ritual agony, death, resurrection
- Two mechanisms at work: dependency on therapist and model as absolute model

**Janet's Warning:**
- Be wary of "somnambulistic passion" or patient attachment to hypnotist
- Dependency leads to autocratic/theocratic abuses
- Millions aspire to mechanization, avoiding hard work of thinking

**Hypnosis as Initiation:**
- Gradual psychotherapy preparation necessary
- Letting go: concentrating on the present moment
- Experiencing letting go with model's guidance
- Potential for initiatory experiences throughout life
- Exorcising fear of death, enabling clear vision of reality.
