# Philosophys Violent Sacred Heidegger And Nietzsche Through Duane Armitage (2021)

> Continental and postmodern thinking has misidentified the source of violence as originating from Western metaphysics. It has further failed to acknowledge the Judeo- Christian source of its ethic—the ethic of concern for victims. In this volume Duane Armitage attempts a critique of continental philosophy and postmodernism through the lens of René Girard’s mimetic theory. This critique is directed primarily at the philosophies of Nietzsche and Heidegger, both among the foremost representatives of continental and postmodern thought. Armitage argues that Girard’s engagement with Heidegger and Nietzsche radically alters many of the axioms of current postmodern continental philosophy, in particular the overcoming of metaphysics on the theoretical level and continental philosophy’s tacit commitments to (neo-)Marxism on the practical level. Detailed attention to the implications of Girard’s philosophical thought results in a paradigm shift that deals perhaps a deadly blow to continental and postmodern thinking. Armitage further argues that Girard’s thinking solves the very problems that continental and postmodern thinking sought (but failed) to solve, namely the problems of violence and victimization, particularly within the context of the aftermath of the Second World War. Ultimately, this volume shows that at the heart of postmodern thinking lies an entanglement with the violent sacred. - [Philosophys Violent Sacred_Heidegger and Nietzsche through_Duane Armitage_2021](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophys-Violent-Sacred-Heidegger-Nietzsche/dp/1611863872?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

### Introduction

**Introduction:**
- Critique of postmodernism and Continental philosophy through René Girard's lens
- Engagement with Nietzsche and Heidegger
- Arguments that Girard's thinking alters many axioms in current postmodern, Continental philosophy
- Focus on the problem of violence and victimization within Continental and postmodern thinking

**Continental Philosophy:**
- Represented by representatives such as Nietzsche and Heidegger
- Primarily influenced by Platonism, or split-world metaphysics
- Overcoming reason ( Logos, ratio ) as the ground of reality
- Originated in Europe, particularly Germany and France
- Influenced by Husserl's phenomenology method but sought to undercut ratio to reveal being

**Heidegger:**
- Seeking to overcome metaphysics/Platonism
- Critique of onto-theo-logy (metaphysics leading to failed theism)
- Dominant figure in Continental philosophy with axiomatic influence on the field.

**Key Arguments:**
- Postmodern thinking has misidentified the source of violence as Western metaphysical tradition and reason itself
- Failure to recognize Judeo-Christian source of ethic, instead embracing violence in attempts to overcome it
- Continental philosophy's critique of metaphysics/Platonism leads to various forms of violence.


#### Critique of reason and Western philosophy: Postmodernism and Continental thought on power and truth.

**Continental Philosophy:**
* Critique of science and scientific reductionism
* Origins in Husserl, Heidegger, Nietzsche, Kant, and Kierkegaard
* Rejection of the idea that science can account for all human experience
* Arguments that science ultimately reveals nothing about truth but rather technology, control, and power
* Connection to postmodernism through critique of reason and rationality

**Postmodernism:**
* French reception in late 20th century of German philosophy (Nietzsche, Heidegger)
* Defined by Jean-François Lyotard as a mistrust of "metanarratives"
* Core critique is of reason, rationality, intelligibility, and truth
* Originated from Heidegger's and Nietzsche's criticisms of reason
* Rejection of the limits set by Kant's critical philosophy
* Attempt to get beyond reason to a nonrational foundation
* Critique of Western metaphysics as reducing meaning to control and manipulation
* Power functions as the primary nonrational condition for reason
* Tension between critique of truth and postmodern ethics/political ideologies.

**Girard's Contribution:**
* Reframes the fundamental issue in Continental and postmodern philosophy: hegemony of reason
* Critique of Nietzsche and Heidegger's thinking on power, reality, and being
* Deconstructs and reconfigures paradigm set by them
* Shows origin of violence within mythic sacred rather than hegemony of reason or Western metaphysics.

** Christianity:**
* Plays an important role in the thinking of Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Girard
* Figures prominently in Girard's mimetic theory
* Memorably said by Nietzsche that Christianity is "Platonism for the people" due to its packaging of split-world metaphysics and the necessary prominence given to Logos (ratio) as second person of Trinity.
* Heidegger thought that Christianity's conceptual framework is merely the outer shell of a deeper Platonism, heralding the metaphysics of modern science and technology.


#### Critiquing Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Postmodernism through Mimetic Theory's Christian Perspective

**Continental Philosophy: Christianity, Platonism, and Violence**

**Overview**:
- Both Nietzsche and Heidegger saw Christianity and Platonic metaphysics as inextricably bound
- Saw this union as foundational to Western culture
- Aimed criticisms at Platonism as Christianity's metaphysical foundation
- Offered critiques of Christianity (as a religion and morality) apart from its metaphysical foundations

**Nietzsche and Heidegger's Critiques of Christianity**:
- Incorrect, for several reasons:
  - Fail to see the unique religious contribution of Christianity
  - Mischaracterize Christianity as a weak or slavish moral perspective laced with resentment
  - Downplay or ignore Christianity's cultural, religious, and moral significance

**Girard's Mimetic Theory**:
- Identifies fundamental errors in Continental philosophy regarding violence and power
- Argues that the failure to recognize Christianity's central role in forming Western culture has led to postmodernism and Marxism
- Sees both Nietzsche and Heidegger's critiques of Christianity as misguided, especially regarding their views on truth, reason, and "being"

**Alternative: Christian Platonism/Metaphysics**:
- The only viable option for understanding and curtailing violence and power, according to the author
- Compatible with mimetic theory's ontology and axioms

**Key Terms**:
- **Platonism**: Basic sense refers to a split-world metaphysics where there exists a true, supersensible world beyond the apparent sensible one
  - Includes Thomism and Augustinianism as examples of this "Platonism"
  - Orthodox Christianity is difficult to reconcile with anything other than this basic sense of Platonism


### Chapter 1. The Sacred as Violence

**Girard's Thesis on Violence and Religion**

**Introduction:**
- Introduction to Girard's theses on violence and religion as a summary for philosophical implications, applications, and problems.
- Contention that Girard deals a fatal blow to postmodernism's critique of rationality, truth, and metanarratives by focusing on mimetic desire as the essence of human nature, violence as the heart of the mythic sacred, and Judeo-Christianity's deconstruction of the violent sacred.

**Girard's Theses:**
1. **Mimetic Desire**:
   - Desires are imitated from others (models) through mimesis.
   - Humans have a greater capacity for mimesis than animals.
   - Mimetic desires lead to conflict and violence due to scarcity and rivalry.
2. **Violence and the Sacred**:
   - Violence is essential to religion and the sacred, particularly sacrifice.
   - Sacrifice involves the shedding of blood from a victim, which is crucial for making sacred and sacrificial acts.
3. **Judeo-Christianity's Deconstruction of Mythic Violent Sacred**:
   - Human communities cope with inevitable violence through religion as a cathartic mechanism.
   - Religion allows collective persecution and victimization, uniting the community in harmony after peace is restored through banishing or deifying the guilty victim.

**Implications:**
- Discussion of philosophical implications, applications, and problems arising from Girard's thinking will be explored further in subsequent chapters.
- Connection to Nietzsche and Heidegger's thinking will also be addressed.


#### Understanding violence and sacrifice in religious contexts: Girard's theory on scapegoats and desacralization.

**Violence and the Sacred: Girard's Perspective**

**The Sacred and Violence (1-3)**
- For Girard, violence is the "sacred" due to fear and awe it inspires
- Ritual sacrifice keeps human violence in check
- The logic of sacrifice concealed from those who offer it
- Mythological foundations reveal moral complexity in gods
- Gods are not morally perfect; may instigate havoc
- Original rituals contained reenactments of founding death
- Animal sacrifice later substituted with less cathartic effect

**Myth and the Victim's Perspective (4-7)**
- Myth is recounting of victimization from mob's perspective
- Inverted myth: telling story from victims' point of view
- Judeo-Christian tradition exemplifies this inversion
- Biblical texts reveal concealed innocence of victims
- Scapegoat mechanism exposed as victims were never guilty

**The Power of Mimetically Contagious Mob (8)**
- Mob mentality compels unanimous communities to see victims as guilty, later divine
- Bible dissolves confusion between victimization process and the divine
- Universal ethic of compassion and mercy emerges in Judaism and Christianity

**Desacralization: The Deconstruction of Violence (9-13)**
- Desacralization: slow revelation of mythic scapegoat mechanism in favor of nonviolence
- Judaism begins the deconstruction process
- Climax of desacralization comes with Jesus' Passion and innocent victim mechanism being fully unveiled
- Christianity is the end of myth itself as it reveals humans as causers of violence.


#### Exploring Girard's theory on Christ's non-violent nature and the role of imitation in overcoming mimetic rivalry.

**Girard's View on God and Violence**

**Non-violent Nature of God**
- God not confused with violence
- Christ dies forgiving his own victimizers (John 20:19)
- God takes upon himself humanity's violence in its entirety
- No limit to God's goodness and forgiveness

**Human Violence and Scapegoating**
- Human beings commit Deicide due to mimetic rivalry
- Christ's death reveals the nature of human beings and God
- Victims are innocent, persecutors are ignorant
- Satan as violence itself, accuser of innocent victims

**Imitatio Christi and Mimetic Ethics**
- Christ is perfect model to imitate (John 5:19)
- Imitating Father's non-rivalrous love (Luke 6:35)
- Absorbing evil instead of reciprocating ends mimetic rivalry

**Philosophical Implications**
- Christ forgives enemies and absorbs evil: imitate him
- Meeting excessive demands twice over to stop rivalry
- Imitating Passion requires forgiveness and nonviolence.


#### Mimetic Desire and the Role of Platonism in Evil and Redemption

**Girard's Perspective on Mimetic Desire:**
- Christians should compel rivals to imitate them, leading to positive imitation (Girard, 40)
- Gospels recognize mimetic character of human relations (Girard, 41)
- Christ asks imitators to drop out of mimetic competition (Girard, 42)

**Mimetic Desire:**
- Can be a remedy or poison, depending on the object imitated
- Plato's "mimetic ontology" in Republic: desire for immaterial forms like justice (509–511)
- Forms engender no competition and violence due to being non-finite (Plato)
- Christ's love is radically inclusive, cannot provoke rivalries (Girard, 43)
- Revocation of mimetic desire for physical objects necessary (Buddhism)

**Postmodern Critique of Platonism:**
- Postmodern argument: Platonism causes fascistic ethic and violence (Nietzsche, Heidegger)
- Postwar Europe's efforts to understand radical evil in the twentieth century (Arendt)
- Antimetaphysical, anti-Platonic postmodern reason as solution for evil (Arendt)

**Girard vs. Postmodern Critique:**
- Girard affirms a kind of mimetic Platonism qua Christianity
- Postmodern critique of idealistic Platonism: Plato's originals cause fascism, violence (Heidegger)
- Arendt's argument: banality of evil and techne model of politics lead to radical evil.


### Chapter 2. Nietzsche’s Religious Hermeneutics

**Nietzsche's Religious Hermeneutics**

**Girard on Nietzsche**:
- Nietzsche is a key philosopher and theologian in understanding Christianity's essence, despite his criticism of it
- Nietzsche sees the unique difference between Christianity and other mythologies: the moral interpretation of collective violence with regard to the victim

**Dionysus versus the "Crucified"**:
- **Dionysus**: Represents affirmation of life, vitality, and necessary violence in cycles
- **Christianity**: Condemns violence, sees suffering as a path to holy existence
- Nietzsche's affirmation of Dionysus is an affirmation of violence toward victims, which may be seen as justification for human sacrifice

**Girard on Nietzsche and Christianity**:
- Nietzsche discovered the "anthropological key" to Christianity: the concern for victims
- The Nazis found support in Nietzsche's philosophy to counter the Christian ethic of concern for victims
- Girard sees Nietzsche as a crucial figure despite his criticism, as he understood the uniqueness of Christianity and its impact on society


#### Nietzsche vs. Christianity: Perspectivism on Sacrifice and Morality

**Nietzsche's Perspective on Christianity and Violence**

**Christianity vs. Dionysianism:**
- Nietzsche sees Christianity as a concern for victims, weak, sick, and ill constituted (WP 246)
- Christianity rejects suffering as necessary for life (Girard)
- Christianity indicts primitive religions and their collective violence as guilty (Girard)

**Perspectivism:**
- Nietzsche believes that there is only a perspective seeing and knowing (WP 246)
- Different perspectives: masters vs. slaves, Dionysus vs. Crucified

**Master Morality vs. Slave Morality:**
- Masters represent active, noble existence that affirms power
- Slaves are reactive, full of resentment against those who are more powerful (GM 1:10)
- Slaves create values around their weakness, such as compassion and pity (GM 1:10)

**Nietzsche's View on Suffering:**
- Affirms suffering as necessary for life (WP 1049, 1050)
- Sees Christianity as rejecting suffering and violence (Girard)

**Critique of Christianity:**
- Nietzsche believes Christianity indicts primitive religions and their collective violence as guilty (Girard)
- Rejects Christianity for its rejection of suffering, innocence of victim, and guilt of persecutors (Girard)

**Nietzsche's Understanding of Human Sacrifice:**
- Nietzsche sees human sacrifice as foundational to the foundation of human culture and society (implied in text)

**Girard's Interpretation of Nietzsche:**
- Girard believes Nietzsche sides with the "mobs" or "persecutors," despising the victims (based on master morality critique)
- Girard notes Nietzsche's rejection of Christianity from the perspective of Dionysianism and its affirmation of suffering.


#### Nietzsche's critique of compassion in relation to Schopenhauer's philosophy and Christianity's focus on victims.

**Nietzsche's View on Cruelty and Human Nature:**

**Primitive Humans**:
- Cruelty was a normal ingredient in their pleasures
- Inflicting punishment had a cathartic effect, balancing debts and guilt

**The Role of Violence in Society**:
- Punishment provided a festive release of primitive emotions
- Violence is the "sacred" essential aspect to "festival" or religion

**Nietzsche's Critique of Christianity**:
- Concern for victims and weakness is what makes Christianity "bad"
- Nietzsche advocates for the weak and ill-constituted to perish, arguing that compassion is a weakness

**Nietzsche vs. Schopenhauer on Compassion:**
- For Schopenhauer, existence is suffering due to the "will to life" and its striving
- Compassion (Mitleid) allows one to overcome the illusion of separateness and experience unity with all of existence
- Nietzsche reinterprets this in Dionysian terms, contrasting rationality (Apollo) with primordial unity and blissful overcoming of separateness (Dionysus).


#### Nietzsche's critique of compassion in Christianity: Dionysus vs. The Crucified

**Nietzsche's Critique of Compassion: Dionysian vs. Christian Perspectives**

**Background:**
- Nietzsche's critique of compassion evolves from Schopenhauerian compassion to a more Darwinian perspective in The Anti-Christ.
- Replacement of nihilistic compassion by the Dionysian, which affirms life.

**Dionysian vs. Christian Perspectives:**
1. **Compassion**:
   - Nietzsche: Depressive, preserves weakness, hostile to life (A 7).
   - Christians: Absolute moral value, highest standing in culture.
2. **Victimization and Violence:**
   - Christianity: Concern for victims, hostility towards violence.
   - Nietzsche/Dionysus: Despises weakness, celebrates strength (hostile to life).
3. **God and Atonement:**
   - Pagans vs. Christians: Dionysian god embraces whole of life vs. wholly good, nonviolent Christian God.
   - Nietzsche: Anti-natural castration of a God into a God of the merely good (A 16).
4. **Essence of Jesus's Teaching:**
   - Christians: Life of love and nonviolence.
   - Nietzsche: Agrees on the facts but disagrees on perspective.
5. **Conclusion**:
   - Nietzsche and Girard agree on the essence of Christianity regarding victimization, violence, and God's atonement; they merely disagree on the better perspective.


#### Nietzsche's complex interpretation of Jesus, will to power, and violence.

**Nietzsche's Understanding of Jesus**
- Nietzsche compares Jesus to "the Idiot" from Dostoyevsky's novel (A 29)
- Jesus is described as joyous, full of life and goodness, but misunderstood by the world, especially his followers
- The "profoundest saying of the Gospels" for Nietzsche is "resist not evil" (A 29)
- Nietzsche admires the historical Jesus, who was free of resentment and full of love (A 39)
- Jesus seems to occupy a middle position outside the dichotomy of "Christianity" and "Dionysus" (A 39)
- Nietzsche contrasts the historical Jesus with Pauline Christianity, which he sees as distorting the former in the spirit of resentment (A 39)

**Girard's Perspective on Nietzsche and Resentment**
- Girard agrees with Nietzsche that the essence of Christ's teachings is the love of enemies and nonresistance to violence (not commented by Nietzsche)
- Girard believes Nietzsche misunderstands his own concept of ressentiment in relation to will to power (see below)
- For Girard, resentment is a form of mimetic desire, not a quality possessed by the victim as Nietzsche seems to suggest (A 39)
- Will to power and mimetic desire are intertwined for Girard; will to power is simply competitive and violent, leading to resentment (see below)

**Heidegger's Interpretation of Nietzsche's Metaphysics**
- Heidegger sees Nietzsche as a metaphysician, primarily concerned with overcoming metaphysics (not explicitly addressed by Nietzsche)
- Heidegger identifies the will to power and eternal return as Nietzsche's fundamental ontological categories (Being and Becoming) (Heidegger, Nietzsche)
- The essence of will to power is positing and stabilizing reality in the form of "values" to promote life, which are then overcoming for a heightened sense of power (WP 715)
- Will to power operates by creating values as challenges or resistances to be overcome, similar to how beings are constantly striving to increase their feeling of power.


#### Will to power as becoming: the endless cycle of overpowering and destruction.

**Will to Power and Becoming**

**Essence of Will to Power:**
- Stabilizes chaos into stability for increase of power
- Challenges itself toward ever more power
- Creating and destroying values as resistances
- No telos, only endless striving for more power

**Identical to Becoming:**
- Ossification and destabilization of reality
- Process of overpowering power
- Animation of will to power as fundamental trait of beings

**Eternal Return of the Same:**
- Will to power discloses itself as Eternal Return
- Dialectically, thinking essence of will to power leads to thinking becoming's essence
- Essence of beings is will to power and occurs eternally

**Affirmation of Life:**
- Embraces violence and cruelty as essential to human existence
- Nietzsche's metaphysics of will to power's endlessly becoming grounds mythic violence
- Mythic violence becomes transparent in Nietzsche's thought, yet affirmed.

**Will to Power and Eternal Return:**
- Identified with each other as processes of overpowering power
- Grounds the inner logic of mythic cyclical violence
- Resurrection of myth by Nietzsche, affirming its original place and violence.

**Metaphysics of Will to Power:**
- Affirmation of life's endless cyclical process, including violence and cruelty
- Myth becomes self-aware of its brutality while still affirming itself
- Christianity destroys myth by exposing its essence but Nietzsche seeks to restore it.


#### Nietzsche's critique of metaphysics: Overcoming revenge and Platonism through becoming and will to power

**Nietzsche's Critique of Metaphysics: Overcoming Revenge and Being**

**Nietzsche's Error:**
- Nietzsche's only error was choosing violence against the innocent truth of the victim, a truth he himself glimpsed.
- This resulted from his siding with Dionysian mania against the weakness of victims, whom he regarded as inferior.

**Nietzsche's Attack on Christianity and Platonism:**
- Nietzsche's metaphysical attack targeted Christianity's Platonic core, the theory of the dual world.
- He saw this split between becoming and being as a form of ressentiment or revenge against reality.

**Metaphysical Ressentiment:**
- Revenge hates time, passing, and impermanence; it revolts against becoming.
- Metaphysical resentment goes deeper than mere resentment against the noble and powerful.
- It resents the heart of reality itself, which is becoming.

**The Meaning of Revenge:**
- Revenge creates the other "true" world of being as a mythical stand-in for the true world.
- God is just another concept arising from this spirit of revenge against time, becoming, and reality.

**Nietzsche's Overcoming Metaphysics:**
- Nietzsche aimed to replace Platonic metaphysics with a world of becoming.
- To overcome resentment and revenge is to overcome being, which motivates the transcendence from the physical world to the metaphysical one.

**The Essence of Nietzsche's Overturning of Platonism:**
- Being has no ontological status in Nietzsche's world; it is a mere "vapor."
- Being is a temporary phenomenon grounded in the transitory ossification of becoming wrought by the will to power.

**Art and Value Creation:**
- In place of imitating transcendent patterns, one must become an artist who consciously stabilizes becoming into being and creates values.
- Art mimics or imitates the Dionysian world in its continual creativity and destruction.


#### Nietzsche's Dionysian art: Creating values through will to power, overcoming Platonism and truth.

**Nietzsche's Concept of Art and Mimesis**

**Dionysian Imitation**:
- No original to imitate or copy
- Creates originally from the will to power itself
- Mimes the original activity of the will to power

**Art as Will to Power**:
- Art is the process of will to power's forming of becoming into being
- Recognizes that there is no truth, only lies created by the will to power
- Consciously acknowledges art as a lie that "being is becoming"

**Nietzsche vs. Platonism**:
- Nietzsche overturns Platonism and mimesis
- Art takes precedence over truth, which is a mere fiction of the creative reactivity of resentment

**Art as Self-Referential Mimesis**:
- Mimesis imitates only itself, not some pregiven original
- Nietzsche's desire for complete originality (Übermensch) remains an impossible fantasy

**Girard's Critique of Nietzsche**:
- Nietzsche's metaphysics of violence leads to the ideology of mimetic desire
- Nietzsche's affirmation of Dionysian madness and disgust for compassion is anti-Christian
- Nazism can be seen as an extension of Nietzsche's philosophy of self-mastery and affirmation of violence

**Girard's Concept of "Victim Power"**:
- Postwar Europe and America have a new fascism that affirms violence, but only in the name of victims
- This persecution of perceived "perpetrators" is a reconfiguration of mythic violence


### Chapter 3. Heidegger’s Violent Sacred

**Heidegger's Approach to Metaphysics: Overcoming Being**

**Background:**
- Heidegger concerned with the "overcoming of metaphysics" through a suspicious hermeneutic
- Seeks to unearth metaphysics' unthought grounds, or conditions for possibility
- Critical of the question of what as limiting and concealing the question of how

**Understanding Heidegger's Terminology:**
- Being (das Sein, das Seyn): the fundamental question in Heidegger's philosophy
- Transcending beings to their beingness: metaphysics studies being qua being
- Metata phusika ("beyond the physical"): name for the philosophical discipline that passes beyond beings to their beingness

**Heidegger's Critique of Metaphysics:**
- Concealed or forgotten question of how: the "forgetting of being" (Vergessenheit des Seins)
- Questions metaphysics' conditions and why it is possible to ask the question of why
- Deconstructive approach using phenomenology to allow for disclosure of conditions behind questions

**Key Concepts:**
- Being: fundamental question in Heidegger's philosophy
- Transcendence: name for passing beyond beings to their beingness
- Metaphysics: philosophical discipline that studies being qua being.


#### Exploring Heidegger's idea of nothing as the condition for metaphysical transcendence

**Heidegger's Phenomenological Method**

**Disclosure of Metaphysics**:
- Deconstructive and phenomenological process
- Reveals what lies "behind" metaphysics
- Allows for a disclosure of a being's "truth"

**The Role of Nothing (Das Nichts)**:
- Condition for metaphysics
- Enables the distinction between apparent and true world
- Occasion for transcendence from a being to its being or essence

**Beyng (Das Seyn) vs. Being (Das Sein)**:
- Beyng is the condition for possibility of being
- Transcendence from a being to its being enabled by "perceiving of nothing"

**The Event (Das Ereignis)**:
- Enables metaphysics and human abstract thinking
- Consists of truth, beyng, and nothing
- Occasioned by the transcendence of a thing's essence through the nothing

**Metaphysics and the Forgetting of Beyng (Das Seyn)**:
- Condition for metaphysics is perpetually concealed
- Concealment enables thinking as transcendence to occur
- "Forgetting of beyng" is a withdrawal by beyng itself

**Overcoming Metaphysics**:
- Recognition of the concealed condition of metaphysics begins the process
- Reductionism in metaphysics reduces the meaning of beyng to one sense or showing


#### Exploring Heidegger's perspective on metaphysics, transcendence, and the withdrawal of being

**Metaphysics: Transcendence and Reductionism**

**Key Concepts:**
- **Reductionism in Metaphysics**: limiting being's being to essence, eclipsing the deeper transcendental question of how.
- **Transcending Metaphysics**: revealing beyng through "how" instead of just "what or why".
- **Metaphysics as Transcendence**: humans think and transcend beings to their intelligibility; we are metaphysics ourselves.
- **Dasein**: human being's unique ability to separate from themselves, exist in multiple ways, and choose who they are to be.
- **Equivocation in Metaphysics**: Dasein as metaphysics (transcendence) vs. reductionistic metaphysics (singular meaning).

**Reductionism in Modernity:**
- Conceiving human self as "just" physical body or brain chemistry: reductionistic framework (Gestell).
- Human beings as dominators and masters of nature: Nietzschean will to power, mastery over becoming.
- Reduction of beings' meaning to singular meaning (power and manipulability).

**Effects of Reductionism:**
- Concealment of beyng's polyvalence and multitude of possibilities.
- Forgetting withdrawal of beyng itself: beings have only one meaning, truth as revealing and concealing is hidden, concealment itself is concealed.

**Thinking Concealment:**
- Understanding the polyvalence of being's possibilities (satoated perspectivism).
- Beings show themselves in many ways; human subject does not determine or impose meaning but reveals beyng.


#### Exploring Heidegger's and Girard's interpretations of Greek Logos and its connection to violence and the sacred.

**Heidegger's Perspective on Beyng and Metaphysics:**
* **Beyng conceals itself**: not just in metaphysics but shows itself in Nietzschean, subjective fashion
* **Self-deification of humans**: result of beyng's withdrawal, leading to human beings as ultimate arbitrators of value and creators of meaning
* **Implications for religion and the sacred**: eclipse or "flight" of gods and holy; considered merely subjective beliefs in modern metaphysics
* **Heidegger's project**: overcoming or "twisting free" of metaphysics, reinvigorating the sacred, remythologizing reality.

**Girard's Interpretation:**
* **Distinction between Greek and Hebraic Logos**: decisive break with metaphysical tradition
* **Pre-Socratic Greek philosophy**: abstraction from religion, particularly Heraclitus' Logos as violent unification of opposites (polemos)
* **Scapegoat mechanism**: prevents destruction among doubles through violence; originates in mythic sacred activity or "logic" of scapegoating.

**Heidegger and Girard on the Sacred:**
* Heidegger: eclipse of beyng amounts to concealment of the sacred, nihilistic implication for Western culture
* Girard: affirms violence and sacrifice as essential aspects of human culture; sees Heidegger's project as restoring mythic sacred place in human life.

**Key Insights from Heidegger:**
* Beyng conceals itself but shows itself in subjective fashion, leading to human self-deification and reduction of reality to raw material
* Distinction between Greek and Hebraic Logos: crucial break with metaphysical tradition
* Originary unity of mythos and Logos.


#### Platonic Dialogues: Mythos, Logos, and the Violent Sacred in Plato, Heidegger, and Girard.

**Sallis's Interpretation of Platonic Dialogues and Heidegger's Concept of Logos**

**Platonic Dialogues**:
- Each dialogue attempts to mirror a certain mythos (mythology) in Logos (philosophy) and ergon (deed)
- Example: Phaedo - establishes a Logos of the soul vis-à-vis Pythagorean and Orphic myths on transmigration of the soul through the "deed" or death of Socrates

**Girard's Argument**:
- Logos reflects and mirrors mythos, as operative in Plato himself

**Heidegger's Interpretation of Heraclitus' Fragment 53**:
- **Polemos** (conflict, struggle) creates a world, establishing human beings and gods, slaves and freemen
- Polemos and Logos are the same - "Logos as polemos"
- Tragic nature of existence: reveal vs conceal, both necessary

**Heidegger vs Girard on Logos**:
- Heidegger sees Greek Logos as essentially tragic, rooted in violence (polemos)
- Christian Logos (Gospel of John) is not the "being of beings" or gathering, but **mesites** (mediator) - Christ as mediator between God and humans
- Heidegger wants to return to original Greek meaning of Logos, opposing Christian interpretation
- Girard sees Heidegger's findings as uncovering the fundamental violence at the heart of beyng, the sacred

**Heidegger's Task**:
- Overcome metaphysics by investigating its origins and deconstructing conceptions of Logos to reveal original Greek experience of existence.


#### Exploring the connection between Logos and violence in Greek and Christian philosophy

**Girard's Interpretation of the Christian Logos vs Platonic Logos:**

**Essence of the Christian Logos:**
- Unique for suffering expulsion
- Reveals truth about human beings and their relationship with God
- Not violent, but receives violence
- Victim, persecuted

**John's Prologue:**
- Logos comes into the world and is not recognized or received
- Expelled, tortured, and crucified
- Humans reject God, not vice versa
- Reversal of original understanding of relationship between God and humans

**Platonic Logos:**
- Mediator and gathering principle
- Collects many particulars into one
- Nonviolent act or hiding its violent origins
- Necessity for violence only in a Nietzschean metaphysics where the world is inherently disordered.

**Heidegger's Logos:**
- Concealed in metaphysics and Platonic tradition
- Experience of being not recovered
- Divine given limited space to appear (ontotheology)
- Metaphysical reductionism: essence as ultimate ground or God.

**Connection between Heidegger's Logos and Violent Sacred:**
- Question remains on evidence linking Heidegger's conception of the holy to violent sacred
- Heidegger deals with religion through Platonic metaphysical tradition
- Reductionism inherent in Platonism: essence as ultimate ground, God.


#### Heidegger's deconstruction of Logos and its connection to the divine, ontotheology, and violence.

**Heidegger's Critique of Ontotheology**

**Ontotheology**:
- Interpreting Logos as merely synonymous with ratio, causal nexus, substance, and causality
- Leads to a theoretical blasphemy by limiting the way the holy can be conceived

**Overcoming Ontotheology**:
- Heidegger's challenge to overcoming ontotheology through deconstructing Logos
- Logos is not immediately equatable with ratio, reason, or legein as mere saying/speaking
- Logos means primarily the gathering of the many into one

**Logos as Aletheia**:
- Logos as aletheia: truth as unconcealment
- Logos gathers beings in their manyness, concealing and revealing them
- Unites opposites (one to many) through the activity of Logos

**Theology Emerging from Logos**:
- Zeus shows himself in the disclosive gathering activity of Logos
- Gods appear out of the happening of being, which is the happening of truth as unconcealment
- The one cannot be severed from the many; the divine activity must include its violent aspect (polemos)

**Heidegger's Exploration of Divinity**:
- Heidegger's excursion into the theological goes beyond "Introduction to Metaphysics" and "Logos" essay
- In "The Origin of the Work of Art" (1936), he delves deeper into the divine activity within art as mimesis.


#### Heidegger's interpretation of art as reflexive mimesis of truth and conflict.

**Heidegger's View on Art as Reflexive Mimesis:**
- Art imitates beyng as the happening of truth (aletheia)
- Not a reproduction of particular entities, but imitates their essence or universal
- Does not imitate a pregiven original, but lets essence come into being in the act itself
- Reflexive mimesis: images forth the idea of imaging
- Imagines original strife (polemos) between earth and world
- Earth: raw stuff of existence that resists disclosure, corresponds to concealment
- World: open relational context of meaning, corresponds to disclosure
- Polemos: confliction-union of earth and world grounded in primal strife of revealing and concealing truth
- Artwork is mimesis of polemos, imitates violence as the heart of beyng
- Logos: language gathers beings together, illuminates them, poetic saying unites earth and world in their strife.

**Language and Poetry:**
- Language brings beings into open for first time through naming
- Naming allows appearance of beings in their Being as one and many
- Projective saying: release of illumination that infuses itself into beings, renunciation of confusion
- Poetic or mythic sayings gather world and earth in their strife, open space for "nearness and remoteness" of gods.

**Heidegger's Example: The Greek Temple:**
- Temple as work of art imitates god, opens up world as network of meaning for historical people
- Struggle between earth (concealment) and world (disclosure) in the temple
- Claritas of beauty shines forth from this conflict, makes god present and is god himself.


#### Heidegger's interpretation of violence and the sacred in Greek culture and philosophy

**Heidegger's Understanding of the Holy**

**The Temple**:
- Gives things their "look" (Gesicht) and humans their outlook on themselves
- Allows the god to be present in the sculpture, making it the god itself

**Tragedy**:
- Reenacts the struggle (Kampf) between the new and old gods
- Delimits the relationship between gods and men, masters and slaves
- Foundational for culture

**Polemos and Logos**:
- Polemos (violence, conflict) and Logos (Word, discourse) are synonymous
- The polemical gathering of opposites is essential to beyng

**Heidegger's Interpretation of Sophocles' Antigone**:
- Deinon: Greek term meaning "uncanny" or "violent"
- Humans feel displaced and overwhelmed by the nature of beings
- Human violence (Gewalt) is a response to this, forming and molding reality
- This poetic act of naming and gathering is the foundation of culture


#### Heidegger's interpretation of poetry and violence in human existence and culture.

**Heidegger's Understanding of Violence and Culture:**

**Violence in Humanity:**
- Response to violence of being itself (aletheia)
- Human beings as Da-sein: place where being discloses itself
- Disclosure of being is a violent process
- Logos, polemos, and aletheia: same reality, inherent violence
  - Techne: setting Being into appearance as beings
  - Dikē: fittingness or overwhelming power of beings
  - Violence in human clashes with the fittingness of reality
  - Founding of culture through poetic act (Logos)

**Poetry and the Divine:**
- Language: most innocent and dangerous thing
- Primary event (das jenige Ereignis): naming gods into being
- Human beings as conversation based on language and nomination of gods
- Gods come to expression through worlding of a world
  - Naming of gods founds a world
- Poets deliver divine gift in song to the people
- Human existence is poetic: poets stand in presence of gods

**Heidegger's Reflections on Hölderlin:**
- Unique poet who poetizes about essence of poetry itself
- Essence of poetry and founding of a world
- Focus on Logos (language) as both creative and destructive
- Primary event (das jenige Ereignis): naming gods into being
  - Human beings as conversation based on language and nomination of gods
- Divine revelation through poetic naming: disclosure of beings by beyng/truth is contingent upon it.


#### Heidegger's analysis of poetry, divine madness, and the sacred. Poets as exiled mediators between gods and men. The holy as chaos, violent emergence of meaning and being.

**The Poetic Act: Tragedy and the Founding of Culture (Heidegger's Reflections)**

**Poetry as Dangerous Occupation:**
- Poets are tempted to madness due to standing in presence of sacred
- Heidegger reads Hölderlin's "Empedocles" as poet's premonition of own expulsion
- Poet must appear harmless and innocent, like a game, for the founding of culture

**The Poetic Act as Tragedy:**
- Poet sacrifices himself to allow sacred to come into world
- Exiled from ordinary life as mediator between gods and men
- Expulsion necessary during middle period of messianism (time of need)
- Nature, phusis, holds opposites in unity and allows for appearance of gods

**The Holy: Chaos and the Self-Bestowal of the Divine:**
- The holy is chaos that gives birth to gods and men
- Nature is essential to the holy as a continual springing forth of meaning
- The holy's self-bestowal threatens its own nature, causing suffering
- Interpreted by Heidegger as anti-Christian in Hölderlin's "As When on a Holiday..." poem.

**Key Concepts:**
- Poetry: dangerous occupation, Tragedy, Expulsion of the poet, The holy (chaos), Nature, phusis, Self-bestowal of divine, Middle period of messianism.


#### Heidegger's interpretation of the holy as tragic being and poetic existence.

**The Nature of Beyng: Heidegger's Philosophy on the Holy as Tragic**

**Understanding Beyng: Essential Self-Sacrifice in the Self-Bestowal of the Holy**

**Heidegger's Interpretation of the Holy (phusis, beyng)**
- Primordial suffering and self-threatening
- Intimacy that gathers everything to itself
- Essential violence and self-violence in its own self-bestowal
- Synonymous with the messianic "to come"

**The Role of Poetry and the Thinker**
- Calling word for anticipating the coming holy
- Grounds another beginning of a new culture
- Philosophy as tragic: thinking beyng as to its essence is redundant, both beyng and thinker suffer a tragic fate

**Heidegger's Thoughts on Tragic Fate**
- Beyng must withdraw in favor of beings
- Thinker called to think self-expulsion risks expulsion
- Poet as the one to come grounds a world by naming the new god (last god)

**The Transcendence of Metaphysics**
- Deconstructing metaphysics' conditions is necessary to traverse to an "other beginning" beyond metaphysics.


#### Heidegger's thinking on beyng and overcoming metaphysics through violence and tragedy.

**Heidegger's Philosophy: Overcoming Metaphysics and Beyng**

**The Tragic Fate of Metaphysics**:
- Metaphysics suffered from a "tragic fate" by beginning with the forgetting of beyng's withdrawal
- This led to various instantiations of being as essence, ground, etc., which finally exhausted itself in Nietzsche

**Transcending Metaphysics: Recognizing Beyng's Tragic Fate**:
- Thinking that overcomes metaphysics recognizes the tragic fate of beyng's self-expulsion
- This does not mean the thinking of "other beginning" is free from tragedy itself
- Heidegger sees the history of beyng as a "fate" (Geschick) sent by beyng itself

**Parallels Between Heidegger and Girard**:
- Both recognize the expelling at the heart of beyng and the sacred, respectively
- However, Heidegger's holy remains "the entirely other against all previous gods, especially against the Christian god"

**Heidegger's Criticisms of Christianity**:
- Heidegger believes Christianity is wedded to Platonic metaphysics that led to modern technology's domination of nature
- He sees Nietzsche as the culmination of this, where the human thinks himself as "master and possessor" of nature

**Heidegger's Three Phases in His Thinking**:
1. From Catholicism to Protestantism (Marburg and Freiburg periods)
2. Turn toward heroic voluntarism lauding Nietzscheanism
3. Move beyond Nietzsche to a mythopoetic meditation on the gods and the holy, neopaganism (Gelassenheit)

**A More Radical Kehre in Heidegger's Thinking**:
- A more radical Kehre occurs once Heidegger begins to break with his obsession with polemos at the heart of beyng
- This happens between his first and second Nietzsche lectures (circa 1936)
- Heidegger starts to view Nietzsche in a more negative light, holding him responsible for the metaphysics of modern technology

**Heidegger's Concept of Techne**:
- Techne is no longer thought as a violent (deinon) activity that harnesses nature's violence
- It becomes a meditative thinking that "lets be" by willing to not-will

**Gelassenheit: Antithesis to Violence and Metaphysics of the Will**:
- Gelassenheit remains wholly antithetical to violence and the metaphysics of will to power
- It names the complete antithesis to the will to power and its violence toward nature in modernity's Gestell and reductionistic framework

**Heidegger's Criticisms of Christianity Never Cease**:
- Heidegger still sees Christianity as ontotheology, wedded to Platonic metaphysics that leads to Nietzscheanism
- Understanding the world as created (implying a creator) leads to the modern metaphysics of technology, where God "dies" and the human subject takes its place


#### Heidegger's critique of Christianity: Reason as violent and blasphemous, essentialism vs. voluntarism, and the resurrection of the violent sacred.

**Heidegger's Critique of Christianity and Reason**

**Heidegger's Critique of Christianity**:
- Faults Christianity for rootedness in a productive, technological Comportment of the human being
- Deifies the human being as the master of nature
- Sees this as the metaphysical root of violence

**Ontotheological Critique**:
- Blasphemously eclipses the true holy in favor of theoretical distortion
- Conceiving God as "creator" is a distortion and assault on the holy
- Argues there is a "straight line" from conceiving God as creator to the metaphysics of the will to power in modern technology

**Reason and Violence**:
- Heidegger implicitly questions the nature and function of reason itself as perhaps inherently violent
- Nietzsche's argument that Platonism (and Christianity) necessitates a "fascism of truth" that eventuates in violence
- This logic can only be argued from an amoral perspective where violence constitutes the essence of thought itself

**Luther's Critique of Reason**:
- Luther advocated for an anti-essentialist position, favoring beings not as they are but as they will be
- Reason, along with its metaphysics of essences, must undergo a theological transformation
- Attack on essentialism cuts to the heart of metaphysics itself as a theory of essences

**Implications**:
- Critique of cause (der Grund) foregone in favor of God's "will"
- Essence and nature no longer applicable to the divine
- Allows for violence to enter into the Godhead
- Resurrection of the mythic, violent sacred?

**Heidegger's Task**:
- Deconstruct Christianity's unholy marriage with Greek metaphysics, particularly Aristotelianism.


#### Luther's critique of Aristotle's ethics and its implications for evil and human agency in Christianity.

**Aristotle's Impact on Luther**
- Aristotle's Metaphysics and Ethics problematic for Luther due to:
  - Essentialism in Metaphysics contradicted Luther's beliefs
  - Emphasis on human effort for righteousness in Ethics (works-based theory) opposed sola fide (justification by faith alone)
- **Sola Fide**: central tenet of Luther's theology, distinguishing it from Aristotle's ethic
- Luther sees Aristotle's ethic as "antigrace" and an enemy of justification by faith alone
- Human will is impotent according to Luther, leading to radical determinism and questioning of free will

**The Problem of Evil**
- If humans possess no free will, they are not responsible for evil; origin resides in God's "hidden will"
- This reinscribes violence within the divine (mythic sacred)
- Heidegger's essence of evil as part of beyng's truth and concealing nature

**Antiessentialism and Critique of Ontotheology**
- Critique of ontotheology need not lead to an "ontology of violence" or extreme voluntarism concerning the divine
- God can be rendered powerless by placing human concession and permission for existence
- Heidegger's later thinking favors radical passivity in Gelassenheit, but becomes more sacramental with regard to reality and the sacred.


#### Heidegger and Girard: Interpreting Hölderlin's Divine Withdrawal.

**Heidegger's Rethinking of Poetry and Logos**

**Poetry as Sacramental Imaging of God**:
- Heidegger rethinks poetry as a sacramental imaging of God, not a violent act against nature.
- This imaging occurs through human kindness, which need not be "artistic" but the disclosure of beauty itself.

**Girard's Critique of Heidegger**:
- Girard critiques Heidegger's understanding of Logos, particularly the Greek vs. Hebraic interpretations.
- Heidegger sides with the "violent, polemos -Logos", while Girard sides with the "Christian Logos of expulsion".
- However, Girard lauds Heidegger for disclosing the fundamental distinction between these two Logoses.

**Girard's "Deconstructive" Reading of Heidegger**:
- Girard's reading mirrors his reading of Nietzsche: he praises Heidegger for disclosing a fundamental insight, but disagrees on the interpretation.

**Girard's Critique of Heidegger's Reading of Hölderlin**:
- Heidegger attempted to excise Hölderlin's Christianity in favor of his Grecophilia.
- Girard understands Hölderlin's "Patmos" poem as speaking about the withdrawal of the divine, which he sees as a positive withdrawal of Christ that we are to imitate.

**Girard's Interpretation vs. Heidegger's**:
- For Girard, Heidegger's understanding of the withdrawal of being merely names the positive withdrawal of the primitive sacred.
- The danger is the cessation of the sacrificial mechanism, which could lead to catastrophic destruction without the containment of the scapegoat system.
- However, through imitating Christ's withdrawal on the cross, we can move from reciprocity to relationship and true love of neighbor.

**Link Between Heidegger and Girard**:
- They both hermeneutically unmask the violence underlying systems, be it metaphysical reductionism or mimetic rivalry.


### Chapter 4. A Girardian Critique of Postmodernity

**Girard's Critique of Postmodernity: The Resurrection of Ontotheology**

**Understanding Girard's Perspective**:
- He often emphasized that his mimetic theory is not novel, as Augustine had already explored similar ideas.
- However, his understanding of Judeo-Christianity as a revelation of the scapegoat mechanism is a significant contribution to twentieth-century philosophy and theology.

**Girard's Compatibility with Church Doctors**:
- Girard's view of scripture extends beyond the biblical text itself to include the entire corpus of theology and its axioms.
- This idea is similar to how Aquinas understood "scripture," which allowed for further truths to be deduced.

**Critique of Metaphysics and Ontotheology**:
- Luther and Heidegger introduced the idea that scripture needed to be disentangled from theology, as the latter is seen as a Greek or pagan view of the world.
- Girard's mimetic theory is both laudatory and critical of Greek thinking and Catholicism's appropriation of it.
- He recognizes that Plato first understood the mimetic structure in all of reality, but criticizes Plato for not recognizing mimetic crises among doubles.

**Plato's Recognition of Mimetic Theory**:
- Plato recognized the violence inherent in tragedy and the need for human imitation to have recourse to the "other world."
- He expelled tragic poets who imitated the finite, visible world, and presented a philosophical mimetic theory that imitates the divine ideas or forms.
- However, Girard criticizes Plato for his arbitrary violence in this process and lauds deconstructionists for uncovering hidden violent elements within Platonism.

**Plato's Scapegoating of Poets**:
- Girard views Plato's expulsion of the poets as a "Satan casting out Satan," a violence fighting violence.
- The Platonic rejection of tragic violence is itself violent, and Derrida's analysis in "Plato's Pharmacy" uncovers Plato's use of the ambiguous pharmakon, which may indicate a violent structure inherent in Platonism.


#### A critique of postmodernism's relativism and its connection to Christianity, Platonism, and Nietzsche's hermeneutics of suspicion.

**Girard's Relationship with the Metaphysical Tradition**
- Girard's perspective on metaphysics:
  * Affirmation of essentialism in Christian theism
  * God is uniquely "good" and "loving," not beyond good and evil
  * Importance of preserving the supersensible Platonic realm for proper mimesis
- Critique of Nietzsche and Heidegger's postmodernism:
  * Rejection of Platonism and metaphysics as the cause of violence
  * Call to overcome and deconstruct metaphysical reality
- Girard's perspective on postmodern relativism:
  * Criticism of anti-Platonic, anti-ontotheological critique
  * Suspicion towards nonrational elements concealed behind rationality.

**Girard vs. Postmodernism: A Comparison**
| **Topic** | **Girard's Viewpoint** | **Postmodern Perspective (Nietzsche, Heidegger)** |
|---|---|---|
| Metaphysics and Essentialism | Affirmation of essentialism in Christian theism | Rejection of Platonism and metaphysics as the cause of violence |
| God's Nature | Uniquely "good" and "loving," not beyond good and evil | Not mentioned specifically |
| Preserving the Supersensible Realm | Necessary for proper mimesis | Ignores or criticizes it |
| Rationality | Values truth, seeks stability in reality | Suspicion towards rationality, advocates nonrational elements |
| Truth and Reality | Desire for an intelligible reality behind phenomena | Denial of metaphysical reality or reduction to univocity |
| Concern for Victims | Not explicitly mentioned | Central focus on victims' concern |

**Nietzsche's Critique of Modern Science and Rationality**
- Nietzsche's view on modern science's will to truth:
  * Atheistic modern science remains hypocritical in seeking truth, as it is ultimately rooted in Christian faith.


#### Nietzsche's critique of modern science: Truth as a metaphysical holdover from theism and the need for immanent critique.

**The Metaphysical Hangover from Theism in Modern Science**

**Atheistic Modern Science and the "Death of God"**
- Atheistic modern science has failed to recognize that the belief in the rational order of reality is a metaphysical holdover from theism
- The idea of truth as an objective, unchanging reality is akin to faith in a transcendent God
- Modern science represents the latest incarnation of the "ascetic ideal," denying the phenomenal world for a transcendent one

**The Belief in Truth as Metaphysical**
- Nietzsche argues that belief in truth is a metaphysical faith, similar to faith in God
- Science's belief in truth perpetuates a "pale atheism" and Christian ideals, despite its attempt to overcome theism
- The value of truth has not been critically examined by modern science

**Nietzsche's Perspectivism as Postmodernism**
- Nietzsche's perspectivism challenges the notion of absolute truths and embraces multiple perspectives
- This "postmodern" stance, however, remains concealed from its Christian roots

**The Concern for Victims as a Moral Absolute**
- Despite postmodernism's claim to plurality, the concern for victims remains an indissoluble moral absolute
- Nietzsche critiques this instinct as a result of habituation in Christianity, rather than an objective virtue


#### Nietzsche's critique of modern ethics: Why the obsession with victims?

**Nietzsche's Perspectivalism and the Christian Ethic of Compassion**

**Questioning the Moral Absolute:**
- Nietzsche challenges us to consider why we side with victims, a perspective he questions as potentially mere conditioning
- Pre-Christian ethical systems did not prioritize siding with the weak
- The term "virtus" in Latin means "power," and the Greek aret ē comes from the same root as "aristocratic" or "noble"

**Postmodern Culture's Hyper-Christian Ethic:**
- Modern culture, despite claiming perspectivalism, is rooted in a Christian ethic of concern for victims
- This ethic is unhinged from any metaphysical grounding and fused with an obsession with publicly shaming and condemning victimizers
- Permissiveness towards violence exists when it's done in the name of defending victims

**Postmodernism's Contradictory Elements:**
- A critique of reason, truth, essentialism, etc., as "the death of [the Judeo-Christian] God"
- Affirmation and entrenchment of the Christian ethic under the guise of "difference," "alterity," or concern for those who are excluded and marginalized

**Marxist Interpretations:**
- Postmodernism can be seen as a reconfiguration of Marxism, focusing on collective interpretation through the lens of victimhood and power relations

**Implications:**
- The ethic of victims has become an absolute in postmodern culture, potentially obscuring perspectivalism and pluralism
- Nietzsche's challenge to question this moral absolute remains largely unanswered.


#### A critique of Marxist postmodernism: Violence and victimhood in collectivist ideologies.

**Postmodernism and Neo-Marxism:**

**Characteristics of Postmodernism:**
- Collectivist interpretations of power relations through a victim ethic
  - Race, gender, etc.
- Absolute truth in collectivist terms
- Originated from Marx's hermeneutics of suspicion towards reason

**Criticism of Postmodernism:**
- Lack of individual focus: return to Enlightenment values
- Debt to Judeo-Christian ethic, but distortion through collectivization
  - Concern for victims as Judeo-Christian origin
- Violence inherent in Marxism and postmodernism thwarts revolution

**Girard's Perspective:**
- Recognizes debt to Judeo-Christian ethic
- Criticizes collectivization and violence in neo-Marxism
- Concern for victims can lead to totalitarianism with enforced equality of outcome
- Postmodern culture seeks to defend victims while victimizing victimizers

**Postscript:**
- Dialogues between Girard and philosopher Gianni Vattimo on relativism, nihilism, and postmodernism.


#### A philosophical debate on relativism, Christianity, and truth in the works of Vattimo and Girard

**Girard's Critique of Vattimo's Relativism**

**Vattimo's Ideas**:
- Took from René Girard the idea that God can only be a relativist
- Christianity cannot be reduced to dogmatic propositions, but rather to social relationships
- Relativism amounts to something akin to Heidegger's critique of the metaphysics of presence

**Girard's Criticisms**:
- Claims to understand the practical necessity of identifying as a relativist, but remains critical
- Believes there are objective truths, including the truths of mimetic theory and the victim mechanism in Christianity
- Rejects self-referential inconsistency in relativism
- Criticizes Vattimo's privileging of caritas over veritas

**Girard's Perspective**:
- Believes facts and interpretations are not mutually exclusive
- Regards all positions as equal, but holds that the perspective of the victim is the "true perspective"
- Sees Vattimo's nihilism (relativism) as a misunderstanding of violence
- Argues human violence arises from competition and rivalry, not aggression

**Girard's Conclusion**:
- Postmodern nihilism misunderstands the nature of human beings and violence
- Scapegoats truth as responsible for violence, rather than human beings in their mimetic capacity
- Proper understanding of violence requires acknowledging the truths of mimetic theory
