# Vicos New Science Of The Intersubjective 2016
by Vittorio HöSle Francis R Hittinger 

> Among the classics of the history of philosophy, the Scienza nuova (New Science) by Giambattista Vico (1668–1744) was largely neglected and generally misunderstood during the author's lifetime. From the nineteenth century onwards Vico’s views found a wider audience, and today his influence is widespread in the humanities and social sciences. The New Science is often taught in courses at colleges and universities, both in philosophy and Italian departments and in general humanities courses. Despite the excellent English translations of this enigmatic book and numerous studies in English of Vico, many sections of the work remain challenging to the modern reader. Vico's New Science of the Intersubjective World offers both an in-depth analysis of all the important ideas of the book and an evaluation of their contribution to our present understanding of the social world. In the first chapter, Vittorio Hösle examines Vico’s life, sources, and writings. The second and third chapters discuss the concerns and problems of the Scienza nuova. The fourth chapter traces the broader history of Vico’s reception. Hösle facilitates the understanding of many passages in the work as well as the overarching structure of its claims, which are often dispersed over many sections. Hösle reformulates Vico’s vision in such a way that it is not only of historical interest but may inspire ongoing debates about the nature of the humanities and social sciences as well as many other issues on which Vico sheds light, from the relation of poetry and poetics to the development of law. This book will prepare students and scholars for a precise study of the Scienza nuova, equipping them with the necessary categories and context and familiarizing them with the most important problems in the critical debate on Vico's philosophy. - [Vicos New Science of the Intersubjective](https://www.amazon.com/Vicos-New-Science-Intersubjective-World/dp/0268100284?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

  - Poetic language
  - Insight into archaic forma mentis
  - Revealing deep connections between different facets of human culture and civilization
- Universality of Vico's erudition requires a broadly educated and cultured reader
- Baroque learning, archaizing style, and labyrinthine prose make the work difficult for even an educated reader

**Challenges in Understanding Vico**:
- Writing style and erudition can be perplexing
- Errors in philology, chronology, and biases
- Separating true genius from muddle of times demands focus on essentials

**Approaching Vico's Works**:
- Not a repository for extracting intellectual materials
- Intended to be a systematic whole, not just sundry ideas
- Historical discoveries rooted in metaphysics based on Christian Platonism
- Misinterpretations: not an anticipation of materialism or irrationalism, but rational theory of irrational foundations

**Chapter Outline**:
1. Vico's Life, Sources, and Writings
2. Concerns and Problems in the Scienza nuova
3. Broader History of Vico's Reception and Fortune
4. Preparation for studying the Scienza nuova in detail

#### Exploring Giambattista Vico's intellectual background and controversial ideas, including potential materialistic influences and religious beliefs.

**Cultural Context of Giuseppe Vico's Life and Work**

**Early Neo-Epicureanism in Naples:**
- Discussions taking place in salons
- Academies being founded, including Vico's membership in Accademia degli Uniti (1692)
- Giuseppe Valetta's library as an intellectual hub
- Presence of influential figures like Mabillon and Shaftesbury

**Religious Quietism:**
- Molinos' teachings finding followers

**Neo-Epicurean Ideas in Naples:**
- Materialistic theories of man, history, and Christian origins discussed (Lucretius' De rerum natura)
- Inquisitorial trial on heretical claims (1693)
- Vico's involvement and potential connection to neo-Epicureanism is a subject of debate

**Vico's Early Publication:**
- Affetti di un disperato expressing Lucretian existential desperation (1693)

**Later Life and Catholicism:**
- Controversy over Vico's true beliefs towards Christianity and materialism
- Thesis of crypto-materialist ideas in the SN
- Distinction between objective content and author's intentions
- Self-censorship vs. external censorship
- Intermediate positions on religion: (1) naive consciousness, (2) belief in social utility and absolute truth, (3) critical consciousness hiding beliefs for personal reasons, and (4) heretical-hypocritical consciousness taking only heterodox core seriously while shrouding it in orthodoxy.

**Historical Perspective:**
- Censorship's impact on indirect writing styles
- Rigorous distinction between philosophical history and philological history of philosophy.


#### Neapolitan Scholars: Vico, Giannone, and Influential Historians

**Vico vs. Giannone: Two Neapolitan Enlightenment Figures**

**Differences Between Vico and Giannone:**
- **Religious Background**: Vico was an Italian philosopher who ignored the reactionary consequences of Catholicism in southern Italy, whereas Giannone was a historian whose work primarily treated the contrast between church and state in southern Italy. Giannone's critical views on religion led him to flee Naples and eventually result in his death.
- **Approach to Ancient Philosophers**: While Vico was influenced by Plato and delved into the works of other philosophers like Lucretius, Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Spinoza, Giannone focused on Gassendi and Lucretius in his autobiography.
- **Philosophical Dispositions**: The two thinkers had opposing dispositions; Vico was less modern but more profound, while Giannone was more modern but not as intellectually rigorous.

**Commonalities Between Vico and Giannone:**
- **Study of Ancient Histories**: Both Vico and Giannone studied various classical historians like Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius, Sallust, Caesar, Tacitus, Livy, Varro, Quintilian, Pseudo-Longinus, and Festus.

**Vico's Influences:**
- **Plato**: Vico was influenced by Plato's ideas on how humanity ought to be.
- **Tacitus**: Vico considered Tacitus the most important Roman historian after Plato, as he offered insights into the power of chance and evil in history.
- **Machiavellian Influences**: Machiavelli's work had a significant impact on Vico, particularly his concept of the autonomy of the political sphere.
- **Hobbes**: Vico was influenced by Hobbes's idea of a science concerning the social nature of man, although he believed Hobbes's principles to be specious.
- **Spinoza**: Spinoza's critical method for analyzing the Old Testament inspired Vico's interpretation of classical historical sources instead.


#### Vico's philosophical development and influence from humanism to science

**Vico's Influences on Modern Historical Consciousness**

**Philological-Historical Scholarship**:
- Humanistic desire to understand and imitate "model" classical texts in exhaustive detail
- Juridical need for an up-to-date interpretation of Roman law

**Vico's Approach**:
- Perceived challenge of modern philosophy during formative years
- Option 1: Reject Cartesian epistemological theory while conceding partial validity to it
- Option 2: Constitute historical disciplines as legitimately "scientific" by applying modern scientific ideal

**Vico and Descartes**:
- Vico was deeply agitated by Descartes' challenge to humanistic erudition
- Vico saw Descartes as a lopsided thinker, criticizing his mechanistic-materialistic philosophy of nature and lack of independent moral philosophy

**Vico and Bacon**:
- Bacon recognized modernity's continuity with antiquity more than Descartes
- Vico was influenced by Bacon's theory of poetry and inductive method, as well as his quest for a unified system of sciences

**Vico's Career**:
- Returned to Naples in 1695 and acquainted himself with influential intellectuals
- Made chair of rhetoric at the university in 1699, holding it until 1741
- Dedicated his life's work to expanding and developing Bacon's system by founding a new science

**Vico's Writings**:
- Gave inaugural speeches at the opening of each academic year, published only in the nineteenth century


#### Vico's inaugural speeches and early works: Neoplatonism, Cartesianism, and comparative learning methods.

**Vico's Inaugural Speeches and De Nostri Temporis Studiorum Ratione (On the Study Methods of Our Time)**

**Background:**
- Vico believed in publishing only new and truly original discoveries
- First scholarly publication: De nostri temporis studiorum ratione (1709)
- Contains the seeds of Scienza Nuova (Science New)
- Comparison between ancient and modern learning methods
- Attempts to reconcile Querelle des anciens et des modernes

**Inaugural Speeches:**
- Document Vico's readings from his formative years
- Signal issues that will be fully developed in Scienza Nuova
- First speech: Neoplatonic and Cartesian ideas, recognition of human mind's potential
- Third speech: Ethical standards in scholarly pursuits, criticism of ancient prejudices
- Fourth to fifth speeches: Desire for concrete applications of sciences
- Sixth speech: Establishing order among disciplines, pedagogical considerations

**De Nostri Temporis Studiorum Ratione:**
- Comparison between ancients' and moderns' approaches to learning
- Attempts to put to rest the Querelle des anciens et des modernes
- Recognizes modern method's superiority but cautions against dangers
  - Fragmentation of knowledge, autonomization of disciplines
  - Formation of independent spheres without guiding principle
  - Obliteration of intuitive capacity for adaptation to the world
  - Decay of imagination, poetry, and creativity
- Discussions on various subjects: mathematics, physics, medicine, morality, politics, poetry, theology, jurisprudence
- Importance of method over contents in sciences
  - Admiration for modern discoveries but fear of destruction of sensus communis
  - Criticism depends on topics which can never be replaced by criticism alone
- Preference for ancient medicine due to preventive focus and subordination of rhetoric to philosophy.

**Key Points:**
- Vico's inaugural speeches reflect his intellectual development
- De Nostri Temporis Studiorum Ratione marks Vico's first scholarly publication
- Comparison between ancient and modern learning methods, attempt at reconciliation
- Recognition of the importance of method over contents in sciences.


#### Giambattista Vico's De antiquissima italorum sapientia: Ancient wisdom and the unity of knowledge through the Principle of Verum-Factum

**Regarding the Arts:**
- **Vico's thesis of decline**: Feeling inferior living in a late age, great models from the past stifle creativity.
- Radical idea: Destruction of ancients' masterpieces could revitalize unhindered pursuit of arts (but deemed "atrocious act of barbarism").
- Criticism of modern educational institutions for fragmented knowledge and lack of unity.
- Desire to integrate various disciplines into a single system, harmonizing with religion and political form.

**Vico's Thoughts on Unity of Knowledge:**
- Vico aimed at uniting all human and divine knowledge but failed to achieve it due to insufficient expertise in natural sciences of his time.
- Significant role in methodology of sciences, including exact sciences.
- Effective in integrating human mind philosophy with ancient wisdom through Latin language analysis (De antiquissima italorum sapientia).

**De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia:**
- Goal: Outline a new contemporary philosophy while maintaining it's ancient origins.
- Twofold aim: Identical to metaphysical ideas of most ancient Italians as reconstructed through Latin language.
- Criticized for this approach, but first to submit the idea of hidden wisdom in ancient languages and mythologies to critical scrutiny.

**Liber Metaphysicus:**
- First installment of De antiquissima italorum sapientia.
- Focus on outlining a new philosophy while maintaining its ancient origins.
- Principle of verum-factum: Truth can only be attained when the knowing subject has produced their object.
- Useful in refuting dogmatism and skepticism, befitting human condition.

**Vico's Epistemology:**
- Knowledge of God comes before self-knowledge since God is the one who thinks in us.
- The "cogito ergo sum" is true but not purely scientific knowledge but rather conscious awareness (conscientia).


#### Vico's Liber metaphysicus: Precursor to modern philosophy and exploration of the relationship between knowledge and creation.

**Vico's Philosophy: The Principle of Verum-Factum**

**Background:**
- Vico insists on the importance of the principle of verum-factum for understanding causes
- Connected to knowledge of causes and modern philosophy's development, especially Kant's Copernican revolution
- Differences between Vico and Kant: mathematics' applicability to nature, experimental method, and the role of analysis in science

**Key Concepts:**
1. **The Principle of Verum-Factum**: Prove something from causes is the same as making it (I, p. 149)
2. **Metaphysical Forms vs General Concepts**: Perfect models vs obstructions to understanding concrete reality (I, p. 144ff.)
3. **The Creative Force of Man (ingenium)**: Makes man a quasi-divine creator (I, p. 179, p. 188)
4. **Divine Government and Fortuna**: God's justice accepts private evils for the common good (I, p. 190)
5. **Impia Pietas (Impious Curiosity)**: Proving God a priori leads to creating Him ourselves (I, p. 150)

**Historical Context:**
- Liber metaphysicus caused stir with publication and review in Giornale de' letterati d'Italia (1711)
- Vico responded with Risposta (1712), addressing objections and recanting historical theses.

**Vico's Development:**
- Obscure period between De antiquissima and Diritto universale (matured ideas)

**Metaphysical Points:**
- Metaphysical principles mediate between extended bodies (conatus)
- Similarity to Leibniz's monads but lacks principle of individuality.


#### Historical analysis of Giambattista Vico's works, focusing on his biography and legal studies.

**Vico's Works and Influences**

**Biography of Field Marshall Antonio Caraffa (1713-1715)**
- Vico worked on the biography at the request of a nephew of the Field Marshal, his ex-student
- The work is in four volumes, published in 1716
- Modeled after Tacitus, it is a masterpiece from both a historical and stylistic perspective
- Distracted Vico from philosophy but proved indispensable for his intellectual maturation
- Required extensive study of European history and jurisprudence (international law), particularly Grotius

**Grotius's Influence on Vico**
- Vico began to write a commentary on De iure belli et pacis, discontinued after the second book
- Fascinated by Grotius's union of philosophy, philology, and jurisprudence
- Recognized Grotius as a highly erudite mind with a wide intellectual horizon
- Saw potential in Grotius's work for unifying philosophical, philological, and juridical concerns into a single system

**Vico's Unity of the Sciences Project (1719)**
- Announced in an inaugural speech, now lost
- Divided into three parts: knowing, wanting, and capacity to do as fundamental human faculties
- Aimed to reconcile theory and practice, philosophy and politics, consistent with Catholic religion

**Diritto universale (1720-1722)**
- Three volumes published in Italian
- Included an enhanced version of the inaugural speech and a manifesto summarizing key ideas
- First volume: De universi iuris uno principio et fine uno - expanded on first two parts of inaugural speech, treated principles of moral philosophy and essential concepts of philosophy of law
- Second volume: De constantia iurisprudentis - focused on history and philosophy of law, made headway in developing cultural theory but did not yet reach the scope of Scienza nuova

**Vico's Thought Development**
- Vico's epistemology in Liber metaphysicus not yet applied to humanities, but De universi iuris contains essential distinction between verum and certum
- Developed a genetic theory of institutions leading to forms of state
- Analyzed the history of Roman law to understand its development, showing law's historicity while accepting natural law tradition.


#### Vico's life and work: neglect of philology, Diritto universale, failed candidacy, New Science.

**Vico's Reflections on Philology and Philosophy (Diritto universale)**
- Vico raises the question: "Why do philosophers disregard the studies of philology? Are they right?" (II, 2, p. 318)
- Vico argues that Descartes's and Malebranche's philosophical disregard for philology is justifiable due to their preference for reason over memory. However, he considers the complete neglect of philology damning for Christian states as knowledge of classical languages like Hebrew, Greek, and Latin is indispensable for theology and jurisprudence.
- Vico suggests bringing philology under the principles of philosophy (p. 318) and making it a science by reducing it to those principles (p. 319).

**Vico's Works: Diritto universale and Notae**
- **Diritto universale**: Contains noteworthy insights into poetic theory, mythology, philosophy of language, and history. Vico was initially unsatisfied with it but later added a supplementary volume called "Notae" (1722).
- The Diritto universale marked a caesura in Vico's life: It was the last work his contemporaries could understand and praise.

**Vico's Failed Candidacy for a Chair at the University**
- In 1723, Vico had high hopes of being selected for a chair of civil law, which would increase his teaching salary sixfold. He believed his Diritto universale would help him achieve this goal.
- However, the committee was divided into factions favoring other candidates, and Vico withdrew his candidacy out of fear that his unwillingness to ingratiate himself with the members would be seen as arrogance.
- The failed candidacy was a significant blow for Vico, who had to abandon the hope of holding a worthier position in his native city.

**Vico's Transformation and Productivity After the Failed Candidacy**
- In a letter to his close friend Father Giacco (October 25, 1725), Vico recognized that negativity is an inevitable part of the laws of providence. He saw the failure as a source of productivity, channeling it into the creation of his masterpiece: "I would like only this to survive me."
- In the first SN (1723–1725), Vico had developed an extensive theory of human culture and civilization, redacted in a version called "in forma negativa" (now lost). He critiqued various competing theories of natural law and the archaic world, including those by Grotius, Selden, Pufendorf, Hobbes, Spinoza, Bayle, Locke, and possibly philologists like Voss and Bochart.


#### Vico's Scienza Nuova: Publishing struggles and personal reflections

**Vico's Unpublished Work: Scienza Nuova (New Science)**

**Background:**
- Vico entreated Cardinal Lorenzo Corsini for publication in 1724
- Agreement fell through due to financial reasons
- Vico self-funded the printing in 1725, reducing its size and structure

**Publication of Scienza Nuova Prima (First Edition):**
- Published as Principi di una scienza nuova intorno alla natura delle nazioni
- Discusses necessity and difficulty of human culture understanding
- Application of verum-factum principle to the humanities
- Separate books on principles of new science based on ideas and languages
- Lack of initial response from scholars, disappointment for Vico

**Attempted Second Edition in Venice:**
- Giovan Artico di Porcía asked Vico for intellectual autobiography
- Published as part of a project to persuade intellectuals to write their own autobiographies
- Encouraged study methods and potential reform of study methodology
- Discussions on SN in first and second parts
- Approached by Carlo Lodoli and Antonio Conti for publication in Venice in 1728
- New ideas motivating rewriting but poor manuscript reception led to relations breakdown

**Second Edition of Scienza Nuova (Second Edition):**
- Organic rewrite with notes integrated into text
- Published as Scienza nuova seconda in 1730
- Dedication to Corsini referencing providence and opportunities.


### Two Structure and Themes of the Scienza nuova: Formal and Methodological Aspects

**The Structure and Themes of Vico's Scienza Nuova**

**Formal and Methodological Aspects**:
- Vico composed the "Idea dell’opera" (Idea of the work) as an introduction to the second SN, but it lacks expository and didactic acumen.
- The author intends to discuss the essential arguments and intentions of the SN in a more systematic order: 
    1. Epistemological and ontological premises of Vico's cultural theory
    2. Central material propositions regarding the different spheres of human culture
    3. Vico's actual analyses of specific historical eras
- Vico's own structuring of the work, though inadequate as a systematic starting point today, is worth considering to understand his primitive logic.

**The Structure and Organization of the Scienza Nuova**:
- Vico opens the work with an allegorical frontispiece, which reflects baroque taste and the role of symbols in his reconstruction of archaic forms of thought.
- The first book, "Dello stabilimento de’ princìpi" (Establishing principles), expounds the historical-chronological and logical framework of the SN.
    1. "Annotazioni alla tavola cronologica" (Notes on the chronological table): Vico attempts to reduce historic dates into a systematic order, but this section is now obsolete.
    2. "Degli elementi" (Elements): Contains Vico's "degnità" (axioms), which outline his main ideas though lack consistent epistemological stance.
    3. "De’ princìpi" (Principles): Discusses anthropological constants as the basis of human institutions and first principles of the "new science".
    4. "Del metodo" (Method): Crucial for understanding Vico's concept of rational civil theology of divine providence and theory of philosophy and philology relationship.
- The second book, "Della sapienza poetica" (Poetic wisdom), is the richest, lengthiest, and most original in the SN. It reconstructs the worldview of the archaic period.
    1. Structured according to the framework of the tree of sciences, with two major branches: humanities and natural sciences.
    2. "Logica poetica" (Poetic logic): Understood as semiotic theory; Vico develops his philosophy of language within this framework.
    3. Poetic ethics, economics, politics: Concern the conduct of individuals, family, and state; Vico understands the word "family" in a broader sense to include slaves or servants.
    4. In poetic politics, Vico treats political institutions and underlying mentalities of the archaic world.


#### Giambattista Vico's Scienza Nuova: A philosophical exploration of history and culture, encompassing theology, philosophy, law, and more.

**The Natural Sciences Disciplines**
- Move from general to particular
- Vico's understanding of "physics" includes studies like physiology
- Chronology and geography are key for historiography
- Missing section on poetic disciplines, including art

**Book Three: Of the Discovery of the True Homer**
- Corollary to second book
- Elaborates categories used in archaic world reconstruction
- Interprets Homeric works using these categories
- Includes discussion of Greek dramatic and lyrical literature

**Book Four: The Course of Nations**
- Surveys different domains of culture corresponding to three ages
- Expresses principle of historical nature of human mind
- Includes digressions on political philosophy, history of law
- Systematic illustration of theory of historical development

**Book Five: The Resurgence of Nations and the Recurrence of Human Institutions**
- Compares archaic with medieval world
- Presents cyclical theory through comparison of epochs
- Long chapter comparing Roman law to feudal law of Middle Ages
- Conclusion synthesizes main themes, includes new idea on culture decadence.

**Vico's Writing Style**
- Repeats ideas frequently for emphasis
- Arbitrary connections between thoughts and names
- Mistakes in citations and interpretations
- Limited empirical information, but discoveries of great importance.

**Aims of Scienza Nuova (New Science)**
- Seven tasks:
  1. Rational civil theology of divine providence
  2. Philosophy of authority
  3. History of human ideas
  4. Critique of prehistory, reconstructing institutions on basis of religious representations
  5. Ideal eternal history
  6. System of natural law of nations
  7. Origins of universal history
- Includes diverse objectives relating to historical sciences and intellectual history.
- Philosophically and theologically grounded theory of human culture and civilization, focusing on systems of legitimation, particularly the law.


#### Vico's Science of Human Culture: Intersubjective Spirit and the World of Nations

**The Science of Culture (SN) According to Vico**

**Scope and Development of Culture:**
- SN concerned with historical development of culture: form, laws, intellectual & institutional history
- Knowledge of these laws sheds light on prehistory
- Misunderstood as philosophy of history by Jules Michelet
- Science of human culture encompassing ideas and institutions

**Vico's Assumptions:**
1. SN must be grounded in a nomothetic theory of human culture
2. Social sciences cannot be separated from the study of culture
3. Intersubjective spirit (world of nations) is essential for understanding humanity
4. Intersubjective spirit not explicitly recognized before Vico as intersubjectivity
5. Human spirit is social in nature, not solely focused on consciousness or inner self
6. Divine providence exists in both natural and political worlds
7. Science and philosophical theology are interconnected
8. Humanities deal with changes and immoral phenomena that appear chaotic at first glance but contain a divine order
9. Reflexive nature of humanities causes their late historical development yet excels within theory of science.

**Vico's Critique:**
- Rejection of methodological solipsism (separation from community)
- Criticism of Hellenistic philosophy as "monastic" and eschewing obligation to the community
10. Important ideas on history and philosophy of history within framework of nomothetic theory of human culture.


#### Vico's theory of verum-factum: Philology as a superior science due to human creations and knowledge.

**Vico's Claim of Superiority of Humanities Over Natural Sciences:**
- Vico argues for superiority of humanities based on greater claim to truth
- Introduces principle of verum-factum: inaccessible knowledge of nature, whereas principles of world of nations rooted in our mind (SN §331)
- Divine providence operates behind human actions and institutions, making history accessible to philosophers (not those who act)
- Identification of knowing and making in the philosopher of history (SN §349)
- Historical knowledge is reconstruction of past history, not forecasting future (p. 139f.)
- Common human structures in historical transformations ensure accessibility of archaic cultures to modern humans
- SN grounded in metaphysical world of Spirit for scientific character of the science of culture.

**Vico's Interpretation by Croce:**
- Importance of Croce's work in Vico scholarship undeniable (history, subject matter, depth)
- Misleading interpretations present within his work (not a trite claim against systematic philosophers).


#### Vico's philosophy: interconnectedness of history, philosophy, and philology, and the need for fundamental principles in historiography.

**Vico's Interpretation of Philosophy and Philology**

**Philosophers vs Historians**:
- Philosophers often provide more insight into past thinkers than simple historians
- Reason: They understand the "burning questions" and internal complexity of their predecessors
- However, philosophers can also impoverish the ideas of the philosophers they study by projecting their own positions and theses

**Croce's Critique of Vico**:
- Croce accused Vico of confusing philosophy, historiography, and social science based on his own idiographic notion of history
- This failed to grasp the "decisive and meaningful kernel" of Vico's theory that philosophy, social science, and historiography are inseparable
- Croce undervalued Vico's achievements in advancing historical-social scientific methodology

**Vico's Rebuke of Traditional Philology and Historiography**:
- Vico understood philosophy as the science of the true (universal laws) and philology as the science of the certain (authority, facticity)
- Philology encompassed languages, customs, and "facts" like deeds of war and peace
- Vico criticized traditional philology and historiography for unreasonably limiting themselves to written culture, which is a late development

**Reconciling Philosophy and Philology**:
- The different categories belong to philosophy (truth, intellect, science, reason) and philology (certainty, will, conscience, authority)
- This would be possible only if reality is determined by laws and reveals universal structures
- Archaic law, for example, lacks universality but may have its own "fantastic" logic and necessity of development

**Historiography as a Part of Philosophy**:
- Historiography without universal principles fails to perceive the most important manifestation of God in the world
- Historiography can only make sense of its objects if guided by philosophically grounded categories of the social sciences
- Social history is not distinct from sociology, but the study of the diachronic side of social institutions

**Vico's Achievement**:
- Vico analyzed a sphere of being that did not exist in Kant's system
- He was still far from understanding the differentiation of a priori and a posteriori elements of human knowledge


#### Vico's axioms: grounding, circularity, empirical vs rationalistic interpretations, necessary laws, historical development, foundational principles.

**Vico's Axioms: Interdependence and Origin**

**Interdependence of Axioms**:
- Vico claimed that individual axioms are interdependent
- One axiom implies the other, rather than being logically independent
- This suggests Vico did not fully understand the nature of a system of axioms

**Origin of Axioms**:
- Vico did not account for the origin of his axioms
- The distinction between axioms, postulates, and definitions indicates that Vico could not have ascribed the same level of validity to all propositions
- Vico's claim of having found necessary laws is inconsistent with merely hypothetical validity of some propositions

**Possible Reconstructions**:
1. **Empirical Approach**: Axioms are hypothetically prior, serving as a guide for analysis but being fallible and subject to change based on practical results.
2. **Rationalistic Approach**: Axioms have universal validity, determined by conceptual foundations that must be empirically interpreted.

**Vico's Claim of Necessary Laws**:
- Vico believed his notion of ideal eternal history constitutes an apodictic a priori, an absolute pattern of development
- Concrete validation through philology is necessary to understand real historical cultures and civilizations
- The distinction between the true and the certain, ideality and reality, belongs to the essence of the world governed by God.

**Limitations in Vico's Approach**:
- Lacks a foundation for ultimate principles, as in Hegel's Real philosophy
- Relies on common consensus as the criterion for normative questions
- A priori method of deduction to establish development lines is not developed.

**Conclusion**:
- Vico's assertion of having discovered necessary laws was not realized due to the lack of a developed a priori method in his philosophy.


#### Vico's argument for the scientificity of historical sciences through universal laws.

**Vico's Perspective on Historical Sciences**

**Distinction between Sciences of Events and Laws**:
- Windelband's distinction between idiographic (sciences of events) and nomothetic (sciences of laws) does not guarantee the autonomy of historical sciences and destroys their claim to scientific rigor.
- Historical sciences cannot be separated from systematic social sciences as they treat the historical evolution of human culture.
- They can claim scientificity only if they discover universal developmental laws.

**Universality in Historical Sciences**:
- Vico's notion of universality is different from Windelband's understanding.
- Vico sees universality as the constant repetition of a certain course of events, while Windelband understands it as a sort of being-pregnant-with-consequences.

**Discussion on Methodology**:
- This problem still constitutes one crucial point of the discussion on methodology of historical sciences and has been continually revised over the course of their histories.
- Vico's aim was to overcome the clear opposition between "science" and "history."

**Ideal Eternal History**:
- The central and decisive idea of Vico is that only the application of the concept of law to history can transform philology into a science.
- Ideal eternal history is an ideal, autonomous mode of existence, universal, and atemporal in respect to particular histories.
- It can be compared to Spinoza's categories of substance and modes.

**Cultural Development**:
- Vico claimed to have found universally valid laws of development.
- His knowledge was limited to Greek and Roman culture, with some indebtedness to other ancient cultures.
- He used travel narratives as a source for information about newly discovered peoples, especially those in the Americas.

**Differences between Peoples**:
- Vico acknowledged differences between peoples, but his interests focused more on similarities.
- Climate, mentality, and geographic location are factors that play a role in shaping different customs and languages.


#### Vico's theory of cultural development, ages, and providence: cycles, stages, and natural guidance.

**Vico's Theory of Cultural Development and Providence**

**Overview:**
- Greeks and Romans experienced rapid cultural development (3 SN §101, IV, 1; 3 SN §158-160, IV, 1)
- Not all cultures develop at the same pace or go through all stages (3 SN §1088, IV, 2; 3 SN §55, IV, 1; 3 SN §737, IV, 1)
- Vico's theory implies an order of succession in cultural development

**Limitations:**
1. Neglects possibility of slow or static cultures (India)
2. Undervalues phenomenon of cultural interference
3. Decadence seen as necessary outcome of development

**Critical Points:**
- Vico's belief in a necessary process of aging for cultures can be disputed
- Different interpretations of his theory: Catholic vs. Crocean (Hegelian)
- Providence functions naturally in history, except for Jews and Christians (3 SN §1047, IV, 2; 3 SN §313, IV, 1)
- Immanent providence permits system-theoretical reconstruction
- Transcendence and immanence are not mutually exclusive in Vico's theory.


#### Providence and Human Selfishness: Vico's Recapitulation of History and Progress.

**Providence and Human Progress according to Giambattista Vico**

**Background:**
- Providence shapes history through human intentions
- Expansion of selfishness into broader spheres
- Progress and decadence are part of providence's plan

**Vico on Progress:**
- Human beings pursue individual interests for the common good
- Universalist ideas come from institutions entangling particular interests
- Love of advantage above all else (3 SN §341, IV, 1, p. 125)
- Similarities with previous legitimations of capitalism (Mandeville's Fable of the Bees and Adam Smith's "invisible hand")
- Religious gratitude for transforming vices into virtues (3 SN §132f., IV, 1, p. 75f.)

**Vico on Decadence:**
- Providence uses decadence as a means of restoration (3 SN §1106, IV, 2, p. 162f.)
- Question if providence is equally responsible for progress and decadence
- Criticisms: limited response to theodicy, weaker arguments against determinism, lack of consideration for humanity's suicide or periodic decadence.

**Divine Determinations:**
- Omnipotence: roads of providence lead only toward order (3 SN §343, IV, 1, p. 126)
- Wisdom: simplest possible roads for providence (3 SN §343, IV, 1, p. 126)
- Goodness: greatest benefits granted to human race (3 SN §344f., IV, 1, p. 126f.; 3 SN §629ff., IV, 1, p. 300f.)

**Concerns with Vico's Argument:**
- Problem of theodicy: why wasn't another world created for direct access to reason without decadence? (requires assumption of an autonomous nature)
- Weak arguments against determinism (human liberty doesn't negate causality)
- Cyclical theory from ancients could imply conclusions about humanity's suicide or periodic decadence.

**First Act of Providence:**
- Faith in providence arises, constituting religion (3 SN §385, IV, 1, p. 152)
- Makes human beings rise above animal needs and reach state and culture.


#### Vico's beliefs on biblical history and Jewish people in chronology and sacredness

**Vico's Chronological System: Jews and Pagans**

**The Role of Biblical Narrative in Vico's Thought**:
- Vico maintains the autonomy of history with one exception: the history of the Hebrew people as narrated in the Old Testament
- This biblical narrative serves as the context for Vico's chronological beliefs, which were prevalent in 18th century Europe

**Shift in Perspective on Biblical Chronology**:
- Belief that world was created in earliest 6th millennium BCE predominated at beginning of 18th century
- Isaac Newton tried to prove the truth of biblical chronological dates
- Vico adhered to Jewish view, following Philo's dating of creation to 3761 BCE
- Vico considered events following creation story as true historical facts

**Jewish People and Pagans**:
- The sons of Noah initiated the chasm between secular (profane) and sacred history: the separation of peoples into pagans and Jews
- Only the Jews were able to preserve their humanity and proportionate physique, thanks to their religion
- Vico polemicizes against attempts to demonstrate Egyptian influences on the Jews, rejecting the idea that pagan myths are distorted biblical stories

**Consequences of Dividing Sacred and Secular History**:
- If Vico had applied critical approach from profane history to sacred history, he might have adopted historical-critical approach to Old Testament
- Vico read Spinoza's Tractatus, which analyzed the Old Testament, but shunned its findings on the composition of the Pentateuch


#### Vico's historical analysis: Archaic vs modern human nature and historiography errors

**Vico's Comparison between Moses and Homer**
- In the first Synopsis of the Principles of History (SN), Vico compared Moses's mode of expression to Homer's, but found it more sublime (1 SN §28, III, p. 22; 1 SN §192, III, p. 115; 1 SN §293, III, p. 168)
- In the second chapter of the third book of SN, Vico claimed that "poetry constituted the first common language of all the ancient nations, including even that of the Hebrews" (1 SN §253, III, p. 147)
- In the second SN, comparisons between Moses and Homer are less frequent, possibly due to Vico's theory that the Homeric works were formed over centuries

**Vico's Belief in Biblical Chronology**
- Vico clings to biblical chronology, rejecting all datings in contradiction with the biblical date of creation (3 SN §45, IV, 1, p. 38; 3 SN §50, IV, 1, p. 41; 3 SN §99, IV, 1, p. 63)
- He polemicized against the "conceit of nations" and their claims to greater antiquity than they had in reality (3 SN §83, IV, 1, p. 56)
- Modern historical research has verified Vico's principles of archaic mentality more than biblical chronology

**Vico's Theory on Historical Development: Norm and History**
- Vico believed that pagan nations only attain full rationality in a late age of development, while the Jews developed with rational thinking from the beginning (3 SN §120ff., IV, 1, p. 73ff.)
- He identified two "conceits" (borias): the conceit of nations, which imagines every ancient people as the most ancient and favored; and the conceit of scholars, which projects modern ideas into the past (3 SN §120ff., IV, 1, p. 73ff.)
- Vico struggled to "descend" from civilized spirit to the archaic mentality, successfully doing so by behaving as if there were no books in the world (3 SN §330, IV, 1, p. 117; 3 SN §338, IV, 1, p. 123f.)
- Vico's interpretation of Achilles is an example of his historical analysis: he realized that Achilles' values were distant from modern ones and yet Homer did not portray him as wicked, suggesting our values are a product of later historical development (3 SN §666f., IV, 1, p. 321f.; cf. 3 SN §786, IV, 2, p. 6)


#### Vico's theory on human history: Gods, heroes, and men; rational thought development.

**Vico's Interpretation of Human History: The Three Ages**

**1. Vico's Analysis of Love and Emotions in Mythology:**
- Achilles does not experience love for Briseis (Iliad)
- No references to love pains regarding Achilles or Menelaus towards Helen
- Importance of women lies in social prestige, possession, and motherhood of children
- Lack of "gallant eroticism" in heroic age

**2. The Development of Self-Consciousness:**
- Awareness of unity of self-consciousness not present in archaic man
- Ancient man conceives himself as a changeable plurality without unitary center
- Missing term for designating the mind in Homer's work

**3. Historical Change and Rational Thought:**
- People first feel things without noticing them
- Notice with inner distress and disturbance
- Reflect on them with clear mind
- Prelogical thought present in primitive man
- Divided into three ages: gods, heroes, men

**4. The Three Ages of Human History:**
- Age of the Gods (mythical age): lasts 900 years
  * Theocratic age with enlarged family and father as diviner, priest, and king
  * Institution of twelve principal divinities
  * Discovery and utilization of sea
- Age of Heroes (dark age): lasts 200 years
  * Class warfare between patricians and plebeians
  * Formation of personality and individuality
  * Poetic characters focus on heroes, not gods
  * Aggressive subjectivity based on social position
- Age of Men (historical age): ongoing
  * Democracy and absolute monarchy with equal civil and political rights
  * Reason and conscience as ultimate grounds for authority
  * Law is soft and gives way to equity
  * Understanding of own existence's dignity without projecting it onto gods or heroes

**5. Dialectical Articulation of the Three Ages:**
- First age: irreflexive equality
- Second age: conflict and discord
- Third age: regaining equality at the level of conscious rationality

**6. Survival of Atavisms:**
- Poetic speech continues to run its course into historical period
- Age of the gods continues in customs and institutions.


#### Giambattista Vico's theory on history, culture, and rationalization evolution.

**Cultural and Social Change**

**Gradual and Slow Process**:
- Cultural change happens gradually and slowly
- Cultures maintain traditions of institutions that owe their existence
- Human beings maintain characteristics of previous mentality after transitioning to a later age

**Asynchronous Development in Cultures**:
- Even developed cultures have customs from earlier stages
- Examples: Belief in magic and use of computers, feudal mentality and democratic state, etc.

**Continuity Between Ages**:
- Three languages correspond to three epochs, not diachronically but synchronically related to social carriers
- Evolutionary theory of mind: Different mental faculties existed, center of gravity transferred in evolution

**Rationalization and Disenchantment**:
- Reason unfolds as a process of development
- Teleological belief: History is a process of unfolding reason implicitly guiding from the beginning
- Rationalistic systems embrace understanding irrational factors, not destruction of value rationality

**Vico's View on Western Cultures vs. Universal Development**:
- Greek philosophy culminates in Plato and Aristotle
- Modern philosophy should also culminate in rationalistic systems
- Vico would view modern process of destruction of reason as a sign of decadence

**Abandonment of Rational Concept of God**:
- Teleology reduced to development governed by blind fate without affirmative character
- Vico's teleological characterization: Age of Men = Fully Developed Reason
- Temporality interrupted in the age of men, as divine reason becomes partially accessible

**Reason Within Time and History vs. Atemporal Telos**:
- Reason is historical but its telos is to approach atemporal absolute reason
- Reason is within time, but its end goal is to constitute time and history


#### Vico's perspective on history: empathy, progress, and cultural connections

**Vico's Thought on Reason, Teleology, and the Age of Men**

**Vico's Perspective**:
- Believes reason is the condition for his work
- Knows it would be fatal to relativize his own activity "for historical reasons"
- Teleological character in his work does not exclude immanent reconstruction of causal sort, but demands it
- Recognizes historical necessity of prerational eras
- Understands archaic world's mind deeply and empathizes with its suffering
- Judges these standards against ideal justice and finds them wanting

**Vico's Approach**:
- Interprets law, custom, art based on spirit of time they belong to
- Argues for necessity of human sacrifices, horrible punishments, etc.
- Theoretical attitude leads him to empathy for all the suffering and oppressed

**Vico's Teleological View**:
- Formation of rationality marks loss of archaic world's emotional intensity and fantasy
- Progress in political-juridical sphere connected to aesthetic regression
- Occasional nostalgia for archaic world, but critique prevails unequivocally

**Vico's View on Unity of Culture**:
- Believes different cultural phenomena are manifestations of one mentality in a people
- Compares his work to Cuvier's paleontology: ability to reconstruct entire culture from details
- Recognizes not all details are meaningful or indicative for an epoch
- Assumes cultures become increasingly capable of freeing themselves from dependence on other spheres


#### Exploring the foundations of culture through forms of perception and cognition in Vico's perspective

**Vico's Theory of Culture: The Origin of Archaic Religion and Poetry**

**Archaic Human Perception**:
- Man of the first epoch cannot think logically or abstractly
- Cannot form universal concepts, only understands particulars
- Thinks in poetic characters (e.g., archaic humans could not conceive the general concept of courage)

**Myths and Reality**:
- Myths are symbolic forms through which reality becomes accessible to archaic humans
- Vico disputes the thesis that archaic religion originates in fraud
- Archaic humans truly believed they saw gods on earth

**Archaic Poetry**:
- Poetic nature of primitive man, different from philosophy
- Explained by the particularistic mode of thinking and feeling of that age
- Concrete characteristics of archaic poetry (heroic sentences, historical character) derived from this mode of thought

**Limitations of Archaic Cosmos**:
- Intellectual abilities condition religious and moral beliefs
- Lack of ethical universalism tied to inability to form universal concepts
- Early humans' understanding of number and the infinite

**Expansion of the Mind**:
- The more the mind understands itself, the greater the world it believes it lives in
- Intellectual abilities condition religious and moral beliefs

**Religious Ideas and Political Structures**:
- Vico uses Homer's religious ideas as a key to understanding archaic Greek society
- The position of Zeus reflects the meager power of the aristocratic king
- Connection between customs, accepted values, and political institutions

**Objective or Absolute Spirit**:
- Question about which should be considered prior not explicitly discussed by Vico
- Transfer of problem to the plane of intersubjective spirit


#### Vico's method for understanding different cultures: Bridging objective and subjective approaches with ideal eternal history and pure reason.

**The Problem of Knowledge of Different Cultures: Vico's Method**

**Understanding Ancient and Different Cultures**:
- The problem lies in accessing the "inner worlds" of other cultures, which are not directly accessible
- Approaching these inner worlds requires overcoming the modern abstraction of the isolated subject
- Language is the bridge that connects the body and mind, providing an intersubjective dimension

**Vico's Contributions**:
- Vico proposed a solution to this problem based on the principle of verum-factum
- Understanding a culture cannot be reduced to understanding the intentions of its members
- The mode of providence's action in history requires analyzing structures that characterize social systems independently from conscious action

**Approaches to Understanding Cultures**:
- **Objective approach**: Analyzing observable behavior according to laws
- **Subjective approach**: Empathically penetrating the inner world of acting subjects
- Vico's position is more favorable than Descartes in resolving the issue of accessing other subjectivities

**Limitations of Empathy Approach**:
- Vico's theory of archaic mentality emphasizes fantasy as a crucial moment, which requires abandoning memory and fantasy
- Understanding archaic man is not about reexperiencing emotions but about using metaphysical vision rooted in an a priori foundation (ideal eternal history)

**Conclusion**:
- Vico's method focuses on the development of human history from perception, passion to reason, and uniting this knowledge with the introspection of our own human nature to achieve effective understanding.


#### Vico's "Scienza Nuova": Comparing Cultures and Understanding Human Development

**Vico's Ideas: Parallel Development of Ontogenesis and Phylogenesis**

**Correspondence between Onto- and Phylogenesis:**
- Vico assumes principles of individual development parallel those of cultures
- Infantile development mirrors archaic culture
- Old concept, grounded in Vico's ideal eternal history

**Interest in Infantile Development:**
- Comparison to Piaget's studies
- Understanding the "infantile world" of first men

**Observations on Children:**
- Inability to think universal concepts
- Power of memory and fantasy
- Capacities for imitation

**Phylogenetic Development of Language:**
- Referenced in relation to children's speech and neurological disturbances
- Comparison between Roman clientage and feudal relationships

**Comparative Method:**
- Valuable for articulating a nomothetic theory of culture
- Exposes universal structures across cultures
- Applied to religions, legal systems, languages, symbols, and customs

**Uniformity of Ideas:**
- Found in various peoples and their corresponding deities (e.g., Jupiter)
- Common mental language among nations, expressed differently
- Surprising similarities point to objective structure

**Explanation for Correspondences:**
- Genetic explanation: common origin or borrowing
- Vico's explanation: common human nature and development


### Three Structure and Themes of the Scienza nuova: Material Aspects

**Vico's Interpretation of Primitive Humans**

**Primitives Humans vs. Beasts**:
- Vico compared primitive humans to beasts, unlike orthodox Catholic thinkers
- Early attempts to connect Vico's ideas to Darwin
- Vico saw primitive humans as "stupid, insensate, and horrid beasts" who found themselves in a "bestial and brutish state" after the universal flood

**Human Evolution and the Bestioni**:
- The humanization of the "bestioni" (wild beasts) began with the appearance of bolts piercing the sky
- This instilled terror in primitive men, leading them to lift their gaze to the sky and interpret it as a divine being
- Fear of an indeterminate divinity moderated wild passions and taught humans to control their impulses

**Marriage, Shame, and Religion**:
- Vico located the two links that bind society in **sense of shame** and **religion**
- He saw the three basic anthropological traits that distinguish humans from animals in religion, marriage, and funeral rites

**Empirical Foundation**:
- Vico's foundation is empirical, not deduced from the idea of a finite spiritual being
- He defended the theory that those three characteristics are found in all peoples, polemicizing against those who argued otherwise

**Marriage and Monogamy**:
- Vico did not take monogamous marriage as an anthropological constant, but rather referred to nuptial rites that precede coitus
- The prohibition against incest originated not in nature, but in human nature

**Funeral Rituals and Immortality**:
- Funeral rituals originate from the faith in immortality of the human soul
- Tombs were the religious places par excellence

**Vico's Nonprejudicial Analysis**:
- Vico's nonprejudicial analysis of the deep relationships between sexuality and culture is surprising, reminiscent of Freud
- He saw society as paralyzed if it allowed for the gratification of every sexual inclination
- Marriage and family were the basis of human society and the state

**Dissolution of Marriage**:
- Vico considered the dissolution of marriage as a great danger, unlike the romantic idealization of marriage in modern times
- The most ancient family was strictly patriarchal, with the paterfamilias as diviner, priest, and king


#### Anthropological exploration of ancient religions and their violent practices.

**Archaic Religion and Society**

**Origins of Archaic Religion:**
- Based on animistic disposition of primitive humans (3 SN §186f., IV, 1, p. 87; 3 SN §375, IV, 1, p. 145f.)
- Primitive humans attributed divinity to phenomena they didn't understand (3 SN §69, IV, 1, p. 50; 3 SN §630, IV, 1, p. 301; 3 SN §922, IV, 2, p. 55)
- Gods assumed human nature (3 SN §967, IV, 2, p. 82)
- Fear and savagery were complementary in archaic society (3 SN §190, IV, 1, p. 87)

**Divination:**
- Attempt to understand language of gods (3 SN §365, IV, 1, p. 137f.; 3 SN §379ff., IV, 1, p. 148ff.; 3 SN §525, IV, 1, p. 232f.)
- Oracles and auspices were first wisdom (3 SN §365, IV, 1, p. 137f.)
- Magic arose from divination (3 SN §475, IV, 1, p. 203; 3 SN §648, IV, 1, p. 312)

**Sacrifices:**
- Human sacrifices were common in archaic societies (3 SN §191, IV, 1, p. 88; 3 SN §517f., IV, 1, p. 225ff.; 3 SN §550, IV, 1, p. 247ff.; 3 SN §776, IV, 1, p. 378)
- Functionalist analysis: divine providence allowed cruel religions to teach respect for institutions (3 SN §177f., IV, 1, p. 85; 3 SN §518, IV, 1, p. 227; 3 SN §523, IV, 1, p. 231)

**Institutions and Society:**
- Indispensable for archaic humans' real survival and self-understanding (3 SN §948, IV, 2, p. 67)
- Vico criticized contractualism: division of property not based on rational conventions (3 SN §550, IV, 1, p. 247f.)
- Archaic man lives in institutions; his life is nourished by them (implicitly distinguishes latent and manifest function)


#### Vico's thoughts on archaic institutions, myths, and poetic wisdom

**Vico's Perspective on Archaic Institutions and Myths**

**Institutions as "Ordini" (Orders)**
- Express eternal ordering principles
- Divine providence uses them for maintaining social systems
- Maintained by collective memory composed of symbols

**Collective Memory and Social Identity**
- Principle of identity for social systems: Mnemosyne
- Importance of rituals involving water and fire
- Significance of sacred ablutions in archaic religion

**Myth and Poetic Wisdom**
- Logic of primitive man
- Vico's discovery of poetic characters as master key to understanding myths

**Origins of Poetic Characters**
- Inability to form abstract concepts among ancient peoples
- Identification of qualities with things they go together with
- Mythical figures are univocal, not analogous, meanings

**Impact on Philosophy and Interpretation of Ancient Works**
- Rejection of allegorical interpretations of myths and hieroglyphs
- Forgeries attributing philosophical thoughts to ancient sages
- Scorn for the idea of a succession of philosopher schools through various peoples.


#### Giambattista Vico's interpretation of mythology and its historical significance.

**Vico's View on Mythology:**
- Vico distinguishes between common (poetic) and esoteric wisdom
- Common wisdom: "sapienza volgare" - knowledge of first legislators who founded nations with religions
- Esoteric wisdom: "sapienza riposta" - knowledge of philosophers
- Both types deal with theoretical and practical, divine and human matters
- Relationship between them is like that between senses and intellect
- Mistaken interpretation of poetic wisdom as philosophical due to reverence for religion, belief in supernatural guidance of political world, use of myths by philosophers, human need for authority

**Mythology and History:**
- Myths contain historical kernel despite their immanent logic not necessarily corresponding with reality
- Myths reflect ancient experiences: political conflicts, birth of new institutions, religious wars
- Historical origins of history through mythology

**Vico's Interpretation of Myths:**
- Political-social type: focus on conflicts between plebeians and patricians
- Rejection of sexual interpretation as the primary meaning
- Original meaning of phrases has a political nature, metaphysical reinterpretations are arbitrary and erroneous

**Natural Theogony:**
- Vico surmises that individual deities were invented on occasion of introducing certain useful or necessary institutions.


#### Vico's philosophy on gods, language, and ancient history. Reconstructing theology and culture through social institutions and etymology. Primitive thought and archaic language. Expressive function of language. Etymological methods for understanding ancient ideas. Ancient language as a fantastic speech based on animate substances. Tropes arising from sensuous language. Anthropomorphism in archaic expressions.

**Vico's Philosophy of Language**
- Vico showed interest in language's expressive and conative functions, not just its referential function (Coseriu 1972, p. 91)
- Language is autonomous and rooted in human culture (3 SN §379ff., IV, 1, p. 148ff.)
- In the archaic age, there were no texts, so Vico focused on social institutions and language to reconstruct ancient history (3 SN §33, IV, 1, p. 28)
- Language expresses a manner of thought; ideas and languages developed inseparably (3 SN §234, IV, 1, p. 95; 3 SN §354, IV, 1, p. 130)
- Etymology helps infer the ideas of archaic people about things (3 SN §354, IV, 1, p. 130)
- Vico's etymologies are often erroneous due to the lack of comparative linguistics at his time
- Vico discovered ancient language was "a fantastic speech based on animate substances" (3 SN §401, IV, 1, p. 162)
- Ancient humans expressed concepts using divinities and personifications instead of abstract ideas (3 SN §460, IV, 1, p. 195f.; 3 SN §935, IV, 2, p. 61f.)
- Tropes like metaphor, metonymy, and synecdoche arose from a sensuous language that could not form abstract concepts (3 SN §409, IV, 1, p. 167)

**Vico's Gods and the Archaic Age**
- Vico ordered the twelve gods in the following manner: Jupiter, Juno, Diana, Apollo, Vulcan, Saturn, Vesta, Mars, Venus, Minerva, Mercury, Neptune (3 SN §317, IV, 1, p. 114)
- Each god represented specific aspects of the archaic age: settlement, matrimony, water cult, political glory, clearing forest and agriculture, warrior mentality, political beauty, birth of cities, presentation of agrarian law, sea navigation (3 SN §280ff., IV, 1, p. 125ff.)
- Vico aimed to reconstruct the history of institutions in the archaic age using these divine symbols (3 SN §364ff., IV, 1, p. 137)


#### Giambattista Vico's theory on the development of language and writing in ancient cultures

**Vico's Theorem on Language Development:**
- "Homo non intelligendo fit omnia" (Man becomes all things by not using his intellect)
- Archaic language composed of metaphors or tiny myths
- Primitive humans communicated through song and verses
- Laws written in verses
- Three ages of language: age of gods, heroic/symbolic language, vernacular language

**Language Development:**
- No supernatural origin
- Gradual evolution
- Three languages corresponding to three ages
- Onomatopoeic words first
- Monosyllabic interjections and particles
- Nouns and verbs development was most difficult due to temporal connection
- Primacy of oral tradition in archaic cultures
- Spoken language development parallels written language development
- Hieroglyphic writing: primitive, limited to aristocracy, favors democracy (vs. alphabetic writing)

**Language Development Timeline:**
- First language: rational language of Adam (prelapsarian)
- Confusion of languages after Babel incident
- Heroic/symbolic language: monosyllabic imperatives, metaphors, images, comparisons
- Vernacular language: modern, abstract, more furnished with general concepts
- Spoken and written language development occur simultaneously

**Language Development Effects:**
- Social status inheres in language
- Superior linguistic competence ascribed to inferior social stratum
- Archaic humans had exceptional memory power
- Primitive writing: concrete things, crude, limited to aristocracy.


#### Vico's aesthetic ideas: poetry as metaphysical truth and connection to the people

**Vico's Aesthetics:**

**Background**
- No specific section dedicated to aesthetics in SN
- Exceptional development of aesthetic thought
- Two types of aesthetic theories: one at the service of art, the other sees reflection as toxic

**Historicity of Art**
- Vico's contribution in this context is significant
- Pre-Kantian philosophy, lacks transcendental deduction but has normativity

**Poetry and Truth**
- Poetic truth: metaphysical, not physical
- Absence of external reality agreement
- Poets should represent the "credible impossible"
- Study of geometry recommended for poets to create logically consistent falsities

**Criteria for Great Poetry**
- Internal coherency and comprehensive unity are decisive
- Essence of beauty lies in correct relationship of parts with the whole.

**Poetry vs Philosophy**
- Poetry has a natural-sensible dimension, addresses people through concrete examples
- Philosophy treats matters in a generic way, only for intellectuals.


#### Vico's perspective on poetry, its tasks, and the relationship between poetry and philosophy.

**Vico's Views on Poetry and Rhetoric**

**Poetry vs. Rhetoric**:
- Poetry is connected with moral and social functions
- Poets induce persuasion by giving plastic portrayals of exalted actions and characters
- Poetry demands unity of universal concepts and fantasy ("universali fantastici")
- Poetic language and worldview are inherently poetic in primitive age

**Poetry vs. Philosophy**:
- Poetry and philosophy are mutually exclusive
- Each presupposes a different forma mentis: poetry is steeped in the world of perception, metaphysics must abstract from the sensible
- It is impossible to be both a great poet and philosopher

**Poetic Theologians and Founders of Archaic States**:
- Poetic theologians laid foundations of civilization through successful performance of tasks: inventing sublime myths, exciting ecstasy, teaching virtuous action

**Vico's Analysis of Tropes**:
- Vico is aware of difference between poetry and rhetoric
- Task of addressing imagination and emotions while communicating universal metaphysical truths demands unity of concepts and fantasy

**Poetic vs. Philosophical Maxims**:
- Poetic maxims are based on particularisms, philosophical maxims claim origins in reflection and intellect
- Principle of philosophical language is opposed to that of poetry

**Homer as Greatest Poet**:
- Homer's similes, epic descriptions, and inelegancies contribute to his greatness
- Vico prefers the energetic barbarity of Homer and Dante to refined late poetry

**Need for New Poetics**:
- Vico departs from theories of Plato, Aristotle, Patrizi, Scaliger, and Castelvetro
- The sublime fantasy of Homer distinguishes his art from others

**Evaluating Poets of Different Ages**:
- Vico maintains position against aesthetic relativism: not every epoch has equally great poets
- Homer is the greatest poet based on criteria taken from the concept of art

**Equivocation of Myth and Poetry**:
- Identification of aesthetic beauty with form of expression of archaic world risks making theory tautological
- Investigating mediation between rational and sensible within modern conditions is necessary

**Plato's Synthesis of Philosophy and Poetry**:
- Vico neglects the fact that Plato accomplished significant synthesis of both poetry and philosophy.


#### Giambattista Vico's theory on social classes, heroes, and class warfare in history.

**Vico's Theory of Class Warfare and Heroes**

**Background:**
- Vico's esteem in Marxist philosophy due to theory of history as a foreshadowing of class warfare
- Describes contrast between social groups as source of social change
- Focus on Roman history, extending theory to archaic history and application to other peoples
- Two social classes: patricians (heroes) and plebeians
- Oversimplification of only two classes is a flaw in his theory

**Vico's Interest in Social Conflicts:**
- Nomothetic conception of history
- Underappreciated importance of geniuses over history
- Connection between certain types of extraordinary political leaders and historical conditions
- Heroes: Glittering appearance, fame only among common people
- Formation of different social classes

**Patricians vs. Plebeians:**
- Originated from Roman relationship of clientage and medieval feudal law
- Maltreatment of plebeians due to contempt, considered subhuman or divine origin
- Lack of access to auspices, quasihumanistic behavior
- Acceptance of contempt crucial for social change

**Plebeian Uprisings:**
- Inspired by observation that sons of heroes become free after fathers' death
- Formation of first political institutions due to revolt and common political will
- Limited power of new order led by a king, partial accommodation of plebs

**Property Ownership:**
- Bonitary ownership: Roman civil law term for ownership according to praetorian law
- Contrasted with quiritary ownership reserved for Roman citizens.


#### Analysis of ancient political systems: conflict between patricians and plebeians, property ownership, and social structure.

**Vico's Reconstruction of Ancient Roman Property Ownership**

**Bonitary (Natural) Ownership**:
- Revocable, not hereditary
- Similar to usufruct
- Only applicable to plebeians
- Could not pass property through inheritance or testament

**Quiritary Ownership**:
- Full ownership of property
- Originally reserved for patricians

**Civil Ownership/Eminent Domain**:
- Public property

**Political System**:
- Extremely harsh
- Based on strict closure of the patrician class
- Patricians made laws in secret deliberation
- Plebeians deprived of citizenship, considered foreigners/enemies
- Any patricians aiding plebeians labeled traitors and executed

**State of Civil War**:
- Latent state between the two orders (plebeians and patricians)
- Vico recalls C. Schmitt's "The Concept of the Political"
- Permanent state of undeclared war between city-states

**Colonies**:
- Inland colonies: settlements of servants for masters
- Overseas colonies: founded by fugitive plebeians

**Asylums**:
- Ancient cities founded by those fleeing asylums
- War between patricians and plebeians continued for centuries

**Debt Bondage**:
- Patricians had additional means of oppression through debt bondage

**Plebeian Progression**:
- Identified with their progresses, participated in their sufferings
- Plebeians are the progressive element, patricians exemplify conservatism and stasis
- Plebeians more intelligent due to need for cunning

**Social Transformation**:
- Solon brought democracy to Athens, destroyed belief in divine origin of patricians, taught general equality of human intellect
- Money as a mechanism of social transformation
- Aristocratic republics less inclined to imperialistic wars than democratic states

**Centrifugal Tendencies**:
- When plebeian class lusts for money, civil wars inevitable, leading to monarchy.


#### Vico's perspective on heroism, politics, and the historical evolution of law

**Vico's View on Equality and Heroism:**
- Political and civil equality is legitimate end
- Domination must be just
- Defines politics as "la scienza di comandare e d'ubbidire nelle cittá" (the science of commanding and obeying in states)
- Heroism is a forma mentis, but it fails to consider social empathy
- Criticizes heroes for their arrogance, greed, and cruelty
- Transforms Augustinian view into social critique: what did ancient Romans do for the poor plebs?
- Heroic qualities like resoluteness and overcoming base interests can be admired
- Philosophical heroism is virtuous, ancient variety is a mix of great virtues and vices
- Ambivalence towards Achilles: awed by his grandeur but acknowledges barbarity

**Vico's Interest in Law:**
- Greater interest in law than any other aspect of human culture
- Detailed study of Roman, medieval feudal, and early modern legal history
- Attacks proponents of natural law theory for failing to consider historicity of law
- Condemns Grotius, Selden, and Pufendorf for conflating three forms of natural law
- Interest in history of law, especially primitive legal institutions
- Focuses on laws of development of the history of law rather than individual cases.


#### Giambattista Vico's view on law development: from customary to rational

**Vico's Conception of Law:**
* Vico does not have a relativistic view of law (3 SN §326, IV, 1, p. 116; cf. 3 SN §633, IV, 1, p. 303)
* Enlightenment natural law is the normative telos of historical law development
* Modern natural law derived from "fully developed human reason" (3 SN §326, IV, 1, p. 116; cf. 3 SN §633, IV, 1, p. 303)
* Transition from customary to codified law: Sparta had fewer laws obeyed than Athens, Roman law characterized by multiplication of laws (3 SN §1000f., IV, 2, p. 102f.)
* Law and forms of state have similarities
* Importance of ceremonies and legal symbols in archaic law due to form of communication in the first age (3 SN §922, IV, 2, p. 55; 3 SN §938, IV, 2, p. 63)

**Archaic Law vs. Modern Law:**
* "Certo" (certain) and "vero" (true) laws (3 SN §321ff., IV, 1, p. 115f.; 3 SN §1045, IV, 2, p. 127)
* Archaic law's validity from positive authority, modern law legitimated by natural reason
* Archaic law not merely compulsion but derived from peoples’ customs (3 SN §308f., IV, 1, p. 111f.; 3 SN §525, IV, 1, p. 232)

**Transition from Customary Law to Codified Law:**
* Lack of recourse to courts, vigilante justice and feuds common (3 SN §269, IV, 1, p. 102)
* Actions quod metus causa and vi bonorum raptorem, interdict unde vi late developments (3 SN §638, IV, 1, p. 307f.)

**Early Law:**
* First laws formulated ad hoc for specific cases after they have taken place (3 SN §500, IV, 1, p. 214f.)
* Determination of punishment based on lex talionis: distributive justice arises after commutative justice (3 SN §1042, IV, 2, p. 125f.)
* Violence in heroic age checked by religion and absolute deference to literal meaning of contractual formulae (3 SN §923, IV, 2, p. 55; 3 SN §965f., IV, 2, p. 81f.)

**Symbolism and Formulae in Early Law:**
* Symbols define the law of the age of gods, formulae characterize heroic law (3 SN §939, IV, 2, p. 63f.)
* Violence can only be checked by religion and absolute deference to literal meaning of contractual formulae (3 SN §923, IV, 2, p. 55; 3 SN §965f., IV, 2, p. 81f.)
* Uti lingua nuncupassit, ita ius esto: declaration, not will, is important (3 SN §570, IV, 1, p. 263; 3 SN §968, IV, 2, p. 83)


#### The development of Roman law: Formalism, equity, and universal legal equality.

**Archaic Roman Law: Formalism and Equity**

**Importance of Fictions in Archaic Law:**
- Protect against abusive interpretation (3 SN §939, IV, 2, p. 63f.)
- Maintain respect for law while making adjustments (Vico: un serio poema)
- Beginning of dissolution with use of fictions (Crassus vs. Q. Mucius Scaevola, De oratore I, 180)
- Final step: elimination of formulary procedure (mistakenly attributed to Constantine)

**Consensual Contracts:**
- Late development in archaic age
- Bona fides unknown
- Economic reasons for their emergence
- Important achievement in Roman law

**Trend toward Equity:**
- Gradual responsiveness to individual cases
- Imperial law consists of privileges and exceptions (3 SN §1001, IV, 2, p. 103f.)
- Praetorian law mediates between ancient and imperial law

**Basic Principle of Human Law:**
- Universal legal equality
- Arbitration of equally legitimate interests

**Development of Roman Law:**
- Trend toward universalism
- Greater respect for individual liberty
  - Family and inheritance law: father's control weakened, emancipations, legitimizations
  - Improved status of children: abolition of archaic rights, limited capacity to manage funds, positive view on emancipations
  - Adoptions: fewer exceptions
  - Slaves: limits on maltreatment, manumission made easier
- Universalizing tendencies in international relationships (Constitutio Antoniniana)

**Vico's Position:**
- Clear favoring of imperial-age law
- Progress in overcoming formalism but aware of deteriorations (decadence)

**Problems with Vico's Doctrine:**
1. Perception of late antiquity: positive or negative view on the elimination of formulary procedure and its substitution with cognitio procedure?
2. Cyclical structure of De universi iuris: realization of law at end of historical development or a lost cyclical structure?


#### Vico's theory of political development: Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy

**Vico's Political Thought: Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy**

**Two Types of Monarchy:**
- Ancient family monarchy: originates at the beginning of historical development, no legal equality
- Modern monarchy: end of historical development, based on universal legal equality

**Forms of State in the Age of Men:**
- Aristocracies: middle term between monarchy and democracy
- Democratic republics

**Connection Between Beginning and End:**
- Political development determined by numeric relationships
- Progress from one form to another does not result in mixing but coexistence

**Monarchy and Democracy:**
- Internal affinity between them, opposed to aristocracies
- Monarchies more favorable to legal equality than aristocracies

**Roman History as Example:**
- Abolition of early monarchy did not introduce democracy
- King is a primus inter pares in aristocratic republics

**Power Dynamics:**
- Real power lies with nobles in some modern monarchies
- Plebeians' demographic growth led to democracies due to majority rule

**Spiritual Circumstances Favoring Democracy:**
- Religion: plebeians believed they had same rights as patricians
- Science: more democracies in Europe than other continents

**Causal Mechanisms Operating in Opposite Directions:**
- Socrates developed induction analyzing consensus formation in Athenian democracy
- Alphabetic writing favored democracy by making laws universally accessible

**End of Aristocratic Republics:**
- Inevitably approaching their end, unless impeded by extraordinary causes
- Over time, monarchies governed aristocratically become perfect (absolute) monarchies.


#### Vico's analysis of forms of government and cultural decay: aristocracies, democracies, monarchies, and decline.

**Authentic Aristocracies**
- Small city-states: Nuremberg, Ragusa, Venice, Genoa, Lucca (3 SN §29, IV, 1, p. 25; 3 SN §1018, IV, 2, p. 113; 3 SN §1094, IV, 2, p. 152)
- Limited territories (3 SN §1024, IV, 2, p. 117)
- Can survive only through nobles compromising with populace
- Once overturned, reversion to aristocracy is nearly impossible (3 SN §1087, IV, 2, p. 149)
- Survived due to nobles' compromise with the populace

**Relationship Between Democracy and Monarchy**
- Vico's position more complex than apparent
- Monarchy considered best suited to human nature (3 SN §1008, IV, 2, p. 109)
- Follows democracy but also seen as an evil (3 SN §29, IV, 1, p. 25; 3 SN §1087, IV, 2, p. 149)
- Evolution from republic to principate inevitable but a necessary evil (3 SN §1087, IV, 2, p. 149)

**Democracy and Monarchy**
- Democracy: Wealth determines elite membership (3 SN §1101, IV, 2, p. 160f.)
- Frustrations of the poor exploited by ambitious leaders (3 SN §292, IV, 1, p. 107)
- Tendency to anarchy worse than every tyranny (3 SN §292, IV, 1, p. 107)
- Monarchs strive for legal parity and equalize nobility with commons (3 SN §995, IV, 2, p. 99; 3 SN §1008, IV, 2, p. 108f.)
- De politicization of commoners and nobles in monarchy (3 SN §290ff., IV, 1, p. 107f.)
- Private interests dominate over public good (3 SN §290ff., IV, 1, p. 107f.)
- Tradition of reason of state atrophies (3 SN §290ff., IV, 1, p. 107f.)

**Universal State and the Age of Men**
- Belief in universal tendencies toward a universal state (see p. 126)
- Monarchies aim to make whole world into a single city (3 SN §1092f., IV, 2, p. 152)
- Ultimate form of states: confederation (3 SN §1092f., IV, 2, p. 152)
- Sovereign heads enter into a partnership (3 SN §1092f., IV, 2, p. 152)

**Barbarism of Reflection and the Decline of Civilizations**
- Vico's theory of decline based on analysis of Roman Empire history (see p. 126)
- Interested in decline of other cultures, particularly Greek culture
- Internal disintegration has different possible outcomes
- Fate of European culture remained open question for Vico (see p. 126)
- Portrait of Vico shows fear of civilization's decline (see p. 126)


#### Vico's analysis of cultural decline: spiritual causes, barbarism of reflection, and three outcomes: monarchy, subjection, or collapse.

**Vico's Explanation of Decadence: Spiritual and Intellectual Decline**

**Barbarism of Reflection (Forma Mentis)**
- Characterized by formal use of intellect, loss of substantial foundation
- Decline of emotional ties that keep cultures together
- Rationally calculating attitude towards fellow human beings
- Lack of faith in work for the community
- Annihilation of authentically lived intersubjectivity
- General sociopsychological irritability
- Particular bearers: ambitious intellectuals who despise one another but are pathologically dependent on mutual recognition

**Decadence and Skepticism**
- Accumulation of facts at expense of substantial philosophy
- Sophistry ignored by Vico, Hellenistic tendencies seen as germs of decadence
- Skeptics slander truth, not unknowable, but unable to see it

**Political Decadence**
- Decline of public virtues
- General aspiration to accumulate money and power
- Inability to cooperate
- Contempt for laws
- Absolutization of private life
- Dissolution of basic moral sentiments
- Three possible modes of recourse: passage from democracy to monarchy, subjection by stronger nations, or rebarbarization and reprivatization (return to age of gods)

**Rebarbarization and Reprivatization**
- Destruction of cultural conquests, but obliteration of barbarism of reflection
- Occurs when a people do not submit to monarchy or allow domination by better peoples
- Condition of atoms, distrustful subjects working towards elimination of friends, no common truth recognized, horrible solitude.


#### Vico's thoughts on history, decadence, and the role of law in society.

**Vico's Doctrine of Decadence and the Necessity of Historical Development**

**Background:**
- Vico speaks of "riflessiva malizia" (reflective malice) and a "barbarism of reflection" in late Roman epoch
- This culture is more terrible than earlier barbarism as it is vile and false, not merely "generous savagery"
- Providence obliterates this culture to allow survivors to disabuse themselves of luxury and malice, reacquiring piety, faith, and truth

**Vico's Theory:**
- Doctrine based on analysis of late Roman epoch and understanding of the process of disenchantment and enlightenment
- Guarantees the nomothetic character of Vico's System of Natural Law (SN)
- Cycles vs. Circular Structure: Vico prefers a circular structure for theoretical foundations
- Differences between De universi iuris and SN
  * Similarities in structure but missing themes of medieval fiefs and cyclical theory
  * Christ event has no place in Vichian conception of history, giving it a pagan stamp

**Problems with Vico's Project:**
1. Lack of investigation into problems arising from the model posited
2. Undervaluation of Middle Ages as barbarism returned, even for a Catholic author
3. Christ event is increasingly superseded by sentiment of unavoidable catastrophe threatening developed cultures
4. Absence of positive aspects in modern age and belief that it may face decline
5. Urgent obligation to act and impede potential decadence
6. Criticism of Hellenistic philosophies for antipolitical individualism, contrasting them with "political philosophers"
7. Call to put ideas into practice rather than just observing the laws of history.


#### Vico's "Pratica della scienza nuova" and the role of philosophy, religion, and reflection in societal decadence.

**Vico's "Pratica della scienza nuova" (Practice of the New Science)**

**Limitations of Knowledge**:
- True knowledge is not generously effusive, it is limited to academics
- The only deeper joy than knowledge of truth lies in its universal communication

**Vico's Advice for Nations**:
- In 1731, Vico wrote "Pratica della scienza nuova" (Practice of the New Science) as a concluding chapter to his Seminario Noleggibile (Science for Rent)
- Aimed to counsel on impeding or slowing down the decadence of nations
- Advised philosophers within academies to teach Platonic-Christian metaphysics, then live righteously in the political world

**Education and Formation**:
- Vico thought of forming an intellectual and political elite educated holistically across disciplines: metaphysics, physics, ethics, pedagogy (iconomica), politics, and jurisprudence
- Theories of social sciences have reflexivity that can make them self-destructive

**Vico's Missing Inclusion**:
- In 1744, Vico did not include "Pratica" in the last edition of his Science for Rent
- Possible conjectures:
    - Vico became a theoreticism representative, disowning practical tasks
    - Fear of questioning nomothetic theory of history
    - Concern about Oedipus effect of prognoses nullifying themselves

**Reason and Motivation**:
- Reason can ground the good but not motivate action, unlike religion
- Philosophers are "the old men of the nations" unable to produce effects in reality on their own


#### Vico's analysis of Homer: philosophical foundation for understanding ancient poetry as a historical source.

**Giambattista Vico on Homer**

**Friedrich August Wolf's Essay (1807)**
- Recognized Vico as a forerunner of his approach to Homer in the Museum der Alterthums-Wissenschaft
- Criticized Vico for lack of historical rigor, but praised his work as "one of the most extraordinary to have sprung from the head of an Italian intellectual"

**Vico's Interpretation of Homer (SN Book III)**
- Noted that Vico went beyond philological analysis in providing a philosophical foundation for the idea that poetry could be the product of an entire people and still be a masterpiece
- Vico applied principles from Book II to understand the essence and specificity of ancient poetry, considering Homer as the greatest poet
- Acknowledged that Homer did not possess "sapienza riposta" (hidden wisdom), but acknowledged his influence on philosophy
- Analyzed Homeric poems as historical sources and examples of archaic poetry's role in understanding natural law and early customs

**Vico's Impact on Homer Interpretation**
- Recognized the importance of considering literary texts from both aesthetic and sociological perspectives
- Contributed to understanding Homer's works as "political histories of ancient Greek customs" and "two great treasuries of the natural law of the Greek tribes"
- Found empirical documentation in Homeric poems for his reconstruction of the heroic age mentality, which was different from the age of men.


#### Giambattista Vico's analysis of Homer: heroic poetry, different ages, language, and origins

**Vico's Interpretation of Homer:**

**Differences Between Iliad and Odyssey:**
- In Homer, kings insult each other using harsh language not used by modern comedies
- Iliad heroes have "mental weakness," "violent youth," and "seething passions" vs. Odyssey's cunning, deceit, and trickery (Odysseus)
- Anger and pride correspond to youth; subterfuges and stratagems to old age
- Hardness and severity in Iliad versus hints of luxury in Odyssey
- Geographical differences indicate different authors: Iliad from northeast, Odyssey from southwest Greece

**Homer as an Acronym for Poetic Development:**
- Peoples of Greece claimed to be Homer's homeland due to collected songs
- Redaction by Peisistratids organized material into a systematized form

**Vico's View on Homer:**
- Some argue Vico denied existence of historical person called Homer, others suggest he affirmed but not as sole author
- Homer is a poetic character representing popular Greek poetry
- Coherence important for aesthetic value, but single author not necessary for organic unity

**Homer's Role in Greek Culture:**
- Founder of Greek culture and father of all known poets
- No further tragic figures after him as heroes were no longer being created during this age.
- Later poets imitated Homer freely and creatively, not as servile copies.


#### Vico's analysis of Greek and Roman poetry and history, focusing on poetic genres and developmental patterns.

**Vico's Approach to Literature and History**

**Overview**:
- Vico treats Greek literature after Homer, focusing on dramatic and lyric poetry
- No attempt to order genres from a philosophical perspective like Hegel
- Distinguishes two kinds of lyric poets and two kinds of tragic poets

**Lyric Poetry**:
- First group: Authors of hymns to gods
- Second (or third) group: Melic poets, with Pindar as the most important figure

**Dramatic Poetry**:
- Originates in dithyrambs and satyr plays
- Transitions from Aeschylus' tragedies to Old Comedy, then Sophocles and Euripides
- New Comedy: Recognizes possibility of philosophically inspired poetry; influenced by Socratic moral philosophy

**Roman History**:
- Vico has a spotty knowledge of Greek and Hellenistic history
- Impressive understanding of Roman history, particularly early period
- Recognized important discoveries but also errors due to underestimating variations between nations and relying too much on "a-priori" framework of development

**Aeneid's Arrival in Latium**:
- Challenged the mythical arrival of Aeneas in Latium
- Hypothesis of a Greek colony in Latium: Romans destroyed it, Greeks became clients
- Interesting approach to explaining narratives relative to Aeneas as historical truths rather than rejecting them outright.


#### Vico's interpretation of Roman history: conflicts between orders and the role of jurists in law development.

**Vico's Interpretation of Roman History:**
- **Conflict between Orders**: Vico differed from Niebuhr but agreed with Mommsen on the origins of plebs from clients.
- **Most Significant Steps in Roman History**: Vico saw Roman history as a battle between the orders, focusing on the magnanimity of plebeians and obstinacy of fathers.
- **Role of Jurists**: Jurists contributed to the development of Roman law by allowing legal system to progress while maintaining stability.
- **Polybius vs Machiavelli**: Polybius attributed Rome's rise to religion, while Machiavelli focused on plebs' magnanimity; Vico saw both as partial truths.
- **Law of the Twelve Tables**: A turning point in Roman history due to its significance for legal equality and codification.
- **Vico vs Niebuhr**: Both identified legendary period before law of Twelve Tables, but Niebuhr's philological criticism surpasses Vico's considerations.
- **Romulus as a Poetic Character**: Vico viewed Roman kings as poetic characters representing laws and institutions.
- **Mythology vs History**: Vico believed mythology borders on poetry and history; Niebuhr agreed that ancient songs are important sources.
- **Historical Figures in Greek History**: Vico identified some Greek figures, like Draco, Solon, Lycurgus, and Aesop, as legendary or poetic characters.
- **Servius Tullius' Census**: Important discovery attributed to the sixth century BC king of Rome.
- **Census Development**: Vico claimed that classic order of centuries was introduced much later than traditionally thought.


#### Exploring Roman law's development through the law of the Twelve Tables and Vico's analysis.

**Giambattista Vico's Interpretation of Roman Law**

**Census and Property Rights**:
- Plebeians were granted **bonitary ownership** of fields, ending their status as wage laborers
- This formed the basis for aristocratic republics, not democratic ones
- After expulsion of kings, plebeians were treated worse by patricians
- Tribunes protected plebeian property from usurpation by nobles
- Plebeians no longer paid tributes to nobles, but all citizens paid taxes to the state

**Misconceptions and Errors**:
- Vico confused details about the census and assemblies
- He incorrectly attributed the democratic census to Q. Fabius Maximus Rullianus
- Mistakenly believed that the order of centuries was the same as the subdivision into three orders
- Incorrectly identified the Tribal Assembly with the Plebeian Tribal Council

**The Law of the Twelve Tables**:
- Vico took interest in the problem of how this ancient legal source can be understood
- Rejected the legend that Romans studied Greek laws as legendary
- Recognized similarities between Greek and Roman laws as typological or explainable by his doctrine of poetic characters

**Vichian Interpretations of Specific Laws**:
- Erroneously limited "suus" in hereditary law to sons, not daughters
- Misunderstood the meaning of the **lex Canuleia**, which allowed plebeian-patrician marriages
    - Vico believed it granted plebeians right to marriage and intestate succession, but this is mistaken
    - Rightly recognized that for archaic consciousness, matrimony is tied to social rank


#### The development of Roman democracy: marriage, plebeians, and civil law.

**Roman Marriage: Conventio in Manum and Confarreatio**
- **Confarreatio**: Ancient Roman marriage form for patricians/nobility
- Only allowed for plebeians after the lex Poetelia, which eliminated nexum (debt bondage) around 326 BCE
- Important developments in Roman marriage law:
  - **lex Ogulnia**: Allowed plebeians admission to priestly roles around 300 BCE
  - Publilius' laws: Possibly conferred legal force to plebiscites and prescribed censor election with at least one plebeian (339 BCE)
- **lex Hortensia** of 287 BCE reached parity between plebiscites and laws, marking end of conflict of orders

**Vico's Interest in Roman History: The Middle Ages and Feudalism**
- Vico's interest in the Middle Ages is uncharacteristic for 18th century
- Anticipates Romanticism, but differs as he does not focus on Christianity (focuses on forma mentis similarity to archaic ages)
- Middle Ages seen as era of barbarism returned with akin spirit to ancient peoples
- Lacking interest in unique traits or influences from ancient culture on the Middle Ages.


#### Vico's perspective on feudalism and its connection to ancient Rome's clientages in medieval culture.

**Vico's Perspective on the Middle Ages:**
* Departs from fiction that Middle Ages are a new beginning, recognizes religious connection to ancient times (3 SN §1047)
* Identifies saints with Roman gods in art and literature (3 SN §816, 3 SN §1050)
* Importance of symbolic forms due to illiteracy (3 SN §485, 3 SN §1051)
* Return of duels, ordeals, heroic incursions, and slavery (3 SN §675, 3 SN §1400)
* Asylums return as churches and abbeys for persecuted individuals (no specific reference in text)
* Feudalism: spiritual foundation of medieval culture (3 SN §25, 3 SN §599ff.)

**Comparison between Ancient Rome and Medieval Feudal Law:**
* Vico's discovery of typological affinities (3 SN §1075)
* Feudal law is not a new creation in the Middle Ages but a basis for ancient Roman law (3 SN §25, 3 SN §602, 3 SN §1085)
* Central power reinforced through feudal law by French kings (3 SN §1398)
* Misunderstanding of centrifugal forces that hinder effective state power formation in Germany.


#### Giambattista Vico's analysis of feudalism, law, and poetry in the Middle Ages.

**Vico's Recognition of Feudalism**
* Vico recognizes the essence of feudalism in the gradual connection between **vassalage** as an institution of the law of persons and **benefice** as an institution of the law of things
* He explores the ambiguity of Italian and Latin terms (beneficium/beneficio) meaning both benefit and feud

**Two Types of Vassals**
* Dependent peasant vassals: compared to Roman plebeians, ownership to bonitary ownership
* Noble vassals: compared to Roman patricians, ownership to quiritary ownership

**Comparisons Between Ancient Rome and Feudal Law**
* Some comparisons are "far-fetched"
* Interesting comparison of mancipatio (mancipation) and homage, both involving the hand as a legal symbol

**Relationships of Civil Law in Feudalism**
* Barons had great military and political power
* Liege vassals obliged to have same friends/enemies as lords
* Entire states could become feuds of other states

**Later Development of Feudalism**
* Loss of baron power due to civil wars led to formation of monarchies
* Reception of Roman law important in this development

**Medieval Poetry**
* Vico had limited knowledge of medieval poetry, but was interested in it
* Believed ancient writers were poets, their poetry consisted of religious hymns or heroic histories
* Familiar with Dante's work, saw him as the "Homero de' tempi nostri" (the Homer of our times)

**Dante's Poetry and Vico's Interpretation**
* Dante was misunderstood in Vico's time for his crudeness
* Vico argued Dante's poetry was powerful because born of an age with communication difficulties
* Believed Dante would have been even greater if he hadn't known Latin or studied scholastic philosophy

**Vico's View on His Contemporary World**
* In his correspondence, Vico expressed belief that his age was a "delicate and flashy" period
* Saw it as a time dominated by "salon philosophy" and sensualist/hedonist ideas
* Believed this philosophy would lead to individual pleasure at the expense of community cohesion


#### Vico's critique of intellectuals and decline of Enlightenment culture in the modern age

**Vico's Critique of Enlightenment Culture**

**Intellectuals**:
- Contribute to the dissolution of common wisdom rather than applying it (V, p. 214)
- Greek philosophy ended in metaphysics that was not useful to society (V, p. 207)
- Criticizes Cartesianism for destroying traditional humanistic formation and neglecting probabilities (V, p. 206f., p. 215ff.)

**Historiography**:
- In ruins due to lack of interest in moral and political questions (V, p. 206)

**Modern Intellectuals**:
- Limited to compiling knowledge without contributing new insights (V, p. 207)
- Empty erudition that does not make wiser those who cultivate it (V, p. 214)

**Critique of Modern Age**:
- Lack of experimentation in physics and skepticism in medicine (206f.)
- Criticism of Protestantism for allowing individual spirit to be divine rule (V, p. 202)
- Preference for Jesuit probabilism over Jansenism (V, p. 202)

**Understanding of Modern Science and Culture**:
- Vico's judgment on modern science and culture is not accurate (Croce, 1980, p. 217f.)
- Importance of Enlightenment and its impact on culture democratization (Bayle to Encyclopedists)

**Recognition of Modern Trends**:
- Triumph of science and technology over nature (identification with what can be made)
- Subjugation and destruction of nature
- Decline in ancient educational culture
- Specialization of knowledge and destruction of wisdom
- Slow extinguishing of religion
- Dissolution of philosophy into analytic intelligence and irrationalism
- Growing erudition without relevance to existential questions
- Development of social sciences rejecting value rationality
- Formation of parasitic intellectuals interested in privileges or private pleasure
- Decline of fantasy, emotional culture, and public good awareness.

**Possible Diagnosis of Our Time**:
- Lack of orientation in political system due to external influences and lack of legitimation by intellectuals
- Diffusion of hedonism and consumerism sacrificing substantial values
- Gaping emptiness and solitude of modern humans
- Decline in sense of public good, responsibility for future generations, and awareness of providence.

**Limitations of Vico's Analysis**:
- Failure to consider possibility of environmental disasters or nuclear catastrophes destroying human life on the planet.

#### Vico's Influence on European Thought: From Montesquieu to Hegel

**Vico's Influence on Other Thinkers**

**Montesquieu**:
- Montesquieu was in Naples in 1729, near Vico's house, but did not mention Vico in his diary from that period.
- It is unclear if Montesquieu bought Vico's book or met him.
- Montesquieu's influence by Vico is uncertain; Montesquieu's ideas seem to be different from Vico's.

**Rousseau**:
- Rousseau was in Venice in 1743, where interest in the SN was concentrated.
- Parallelisms found between Rousseau and Vico suggest possible influence.
- However, the connection remains a conjecture.

**Piranesi**:
- A recent thesis suggests Vico influenced Piranesi's architectural fantasies.
- This thesis is fascinating but less justifiable than other influences documented.

**German Thinkers**:
- Johann Georg Hamann was one of the first to mention Vico in Germany, around 1777.
- Hamann recognized Vico's philological approach after obtaining the SN.
- Herder also praised Vico for founding a school of human science.
- However, it is unclear how deeply these thinkers studied Vico.

**Hegel and the German Consciousness**:
- Hegel did not appear to know Vico's work or its translation.
- Despite some philosophers recognizing Vico's relevance, he did not penetrate general German consciousness.

**Italian Philosophers**:
- Many Italian philosophers and poets were influenced by Vico starting in the early 19th century.
- Vichian influences can be seen in Ugo Foscolo's poetry and Alessandro Manzoni's work.
- Catholic thinkers like Antonio Rosmini were also influenced by Vico.

**Francesco De Sanctis, Bertrando Spaventa, Benedetto Croce, and Giovanni Gentile**:
- These 19th-century Italian philosophers developed Hegelian philosophy on their own terms, inspired by Vico.

**Jules Michelet**:
- Michelet was presented with Vico's work by Victor Cousin and De Angelis, an exiled intellectual from Naples.
- Michelet became a significant proponent of Vico in France and translated the SN into French, bringing Vico Europe-wide fame.
- However, Michelet's translation is considered a free paraphrase rather than an accurate translation.


#### Vico's Influence on Sociology and Philosophy: From Comte to Joyce

**Vico's Influence on Sociology and Philosophy**

**Origins of Sociology**:
- Origin of sociology from the worry of preserving cohesive forces in enlightened societies, without which common life becomes difficult
