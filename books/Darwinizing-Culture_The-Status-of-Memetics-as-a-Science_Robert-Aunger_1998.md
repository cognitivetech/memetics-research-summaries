# Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science, by Robert Aunger (1998)

> The publication in 1998 of Susan Blackmore's bestselling 'The Meme Machine' re-awakened the debate over the highly controversial field of memetics. In the past few years, there has been an explosion of interest in 'memes'. The one thing noticeably missing has been any kind of proper debate over the validity of a concept regarded by many as scientifically suspect. This book pits leading intellectuals, (both supporters and opponents of meme theory), against each other to battle it out, and state their case. With a forward by Daniel Dennett, and contributions form Dan Sperber, David Hll, Robert Boyd, Susan Blackmore, Henry Plotkin, and others, the result is a thrilling and challenging debate that will perhaps mark a turning point for the field, and for future research. Superbly edited by Robert Aunger, this is a thought provoking book that will fascinate, stimulate, (and occasionally perhaps infuriate) a broad range of readers including psychologists, biologists, philosophers, linguists, and anthropologists. - [Darwinizing Culture](https://www.amazon.com/Darwinizing-Culture-Status-Memetics-Science/dp/0192632442?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

### CHAPTER 1 Introduction - Robert Aunger

**Evolutionary Theory: The Age of Universal Darwinism**
* **Development of various fields applying evolutionary theory** (ecology, economics, psychology, linguistics, epistemology, computational science, medicine, psychiatry, chemistry, physics)
* **Replicator dynamic**: abstract algorithm for the evolutionary process
	+ Units of information with ability to reproduce using resources
	+ Selection and mutation of replicators
	+ Applicable to various phenomena, but limited insights in social sciences

**Meme Concept: Controversy and Development**
* **Introduced by Richard Dawkins (1982): idea that spreads through social transmission**
* **Lack of development and enthusiasm from cultural/social anthropologists and fine arts**
	+ Lakatos' non-progressive research program (Imre Lakatos, 1970)
	+ Criticism: vague definition, no fixed target or predictions
	+ Analogy to genes deceptive, meme concept a "dangerous idea" (Martin Gardner, 2000; Jaron Lanier, 1999)

**Memetics as a Science of Culture**
* **Divided opinions on the potential development and applicability**
	+ Critics argue that memes are not observable in the brain or natural language (Dan Dennett, 1995)
	+ High mutation rates, purposeful decision-making, and mixing/matching of memes make them problematic replicators.


#### Introductory discussion on the definition and nature of memes, with contrasting perspectives between mentalist and behaviorist approaches in Memetics research.

**Dennett's Perspective on Memetics:**
* Dennett cites Stephen J. Gould's view that biological evolution and cultural change are fundamentally different (Dennett 1995:355)
* Biological evolution is a process of constant divergence without joining branches, while in human history, transmission across lineages is the major source of cultural change (Dennett 1995:356)
* Meme concept may not be useful for understanding cultural change due to its fast and combinatorial nature, making it difficult to identify selective pressures or ecological correlations (Dennett 1995:356)
* Memes may originate through a process of 'descent with modification,' but determining their relationships is challenging due to replication in different media (Dennett 1995:356)

**Criticism of Dennett's Arguments:**
* Some criticisms suggest that Dennett's arguments are empirical claims about meme transmission and replication parameters, which may not be true (Lake 1999)
* These criticisms do not invalidate the meme concept or prove its impossibility but indicate the presence of poorly functioning memes in circulation (Dennett 1995)

**Definition of Meme:**
* A unit of cultural inheritance or information residing in a brain (Dawkins 1982:109)
* Memory item that propagates itself by leaping from brain to brain via imitation (Dawkins 1976:206)
* Can be behaviors, artifacts, ideas, etc. (Dawkins 1976:206)
* Replicating information structures in brains are unlikely, according to neuroscience (Gatherer 1998)

**Behaviorist Perspective on Memes:**
* Memetics should describe change in populations by counting cultural phenomena like artefactual forms instead of mental states (Gatherer 1998)
* Artefacts propagate independently of their creators and can serve as the proper empirical arm of memetics (Gatherer 1998)
* Activities like making pots are 'genotypes' in this view, while mentalists call them phenotypic manifestations of memes-in-brains.

**Mentalist Perspective on Memes:**
* Memetics aims to describe change by counting up how many people have the beliefs or knowledge to produce such artifacts (Gatherer 1998)
* Defining a meme/host relationship is essential in this perspective.

**Disarray in Memetics:**
* There is disarray at a fundamental level regarding the definition and understanding of culture as the explanatory target of memetics (this brief foray into attempts at defining memes).


#### The controversy surrounding the definition and linking of culture and memes in memetics. Two main approaches: meme-as-germ (epidemiology) and meme-as-gene (evolutionary biology). Difficulties with defining memes and identifying mechanisms for replication, selection, variation, and transmission. Theoretical foundations and differences between the two schools.

**Culture and Meme Concepts:**
* Culture: social construction, text, behaviors, artifacts or mental entities (ideas/beliefs/values)
* Memetics vs. culture: memes as replicators or cultural strategy
	+ Memes exist or do not
	+ Debate on definition and existence of memes
* Approaches to linking memes to culture:
	1. Analogy to pathogens (meme transmission)
	2. Replicator theory (interactor)
* Difficulties in defining memes: lack of standard codification, reliance on gene analogy
* Memetics and evolutionary biology vs. epidemiology perspectives
* Two rival paradigms: 'meme-as-germ' and 'meme-as-gene' schools.

**Memeticists Definitions:**
* Memes as mental entities or thoughts (cognitivists)
* Some memeticists exclude emotions, arguing they don't replicate or are not infectious
* Debate on the nature and existence of memes

**Misconceptions and Challenges:**
* Lack of clear definition and standard codification of meme concept
* Overreliance on gene analogy for understanding memes
* Ignoring difficulties associated with mental states (behaviorists)
* Memetics remains linked to biology but not ontologically.


#### Memetics: Debating the nature and explanatory power of memes in culture and evolution

**Memetic Epidemiology: A Critique**

**Overview**:
- Memetic epidemiology ignores how 'virus' duplicates itself or mutates, regarding innovation as rare and unique occurrences
- Identifying selective forces on a pathogen is not a high priority for cultural diffusionists
- Evolutionists acknowledge the possibility of independent occurrence of innovations but typically ignore the source

**Critique of Memetic View**:
- Culture may not be composed only of socially transmitted information units
- Some cultural phenomena may be changed by forces other than mental replicators
- Disputes exist on whether culture is properly seen as composed of independently transmitted information units and the nature of memes as replicators

**Radical Memetics vs. Alternative Views**:
- Radical memetics aims to explain a wide range of phenomena, including brain evolution, language, consciousness, and self
- Blackmore's concept of 'memetic drive' distinguishes memetics from alternative theories like evolutionary psychology and gene-culture coevolution
- Criticisms include the evolutionary paradoxes addressed by Blackmore, such as hypertrophy of human brain, extravagance of language, and altruism in large groups

**Memetic Drive vs. Lamarckianism**:
- Hull argues memetics is not Lamarckian because memes are replicators, not interactors
- Memetic perspective is important to adopt when positing novel evolutionary processes

**Restriction of Memetics to Imitation**:
- Hull takes issue with Blackmore's restriction of memetics to information learned through imitation
- This restricts memetics to a single species and cannot explain more general evolutionary trends in animal families.


#### Introducing Memetics: Debates on Foundations, Transmission, and Agents

**Memetics: Perspectives from Experts**

**Hull's Perspective**:
- Emphasizes getting results first, then addressing definitional issues later
- Argues against memetics being reduced to biology due to the complexity of human brain and culture
- Promotes memetics as an emerging research program that can help explain population-level phenomena

**Henry Plotkin's Perspective**:
- Distinguishes between surface-level and deep-level memes
- Deep memes are not acquired through a single act of imitation but through integration of experiences and perceptions
- Suggests deeply structured memes may result from naturally selected modules in the brain

**Rosaria Conte's Perspective**:
- Emphasizes memetics should be based on intentional agents with decision-making abilities
- Argues memes can be transmitted without communication or overt imitation
- Distinguishes memetic transmission processes based on sender and receiver's psychological abilities

**Common Theme**:
- Memetics must be grounded in a solid psychological foundation


#### Debate on the Evolution of Culture: Meme Theory vs. Dual Inheritance and Population Thinking. Arguments for both genetic and cultural transmission in evolution.

**Meme Transmission: Multiple Perspectives**

**Conte's Perspective:**
- Emphasizes beliefs as well as other mental states can be transmitted through social interaction
- Beliefs differ from obligations and have unique transmission parameters
- Focuses on norms as interesting forms of memes due to their psychological qualities

**Laland & Odling-Smee's Perspective:**
- Supplement memetics with 'niche construction' process
- Organisms modify environments, creating new selection pressures and feedback loops
- Transmission of modified environments called 'ecological inheritance'
- Evolutionary dynamics can be novel when including ecological inheritance
- Theory of cultural evolution during hominid line based on transmission vectors, ecological inheritance, and constructed features in the niche

**Blackmore vs. Laland & Odling-Smee:**
- Competing theories: Blackmore focuses on sexual selection for imitative ability; L&O emphasize non-imitative social learning
- Empirical contest between these theories possible to understand human psychology and cultural transmission

**Boyd & Richerson's Perspective:**
- Critical of memetics' focus on natural selection as mechanism for cumulative adaptation in culture
- Cultural evolution can be considered a pool of information passed via various non-genetic mechanisms without replication
- Population thinking is a more appropriate organizing principle for an evolutionary theory of culture
- Genetic and cultural transmission play roles in continuity of traditions.


#### Critique of memetics: debates on cultural transmission and the concept of culture as complex and non-unitary.

**Sperber's Critique of Meme Theory**

**Key Point**: Similarity between cultural items does not equate to inheritance. Information for true evolutionary replication must be passed down the causal chain.

**Argument**:
- Many discussions in memetics do not distinguish between similarity and inheritance
- High fidelity copying is a limiting case, not characteristic of most cultural transmission
- Cultural learning involves multiple steps: establishing sender's intention and decoding message meaning
- Sperber's critique aligns with the idea that most culture represents innate responses

**Culture as an Evolutionary Concept**:
- Culture used to denote 'civilized taste' but now connotes 'shared beliefs'
- Culture has been democratized to reflect current political sensibilities
- Memetic perspective depends on the newer, diversified notion of culture to explain its explanatory target

**Criticisms from Anthropologists**:
- Memeticists' ignorance of academic literature on cultural change is galling to professionals in the field
- Memeticists fall into traps recognized and avoided by theoretical traditions in social sciences
- Bloch compares memes to the diffusionist approach, which was criticized for oversimplifying cultural traits as independent units

**Conclusion**:
- Culture is a complex, heterogeneous concept that cannot be easily divided into units
- Identifying these bits of culture may be necessary to broadly accept the utility of the meme approach in social scientific circles.


### CHAPTER 2 The memes eye view - Susan Blackmore

**Susan Blackmore's Perspective on Memetics**

**Meme Definition:**
- Meme: an element of culture passed on by non-genetic means, primarily imitation
- Existence proof not required, as memes exist by definition if people imitate each other and pass on information

**Meme Replicators:**
- Memes are replicators that undergo the evolutionary algorithm (heredity, variation, selection)
- Beneficiaries of any evolutionary process

**Importance of Mimetic Perspective:**
- New solutions to old problems in understanding origins of large brain, language, and unique intelligence

**Definition Debate:**
- Different definitions: imprinting, conditioning, observation, imitation or direct teaching (Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman; Durham)
- Memes acquired by imitation only for true evolutionary process (Blackmore)

**Reproduction vs. Replication:**
- Reproduction: behaviour reproduced but not replicated (washing sweet potatoes, pecking at milk bottles)
- Replication: copying with opportunity for variations to compete and cumulative change (imitation)

**Imitative Learning vs. Other Forms:**
- Imitative learning sustains true evolutionary process and should be included as meme replication processes (Blackmore, in press)

**Research Question:**
- Empirical question: which kinds of social learning can reproduce behaviours with sufficient fidelity to maintain them intact over several generations and allow for selection between variants and cumulative change?


#### The role of imitation in human evolution: memes and the dual replicator theory.

**The Evolutionary Significance of Imitation and Memes**

**Imitation as a Driving Force for Evolution**:
- Imitation has the capacity to sustain an evolutionary process
- Restricting meme definition to imitated behaviors allows for clearer understanding
- Humans, dolphins, songbirds, elephants, and chimpanzees have memes as they can imitate novel behaviors or sounds
- Complex human skills like reading, writing, and direct instruction build on the ability to imitate and could not occur without it

**Meme Transmission and Evolution**:
- Variation in memes introduced through degradation of human memory and communication, as well as creative recombination
- Selection occurs due to limitations on available channels for communication, time, and other storage space
- Memes evolve through a process similar to natural selection, with the evolutionary algorithm driving creativity

**The Human Brain and Memetics**:
- The advent of memes changed evolutionary ground rules, leading to the large human brain's development
- Memes coevolved with genes, shaping human evolution and creating the need for a larger brain
- Theories on the origins of large human brains focus on social demands and complex social environments

**Mimetic Skill and Memetics**:
- Mimetic skill refers to conscious, self-initiated representational acts that are intentional but not linguistic (Donald)
- This concept is different from memetics, which focuses on the replicative ability of imitated actions as memes
- Deacon's theory emphasizes the coevolution of language and the human brain, with symbols acting like parasitic organisms driving selection pressure for larger brains.


#### Memetic Drive Theory: Human Brain Evolved for Memes, Not Genes (memetics, imitation, cultural evolution, meme fountains, memetic selection, language, brain development)

**Theory of Human Brain Evolution: Memetic Drive**
* Theories that explain human brain evolution often assume it was designed by evolution for the benefit of genes (neo-Darwinian assumption)
* Proposed alternative theory: human brain was primarily designed for the benefit of memes
* Critical turning point in human evolution: acquisition of ability to imitate
* Imitation reduces learning costs, benefits both imitator and gene pool
* Memetic drive leads to culture expansion and increased brain size
* Meme fountains (individuals best at imitation) have an advantage and spread genes for imitation
* Selection pressure for ability to discriminate useful vs. useless memes
* Sexual selection may add to pressures on genes to produce brains capable of imitating successful memes
* Language as a high-fidelity, fecundity, and longevity meme drives the spread of genes for language ability
* Testable assumptions: imitation requires a lot of processing capacity, memetic drive can increase brain size.


#### Susan Blackmore's argument on meme-gene coevolution: Memes spread through imitation, affecting gene selection and creating brain adaptations.

**Meme-Gene Coevolution Theory**

**Imitative Ability**:
- Genes for imitative ability are selectively favored
- Imitative ability increases slowly until a rapid transition occurs
- After the transition, memes spread like an epidemic and there is a dramatic increase in imitative ability as well as mean fitness

**Meme-Gene Coevolution**:
- The strategy of imitating enhanced imitators will spread under a wide variety of conditions
- This opens up new ways of testing these hypotheses

**Criticisms and Clarifications**:
- Critics have raised difficulties or questions about the proposed process of meme-gene coevolution
- Some critics gained the impression that the human brain is an all-purpose meme machine, designed to copy any old memes
- This is not so, as our imitation is highly selective

**Implications of Meme-Gene Coevolution**:
- Once memes arise, they evolve by **memetic competition** (high quality memes spread at the expense of low quality memes) and evolve faster than the genes that made them possible
- **Meme fountains** (who have all the useful memes as well as those that have spread for other reasons) survive better both because they have more useful memes and because other people copy them, giving them added power and status
- The memes that succeed in **memetic competition** change the environment in which genes are selected, giving an advantage to genes which help a person imitate the currently successful memes

**Examples**:
- The **language instinct** or **language organ** argument may have been a poor choice as it is a contentious issue
- The human enjoyment of music is a less contentious example
- Dennett's theory is that early hominids just happened to bang on a log and enjoyed the sound, and people copied it
- Memes or features of the environment make some versions more infectious and spread at the expense of others
- **Meme-meme competition** determines the direction taken by the evolution of music, dance, art, and literature, as well as sexual selection

**Religion**:
- Religions may have spread not because they are true or help anyone, but because they are successful **memes** - **copy-me** instructions backed up with threats, promises, and ways of preventing their claims from being tested
- A ritual dance supposed to bring rain may coincide with the advent of rain, and a flamboyant version may be copied more
- People not only copy these successful memes, but mate with the people who display them, so that genes implicated in being good at these dances tend to increase


#### Brain as memetic survival machine: genes and memes in coevolutionary competition

**Meme Evolution and the Brain**

**Memes Survive for Reasons Beyond Genetic Advantage**:
- Some memes survive despite being maladaptive for genes
- They are adaptive for themselves and the memeplexes they belong to

**Brain as Analogous to Immune System**:
- Brain is like an immune system that recognizes and copies successful memes
- Genes produce a larger brain to cope with these memes, but also select for beneficial ones
- Memetic competition drives the evolution of the brain's ability to select memes

**Meme-Gene Coevolution**:
- Brain was designed to copy successful memes, both those that benefit genes and purely memetic reasons
- Human intelligence is about the selection of memes
- Memes can "get off the leash" as they are transmitted horizontally at faster rates than genetic change

**Artificial Life Model Simulations**:
- Bull's model simulates the interactions between two replicators (genes and memes) with different speeds
- Higher interdependence and faster meme evolution can benefit memes, while gene evolution degrades to a random walk

**Implications of Meme-Gene Coevolution**:
- Memes depend on genes for their propagation through the brains they shape
- But with self-replicating computers or automated information copying, memes could exist without human intervention


#### The Memetic Perspective: Coevolution of Memes and Technology.

**Meme Evolution and Human Nature**

**Memetics**:
- Provides a new vision of human nature
- Memes spread not necessarily for benefit of genes or individuals, but for their own replication
- Cultural entities are current winners in a fierce competition to be copied
- Memes may have evolved alongside humans, co-opting the machinery of gene replication

**Memetic Transformation of Understanding**:
- Memetics might fundamentally transform our understanding of human nature
- Altruistic behaviors may persist due to their ability to attract friends and facilitate meme propagation
- Religions and cults use clever tricks to perpetuate themselves
- Alternative therapies that do not work can thrive due to the power of placebo effects
- Bizarre ideas like aliens or free will as memes that succeed despite being false
- Inner self, consciousness, and free will may be memeplexes created for meme replication

**Memetics and Evolution**:
- Meme-gene coevolution: memes and brains coevolved in the past
- Later steps of meme evolution include writing, transportation technologies, printing, and the Internet
- Memes are driving forces behind cultural innovations and transformations

### CHAPTER 3 Taking memetics seriously Memetics will be what we make it - David L. Hull

**Memetics: A Constructivist Approach**

**Postmodern Constructivism**:
- Claims that nothing is truly discovered, but rather constructed or fabricated
- Science is a constructed and evolving process with constraints on how it can be construed

**Memetics as a New Science**:
- Memetics aims to treat conceptual change scientifically
- Differentiates from linguistics by modeling on selection in evolutionary biology

**Definition of Memes**:
- Memes are units of cultural transmission that are passed on through imitation
- Distinguished from individual learning and other forms of social learning like tits opening bottles or monkeys washing sweet potatoes
- Limited to a restricted set of human behaviors

**Comparison to Genetics**:
- Criticisms that memetics is not analogous to genetics due to particulate nature of genes
- Memetics does not rely on analogical reasoning, but rather a general account of selection applicable to various replication processes

**Memetic Selection**:
- Similarities between genetic and memetic selection, with the latter not limited to human beings
- Memetics can include a variety of different selection processes, with analysis determining how well each fits the general account of selection.


#### The evolution of memetics: Clarifying the concept of a meme through operational criteria and empirical investigation

**The Debate on Population Thinking vs Natural Selection in Understanding Culture**

**Population Thinking vs Natural Selection**:
- Boyd and Richerson argue that population thinking is more fundamental than natural selection in conceptualizing culture as material causes
- People find it difficult to understand the concept of 'population thinking' compared to natural selection
- Measuring traits and finding means/modes does not provide insight into the variation necessary for evolutionary processes
- Convincing people that species and sociocultural correlates lack 'essences' is challenging
- Evolutionary theory itself, as proposed by Ernst Mayr, is seen as having an essence or set of axioms

**Clarity in Science**:
- Criticisms of the lack of conceptual clarity in memetics arise from unreal expectations of how clear familiar terms were in science
- The term 'gene' itself was not initially clear when introduced in 1909, with different interpretations emerging over time
- Similar debates have occurred around the evolutionary gene concept and its application to memes

**Defining Memes**:
- A meme is the least unit of sociocultural information relative to a selection process that has favorable or unfavorable selection bias exceeding its endogenous tendency to change
- This definition is not operational, but it can emerge from empirical investigations as one applies memetics concepts to real cases
- Memeticists should engage in both empirical investigations and theoretical development to improve their understanding of memes


#### The origins and progression of memetics as a scientific research program: debating the starting point and evaluating its advancements.

**Memetics Research Program**

**Background:**
- Memetics as a research program has been around for over twenty years
- Criticisms raised by Robert Aunger regarding its lack of progress
- Debate on when memetics originated and who coined the term

**Origins of Memetics:**
- Richard Semon published "Die Mneme als erhaltendes Prinzip" in 1904
- First English translation in 1914 as "The Mneme"
- Other authors had been urging study of conceptual change as a selection process before Dawkins

**Progress Evaluation:**
- Debate on how to evaluate progress: first publication or serious investigation?
- Memetics should be evaluated when a reasonable number of people began developing it

**Criticisms and Misconceptions:**
- Confusion over neologisms and unappreciated precursors in memetics research
- Postmodern fascination with neologisms mystifying, not relevant to progress evaluation

**Current State of Memetics:**
- Dawkins' suggestion about memes did not take off immediately after 1976 publication
- Several books on cultural evolution published during the past twenty-five years but failed to initiate active research program in memetics.

**Conclusion:**
- Memetics research program has had a long history, but its progress should be evaluated based on serious investigation rather than first publications or neologisms.


#### Memetics research: Understanding selection processes beyond genes and organisms as replicators and vehicles.

**Memetics as an Active Research Program**
- Memetics has been an active research program for approximately a dozen years
- Numerous workers from various backgrounds have devoted themselves to expanding the notion of memetic evolution
- No standard higher than career voting exists in science
- Memeticists have their own **Journal of Memetics**
- The British Academy sponsored a conference on memetics in April 1999, and another conference was held at Cambridge the same year

**Progress in Memetics Research**
- Two areas ripe for progress are:
  - Reconstructing conceptual phylogenies
  - Improving understanding of memetic transmission mechanisms
- Paleontologists, biological systematists, and historical linguists have devised the same method of representing phylogenetic relations - **cladograms**
- Reconstruction of linguistic phylogenies is as progressive a research program as its correlate in biological systematics

**Bias Towards Genes and Organisms**
- One of the chief obstacles in understanding memetic evolution is the hold that genes and organisms have on our thinking
- **Dawkins** suggested **replicators** and **vehicles**, while **Hull** proposed **interactors**
- **Genes** can function as both replicators and interactors
- Selection is a process, not just entities (genes or organisms)
- Selection is a process by which environmental interaction produces differential perpetuation


#### Discussion on Lamarckian inheritance in memetic evolution: memes as analogous to genes, not phenotypic characteristics.

**Memetic Evolution and Reductionism vs. Selectionism**

**General Analysis**:
- Selection analysis independent of reduction position
- Both replication and environmental interaction necessary for selection
- "Reduction" does not entail "reducing away"
- Genes and memes have similar modes of transmission

**Misconceptions about Memetic Evolution**:
- Rapid transmission of some memes does not make it faster than genetic evolution
- Lamarckian inheritance misapplied to memetic evolution
  - Inheritance of acquired characteristics requires genetic transmission and phenotypic change
  - Memetic evolution is analogous to gene-based biological evolution, not phenomena like Lamarckian inheritance

**Memetic Transmission**:
- Vertical vs. horizontal transmission in gene-based evolution:
  - Vertical: genes passed down from parents to offspring
  - Horizontal: genetic transfer between organisms (e.g., virus infection)
- In memetic evolution, vertical and horizontal transmission are often discussed
  - Parental teaching is vertical, anything else is horizontal
  - However, this perspective comes from the organism's point of view, not the meme's


#### Memetics: Distinguishing Replication and Implementation through Information and Decoding Challenges in defining the nature of memes, replication, and implementation, including the distinction from genes and decoding difficulties.

**Memetics: Understanding Replication vs Implementation**

**Background:**
- Memetic evolution's basic entities are memes
- Memes determine vertical or horizontal transmission
- Distinction between memes and genetic characteristics

**Replication vs Implementation:**
1. **Replicators**: Information carriers in memetics, such as printed page, floppy disk, etc.
2. **Information**: Central concept for distinguishing replication from implementation (Maynard Smith & Szathmáry, 1995)
3. Difficulty in defining information and its application:
   - Structures contain or hold information (thermodynamic perspective)
   - DNA as an example of encoded and unencoded information
4. Asymmetry between copying instructions and inferring them from the product:
   - Copying instructions is relatively easy
   - Inferring instructions from a product is extremely difficult
5. Nature-nurture issue:
   - Genes code for reaction norms, not traits (Wilkins, 1998)
   - Development is often a many-to-many relation
6. Memetic phenotypes and decoding:
   - Replicators are information or symbolic structures (Lake, 1998)
   - Information transmitted without decoding during replication
7. Distinction between information and structure:
   - Thermodynamicists view all structures as containing information
   - Current analyses of evidence cannot distinguish between encoded and unencoded information in memetics.


#### Comparing memetic evolution to biological evolution: Small populations, selective pressure, and conceptual genealogy in scientific research.

**Understanding Memetics: Replicators and Information Transmission**

**The Relation Between Replication and Translation:**
- In memetics, replication refers to the process of making copies or transmitting information
- Translation involves creating a product based on that information (homocatalysis)
- Genes and memes share similarities in conceptual evolution: potentially infinite rules generating phenotypic performance

**Memetic Evolution:**
- Memetics is a research program that explores the spread of cultural elements through populations
- Rapid conceptual change can occur in small, isolated communities (similar to peripheral isolates in biological evolution)
- Drift and random events may also contribute to memetic change

**The Role of Small Research Teams:**
- Productivity is higher for researchers organized into small research teams within larger communities
- Blau's study on high energy particle physics: scientists in small teams within a large invisible college were more productive
- Hull's study on research groups showed similar findings

**Biological vs. Interspecific Competition:**
- In Science as a Process, Hull studied two research communities (numerical taxonomists and cladists)
- Cladists treated fellow members more gently in referee reports than non-cladists, but this was due to speciation within the cladist group

**Operationalizing Genealogy:**
- In biological evolution, organisms treat close relatives differently based on genealogy (proximity during development)
- In memetics and science, conceptual genealogy defines kin (similar ideas or theories) versus non-kin.


#### Exploring the growth and evaluation of memetics as a research program in cultural evolution. The text discusses the tracing of meme frequencies through time on the Internet, differences between successful and rejected ideas, and the need for testing and coherence within the field.

**Memetics as an Emerging Research Program**

**Background:**
- Memetics: emerging research program in the field of cultural evolution
- Similarities to biological evolution
- Importance of understanding meme transmission and frequency changes

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Progressive: demonstrating significant progress but must continue on this trajectory
- Testing necessary for advancement
- Addressing fundamental objections

**Examples of Memetic Transmission:**
- Changes in English language usage over time
- Replacement of terms like 'stewardess' and 'mailman'

### CHAPTER 4 Culture and psychological mechanisms - Henry Plotkin

**Culture and Psychological Mechanisms**

**Darwinian Approaches to Culture**:
- Two possible approaches:
  1. Evolution of culture and human capacity for entering into culture
  2. Cultural evolution, focusing on how cultures change
- Memetics was born from the second approach, embracing universal Darwinism

**Universal Darwinism**:
- Originates in the 1860s with T.H. Huxley's suggestion to extend evolution theory to individual development
- Basic premise: Common processes of variation, selection, and conservation of selected variants apply to the transformation of complex biological entities and systems

**Memetics and Psychological Mechanisms**:
- Memetics needs to be underpinned by a knowledge of psychological mechanisms
- Social scientists' view of mechanism is different from natural scientists':
  - Natural scientists see mechanism as something physical, while social scientists see it as a rule describing an interaction or process
- Memetics has been criticized for reductionism and simple-mindedness
- This is refuted by appealing to psychological mechanisms as the basis for a pluralistic approach to memes

**Evolution of Intelligence**:
- Intelligence is the capacity of animals to generate behavioral flexibility through dynamic neural network states
- It evolved to detect causal relations in the world
- The evolution of intelligence marked a shift in behavioral causation from genes and development to neural networks
- This negates the claim of reductionism in any biological account of intelligent animal behavior

**Kitcher's Rule**:
- Kitcher argued that understanding culture requires a serious psychological theory, which must be based on contemporary psychological scientific approaches and concepts.


#### Defining culture: Psychological mechanisms and forms of knowledge in human societies

**Supervisory Attentional System:**
- A high level cognitive mechanism for modulating activities of a contention-scheduling system
- Exists in frontal lobes
- Plays an important role in enculturation and human activities
- May be present in other species, especially great apes

**Distinction between Mechanisms:**
- Some psychological mechanisms involved in ability to enter culture are shared with other species
- Unique human mechanisms essential for the existence of human culture
- Distinction between common and unique mechanisms necessary for understanding their evolution

**Definitions of Culture:**
- Complex phenomenon studied across various disciplines
- Hundreds of definitions in social sciences due to different schools of thought and competing demands
- Pluralism results from complexity and methodological differences
- Kitcher's rule requires a definition compatible with psychological mechanism emphasis and the complexity of culture

**Shared Knowledge and Beliefs:**
- Shared knowledge and beliefs form the basis of common culture
- Current psychological theory does not support one single mechanism for imparting shared knowledge and beliefs
- Different forms of knowledge and belief transmission: imitation, motor traditions, etc.
- Imitation important in human evolution, possibly in language development
- Recent reports suggest imitation is also a form of learning in chimpanzees.


#### Comparing Imitation, Language, and Social Constructions in Culture

**Comparison between Imitation, Language, and Social Constructions**

**Imitation**:
- Concerned with learning a set of actions
- Not exclusively human
- Central role in human culture disputed
- Different developmental trajectory than language and social constructions
- Mechanisms underlying imitation unclear

**Language**:
- Acquired within an environment of other language users
- Not modality-specific but processed in the same brain regions
- Generates virtually unlimited utterances from a finite number of symbols
- Essential feature of every culture
- Variations in social construction of justice exist between cultures
- Invariant is the existence of social constructions in every culture

**Social Constructions**:
- Essential for participating, but mechanisms underlying learning unclear
- Theory of mind mechanism suggested as necessary
- Distinct from imitation and language
- Different developmental trajectory than imitation and language
- Sites in different parts of the brain
- Based on different psychological mechanisms

**Imitation vs. Memetics**:
- Imitation is not the only mechanism for meme transmission
- Different types of memes can be based on various mechanisms
- Copying fidelity, longevity, and fecundity may vary between meme systems

**Errors in Assuming Universal Darwinism Requires High Copying Fidelity**:
- Biological systems like the vertebrate immune system and certain forms of learning have varying copying fidelity
- Memetics can also exhibit similar variations


#### Deep-level memes: Culture, knowledge structures, evolution, and human cognition.

**Understanding Memetics: Scope of Information Transmission**

**Surface Memes:**
- Specific information replicated through daily social interactions (e.g., bargains at a shop)
- Short shelf life and narrow in scope
- Dependent on higher order memories and knowledge structures
- Examples: names of shops, restaurants, or dentists

**Deep-Level Memes:**
- Higher order knowledge structures that provide understanding of the world (e.g., concept of shops)
- Wide information scope but culture-specific
- Acquired through enculturation and not by imitation
- Essential for surface memes existence

**Deep Level Memes vs Surface Memes:**
- Deep level memes are psychological mechanisms, while surface memes are their products
- Both are products of specific evolutionary processes (universal to all humans)
- Resolution of the debate between domain-specific cognitive modules and general process approach in psychology will impact memetics.

**Impact on Understanding Culture:**
- Memetics may provide a fruitful approach to understanding culture by bridging biological and social sciences.
- Naturalizing science of culture: recognizing that cultures are complex entities based on knowledge, beliefs, and values (Bloch, this volume).

**Deep Level Memes and Social Sciences:**
- Social scientists have been studying culture longer than biologists
- Understanding deep level memes requires recognizing the role of knowledge, beliefs, and values in shaping cultures.

**Implications for Memetics:**
- Acceptance by social scientists is not the primary concern in naturalizing science of culture
- Focus should be on understanding meme production through psychological predispositions tuned to specific features of the social world (Hull, this volume).


### CHAPTER 5 Memes through social minds - Rosaria Conte

**Social Cognitive Perspective on Memetics**

**Overview**:
- Study of cognitive requirements for intelligent, limited autonomous agents to engage in social interaction
- Focuses on symbolic mental representations (goals and beliefs), and operations on these representations (reasoning, decision-making)
- Social cognitive process involves social beliefs and goals, and operations on social beliefs and goals (social reasoning)
- Beliefs or goals are considered social when they mention another agent and their mental states

**Approach**:
- Receives growing attention in fields of artificial intelligence (AI), multi-agent systems, and artificial societies
- Aims to model and implement systems that act in a social environment
- Focuses on various mental states (social goals, motivations, obligations) and operations (reasoning, decision-making) necessary for intelligent social systems to influence others through social learning, influence, and control

**Challenges with Traditional Approaches**:
- "Theory of mind" focuses on agents' understanding of others but doesn't explain goal achievement
- Social reinforcement is insufficient: does not account for norm recognition and conflict resolution

**Social Cognitive Approach Advantages**:
- Necessary to explain the mental implementation of social institutions (Micro-Macro link)
- Explains how social or legal norms are observed, violated, and enforced
- Accounts for complex societies with interfering institutions and their corresponding norms
- Enables agents to reason about norms, solve conflicts, and contribute to the evolution of culture

**Memetics and Social Cognition**:
- Memes operate through and across agents' minds, shaping mental processes and capacities
- A memetic mind is a social mind that can recombine, select, and contribute to the evolution of culture (beliefs, customs, rules)
- Social cognitive models provide a foundation for understanding how memes replicate and spread in society.


#### Memetics: Understanding Memetic Agents through Social Cognitive Modeling

**Memetics: Contributions and Challenges**

**Memetics as a Foundational Approach**:
- Examines elemental principles of cultural transmission
- Shares advantages of evolutionary approaches: heuristic, new interpretations, research questions, bridges gaps between incompatible phenomena

**Interdisciplinary Nature of Memetics**:
- Brings together biologists, philosophers, anthropologists, and evolutionary psychologists
- Computational modelling plays a significant role in memetics research

**Interesting Issues Addressed by Memetics**:
- Survival of institutional concepts
- Evolution of financial markets
- Propagation of social pathologies

**Challenges in Memetics: Inadequate Understanding of Memetic Agents**
- Agents viewed as 'vectors' rather than actors behind cultural transmission
- Autonomy property of agents crucial for understanding memetic process
- Decision-making process involved in belief formation not explicitly accounted for

**Mechanisms of Memetic Transmission**:
- Typically explained by imitation, but there are other mechanisms (social learning, goal adoption, etc.)
- Characteristics of these mechanisms affect transmissibility and can be used to make hypotheses

**Problems with Existing Views on Memetic Success**:
- 'Substantialist' views: memes replicate due to their characteristics
- Notions like 'psychological appeal' do not add anything to the account
- Memes' success depends on mechanisms and processes of transmission, rather than content

**Mental Implementation of Memes**:
- Not well-defined in memetic literature: equated to storing or cementation, but requires a cognitive answer


#### Multi-Agent Systems and Social Simulation in Memetics: Autonomous Agents, Beliefs, and Filters.

**Meme Implementation in Minds: MAS and ABSS Contributions**

**Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and Agent-Based Social Simulation (ABSS)**
- Fields contributing to memetics through theoretical and methodological perspectives
- MAS focuses on autonomous, intelligent agents with proactivity, autonomy, and sociability
  * BDI architecture: Beliefs, Desires, Intentions
  * Agents interact in various domains (air traffic control, military defense, robotics)
  * Adaptive and flexible for social interaction
- ABSS simulates social phenomena, particularly the spread of opinions and conventions

**MAS Contributions to Memetics**
- Theoretical: models autonomous agents as software systems with beliefs, desires, intentions
- Methodological: provides agent platforms for observing social phenomena (DESIRE platform)

**Characteristics of Limited Autonomous Agents**
- Self-interested agents with internal criteria to select inputs
- Beliefs and goals filtered through a "double filter architecture"
  * Control over beliefs
    + Epistemic criteria: credibility, non-negotiability
    + Pragmatic criteria: reasons for believing something
  * Beliefs have different statuses based on motivations (superstitious belief to opinion)
  * Variable in certitude, retractability, connectivity, etc.


#### Limited autonomy and belief acceptance: self-interest, commitment, risk-taking, empathy, and social influences impact on memetic processes.

**Beliefs and their Force**
* Beliefs have a "force" or strength
* This force is related to certitude and motives for acceptance (e.g., self-protection, commitment, hypothetical reasoning)
* Pragmatic criteria influence belief acceptance: self-interest, commitment, hypothetical reasoning, communication, empathy, risk-taking, prudence

**Filtering Goals**
* Agents have two fundamental filters for goal generation and processing:
	+ **Self-interested goal generation**: Autonomous agents can generate goals that serve their own interests
	+ **Belief-driven goal processing**: Any modification to an agent's goals requires a change in beliefs
* Social consequences of these filters:
	+ Beliefs are formed and revised through decision-based, selective processes (acceptance)
	+ Decisions may not be conscious or explicit
	+ Agents will not accept beliefs under threat unless there is a benefit
	+ Reasons for belief acceptance affect probability, strength, transmission

**Limited Autonomy of Beliefs and Goals**
* Autonomy is limited at the levels of both beliefs and goals:
	+ Agents are influenced by external inputs (belief filter)
	+ Even minimal adoption can occur when ignoring an input is not possible
* Social dependence, cooperation, norms also limit autonomy
* Agents' liability to influence varies depending on belief type (e.g., social agents are permeable to gossip and rumors)

**Requirements for Memetic Transmission**
* Communication and imitation are not necessary or sufficient properties for memetic processes
	+ Non-communicative transmission possible through passive social influence (empty boxes example)
* Imitation identified as an essential component by Dawkins and Blackmore, but distinction made between replication and reproduction.


#### Memetics and Social Cognitive Capacities: Spreading Memes through Beliefs and Goals

**Memetic Transmission: Beyond Imitation**

**Issues with Imitation as a Model for Memetic Transmission**
- Imitation is a "bad word" in behavioral sciences (Thorndike's definition insufficient)
- Automatic contagion occurs without meme transmission
- Novel behaviors can be copied without imitation
- Importance of social cognitive capacities in memetic processes

**Memes Through (Social) Minds**

**Social Cognitive Capacities for Memetic Agents:**
- Form social beliefs and goals
- Accept inputs from others
- Process mental representations
- Decide whether to accept, discard or modify them

**Utility of Approach in Memetics:**

**Memetic Transmission Mechanisms:**
- Imitation (conformity, norm monitoring, social learning, social facilitation)
- Active social influence (manipulation, persuasion, communication)

**Impact of Beliefs on Transmission:**
- Stronger beliefs increase probability of transmission
- Stronger beliefs have greater impact on recipient

**Memetic Effects of Transmission Mechanisms:**
- Norm-based monitoring: deeper and more stable impact than conformity
- Conformity: stronger behavioral impact than social reinforcement.


#### The role of gossip and normative influence in the social spread of beliefs and behaviors. Reciprocal altruism of beliefs and normative influence as mechanisms for memetic transmission. Examples of social propagation without and with memes. Faster and less durable behavioral propagation vs. deeper and longer-lasting memetic processes. Social cognitive analysis of transmissibility based on acceptance motives and mechanisms.

**Reciprocal Altruism of Beliefs:**
* Mechanism for spreading social norms or collective misbeliefs (false beliefs)
* Successful due to motives of acceptance (prudence) and mechanism of transmission
* Spreads easily and quickly, representing 'reciprocal altruism'
* Evidence from simulation data: Castelfranchi et al. (1998), Saam and Harrer (1999)
* Good guys (norm abiders) outcompeted by cheaters without circulation of information on cheaters
* Faster spread leads to higher payoffs for honest agents in large societies
* Example: vampire bats exhibiting reciprocal altruism within small groups
* Difficulty explaining altruistic behavior in large groups
* Hypothesis: gossip (reciprocal altruism of beliefs) rescues the good guys

**Features of Reciprocation of Beliefs:**
* Cheap form of reciprocation, costs a communicative act
* Pragmatic acceptance without responsibility
* Impersonal source: agents pass it to others without taking responsibility
* Permits individuals to spare costs of direct acquaintance
* Highly efficient and uncontrollable once spread starts
* Plays role in social prejudices, intolerance, discrimination
* Normative influence enhances memetic effect by allowing spread through behavior and social control.

**Transmissibility of Memes:**
* Social cognitive analysis allows hypotheses about transmissibility
* Behavioral propagation without memes: faster and less durable
* Propagation with memes: slower but deeper impact, longer lasting effect
* Memetic processes have different motives of acceptance and mechanisms of transmission, justifying different expectations for transmissibility.


#### Social contagion and memetic influence: Behavioral convergence through emotion expression, social norms, and value activation.

**Behavioral Contagion:**

**Behavioural Convergence through Mutual Influence**:
- Indirect effect of agents' behaviors on and through each other
- Two mechanisms: social learning and social release
- Social release: individuals release previously inhibited behaviors in the presence of others

**Automatic Contagion of Emotion Expression**:
- Spread of behavioral expression of emotions, not limited to memetic process
- Can be explained by social learning or social release theories

**Vulnerable Position Effect**:
- Agents' mutual influence determined by consequences of diverging from perceived regularities
- No meme spreading as no representation of norms updated

**Emotional Sharing**:
- Empathy: passerby shares emotion experienced by victim through inferential process
- Not necessarily an identical format of meme spread

**Socially Based Generation of Beliefs**:
- Witness' negative speculations about life based on social perception, not intentionally induced by victim

**Socially Based Goal-Activation**:
- Agents infer necessities or goals from others' behaviors and may exhibit corresponding actions

**Socially Based Value Activation**:
- Individuals join collective actions based on perceived behaviors of others without conformity to specific beliefs

**The 'Auction Effect'**:
- Goal of reproducing others' behaviors relative to beliefs about what others believe.


#### Comparing behavioral propagation through social minds: memes, stability, fidelity, and adaptability. Examples include black-party domino effect, contagion, suicide, empathy, and auctions. Memetic processes are more stable, autonomous, but less faithful, while non-memetic processes spread quickly, have higher fidelity, but are less autonomous. The comparison is based on mental processes involved in transmission and the agents' social and cognitive competencies.

**Social Influence: Behavioral Propagation**

**Table 5.1 Comparison of Examples:**
- **Black-Party-Domino Contagion**: Fidelity (+), Fecundity (-), Stability/Durability (-), Adjustability (-)
- **Vulnerable Suicide Empathy**: Fidelity (-), Fecundity (+), Stability/Durability (-), Adjustability (-)
- **Weber, Koslovsky Auction**: Fidelity (-), Fecundity (+), Stability/Durability (+), Adjustability (+)
- **Simmel Norm Recognition Effect**: Fidelity (+), Fecundity (+), Stability/Durability (+), Adjustability (+)

**Table 5.2 More Analytical Comparison:**
- **Black-Party-Domino Contagion**: Fidelity (+), Fecundity (-), Stability/Durability (-), Adjustability (-), Speed of Transmission (+), Speed of Extinction (+), Contingency (-), Verticality (-)
- **Vulnerable Suicide Empathy**: Fidelity (-), Fecundity (+), Stability/Durability (-), Adjustability (-), Speed of Transmission (+), Speed of Extinction (-), Contingency (-), Verticality (-)
- **Weber, Koslovsky Auction**: Fidelity (-), Fecundity (+), Stability/Durability (+), Adjustability (+), Speed of Transmission (+), Speed of Extinction (+), Contingency (+), Verticality (+)
- **Simmel Norm Recognition Effect**: Fidelity (+), Fecundity (+), Stability/Durability (+), Adjustability (+), Speed of Transmission (+), Speed of Extinction (-), Contingency (+), Verticality (+)

**Observable Features:**
- **Fidelity**: Regularity or exact reproduction of influence
- **Fecundity**: Indirect influence and range of impact
- **Stability/Durability**: How long the influence lasts over time
- **Adjustability**: Agents' acceptance and modification of received inputs
- **Speed of Transmission**: Speed at which a phenomenon spreads through a population
- **Speed of Extinction**: Rate at which effects cease upon removal of causes
- **Contingency**: Whether the effect is contingent on its cause or autonomous
- **Verticality**: Ability to be conveyed to subsequent generations

**Memetic vs. Non-Memetic Processes:**
- Memetic: Involve modification of agents' minds, require social and cognitive competencies
- Non-Memetic: Do not imply changes in agents' minds, rely on automatic processes

**Table 5.2 Continued:**
| Behavioural Propagation | Fidelity | Fecundity | Stability/Durability | Adjustability | Speed of Transmission | Speed of Extinction | Contingency | Verticality |
|-------------------------|----------|-----------|----------------------|---------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Memetic Processes        | Lower    | Higher    | Higher             | More autonomy  | Slower            | Graceful decline | Autonomous      | Yes          |
| Non-Memetic Processes   | Higher   | Lower     | Lower              | None/poor      | Faster            | Sudden extinction| Contingent    | No          |


#### Memetics and Social Behavior: Cooperation vs Exchange, Memes and Interferences, Cooperative versus Market-oriented Applications of Information Technologies.

**Memetics: Understanding Transmission and Interference Among Memes**

**Characteristics of Mental Transmission:**
- Slower than physical transmission
- Lesser degree of fidelity
- More stable and autonomous behavioral effects

**Memetic Processes:**
- Can interfere with each other: concurrent or cooperative
- Social and mental processes allow detection and prediction of interference

**Example of Interference:**
1. Car flashing as a greeting vs warning
2. Impact on transmission and stability of memes based on interpretation
3. Enforcing legal norms through social control (cooperative process) or neutralizing them with conflicting social norms (concurrent process)

**Norm Interference:**
- Reciprocal altruism of beliefs: cost versus benefit analysis
- Antagonistic vs cooperative memetic processes
- Effects on social behavior and diffusion in society

**The Internet as an Example:**
- Widespread adoption but lack of cooperation applications
- Differences between cooperation and exchange
  - Common goal and interdependence for cooperation
  - Interdependence only for exchange
- Complex process of agreement required for cooperation
- Cheating reduces convenience in cooperative environments

**Advantages of Memetics:**
- Understanding memetic transmission and interference aids in creating effective strategies in information societies
- Hybrid multi-agent systems with human and software agents: potential applications include agent-mediated electronic commerce.

**Further Advantages:**
- Cooperative use of information technologies for more cooperative applications should not be abandoned.


#### Memetics through Social Minds: Limited Autonomous Agents and Memetic Processes

**Meditator or Representative Agent for Electronic Transactions**
- Bargainfinder was an early agent that got banned from CD stores due to its aims not being beneficial to specific stores (Crabtree, 1998:135)
- A **mediator/representative agent** must be accepted by the community it will interact with
- Agent systems for negotiation must be enabled to deal with this problem (Gutmann et al., 1998)

**Software Agents in Electronic Transactions**
- Software agents are expected to:
  - Detect errors and irregularities in contracts
  - Negotiate with partners without providing private information about their users
  - Avoid socially undesirable behavior (e.g., cheating)
- **Norm-abiding and cooperative behavior** is important even in a competitive context like the market
- Agents must determine whether to:
  - Resist external influence or accept it
  - Lie (about reserved price, private information) or not (do not cheat if this diminishes the user's reputation)

**Memetic Agents for Electronic Transactions**
- **Meme**: a symbolic representation of any state of affairs, both internal and external
- **External meme**: directly accessible objects (artefacts, products, behaviors) that incorporate a meme
- **Internal meme (or mental implementation)**: the process which memeticists do not seem to perceive
  - Memes are equated with concepts and memetic agents with recipients and vectors of memes
  - The memetic process is simplified to storing and selecting memes and their associated values
- **Memetic process**: a process by means of which memes replicate
  - Memes propagate through the social minds of agents, thinking to their social competence, and across their minds, meaning from one to another
- **Memetic agent**: a limited autonomous social agent endowed with social competence (including imitation and language)
- **Social competence**: includes the capacity to detect and reason upon others' mental states

**Conclusion**
- The chapter focuses on studying social cognitive processes among limited autonomous agents as essential for understanding cultural change and evolution, specifically memetic processes
- The main issue with memetic theory is the treatment of the **memetic agent** and the conceptualization of the requirements of memetic processes
- A model of a limited autonomous agent is presented that defines the social agent as liable to social influence but endowed with internal criteria and motives for accepting it
- This model can account for investigating the mechanisms of memetic transmission, making hypotheses about their transmissibility, observing, and predicting the effects of memetic processes
- Memetic agents are argued to be limited autonomous agents endowed with a capacity for social action

### CHAPTER 6 The evolution of the meme - Kevin N. Laland and John Odling-Smee

**Understanding Culture: The Evolution of the Meme**

**Background:**
- Tylor's definition of culture (1871) as a complex whole including knowledge, belief, art, morals, customs and capabilities
- Challenges for evolutionary biologists in understanding its evolution
- Memes proposed as units to help elucidate the story

**Qualifications:**
- Plausible but incomplete narrative about culture's evolution
- Not all culture is merely memes; informational and non-informational components exist

**Evolutionary Perspective:**
- Organisms modify environments (niche construction)
- Genes express products that impinge on the environment
- Organisms adapt to and construct their own local environments
- Niche construction modifies selection pressures, leading to evolutionary feedback

**Examples of Niche Construction:**
- Beaver's dam: extends phenotype and alters environment
- Spiders' webs: evolves in response to initial web construction
- Ants' nests: source of selection for various behavior patterns
- Burrow systems or nests in mammals, reptiles, and amphibians

**Meme Evolution:**
- Capacity to modify environments leads to memes as information-gaining processes
- Many animals have memes; human culture evolved from animal protoculture
- Susceptibility of the host and social environment influence meme success.


#### Niche construction: interplay of genetic, ontogenetic, and cultural evolution with ecological inheritance.

**Niche Construction and Evolution:**

**Background:**
- Biologically minded individuals may be surprised by the breadth of niche construction
- Over 34,000 species of spiders construct silken structures for protection or reproduction (Preston-Mafham and Preston-Mafham 1996)
- Over 9000 species of birds build nests (For shaw 1998)
- Over 2000 known species of termites construct complex nests (Holldobler and Wilson 1994; Gullan and Cranston 1994)

**Impact:**
- Niche construction is all-pervasive and can lead to ecological inheritance
- Modified environments create new selection pressures for future generations
- Interaction between natural and niche selection leads to evolutionary consequences: alternative trajectories, new episodes, influence on genetic variation, stability of polymorphic equilibria, time-lags, momentum effects, inertia effects, opposite responses, and sudden catastrophic responses (Feldman & Cavalli-Sforza 1976; Kirkpatrick & Lande 1989; Laland et al. 1996a; Robertson 1991)

**Processes of Knowledge Acquisition:**
- Genetic evolution: population genetics processes that transmit knowledge through genes (Laland et al. 2000)
- Ontogenetic processes: learning, immune system (Szathmáry & Maynard Smith 1995; Laland et al. 2000)
- Culture or protoculture: knowledge acquisition through social learning (Lewontin 1983; Odling-Smee et al. 1996)

**Processes Interaction:**
- Genetic, ontogenetic, and cultural processes work together to provide all organisms with the knowledge underlying their adaptations (Laland et al. 2000)
- Knowledge gained through these processes is expressed in niche construction and selected by environments that are partly niche-constructed.


#### Social learning in animals: Memes and the spread of behaviors through populations.

**Social Learning and the Evolution of the Meme**

**Definition of Social Learning**:
- Animal learns a behavior pattern or acquires a preference through observing or interacting with another animal
- Distinguished from asocial learning, where behavior acquisition is not influenced by interaction with others
- Not limited to imitation; includes processes like local enhancement and goal emulation

**Imitation vs. Social Learning**:
- Imitation requires more complex psychological processing than local enhancement and other social learning processes
- Critical for stable transmission of learned information, but simple mechanisms can also result in social learning traditions
- Imitated action is not perfect the first time, implying some reconstruction of behavior pattern is required

**Examples of Animal Social Learning**:
1. Washing of sweet potatoes by Japanese macaques
2. Infant chimpanzees learning foraging skills from adults
3. Rats acquiring dietary preferences based on cues from conspecifics
4. Spread of milk bottle-top opening in British tits

**Factors Influencing Social Learning**:
1. Historical factors (diet choices dependent on prevalent memes)
2. Exposure to opened milk bottles (meme propagated by local enhancement and other means)

**Significance of Social Learning to the Evolution of the Meme**:
- Social learning underlies many animal traditions, which can be understood as meme complexes
- Humans have evolved further processes, such as language and complex cognition, that facilitate the transmission and elaboration of memes within culture.


#### Niche construction and vertical cultural transmission: Hominid evolution's reliance on self-regulated environments and memes.

**The Evolution of the Meme**

**Milk Bottles as a Niche Construction**:
- Creating opened milk bottles biases the selective environment of memes in other birds to favor the opening of bottles
- This leads to the acquisition of the "meme" (i.e., the behavior of opening milk bottles)

**Social Learning and Cultural Transmission**:
- Humans transmit more information vertically (across generations) than any other species
- Many cultural traits in 277 African societies correlated with linguistic history, suggesting reliance on vertical transmission
- In contrast, most animal social learning involves the short-term transmission of information about foods and predators among unrelated individuals

**Theoretical Models of Cultural Transmission**:
- Adaptive advantages of social learning depend on the rate of environmental change:
  - Slow changes favor population genetics, while variable environments favor asocial learning
  - Intermediate rates of change favor social learning and vertical transmission between parent and offspring

**Niche Construction and Cultural Transmission**:
- The increasing reliance of hominids on vertical cultural transmission is consistent with a niche construction perspective
- Hominid niche construction, heavily reliant on memes, could have favored further vertical transmission and more memes
  - By controlling and regulating the environment, parental transmission of cultural information became advantageous
  - This could lead to an autocatalytic process, with increasing environmental regulation leading to further transmission


#### Exploring Memetic Evolution: Factors Determining Memes' Success and Mathematical Models.

**The Evolution of the Meme**

**Acceleration of Cultural Processes**:
- Post-industrial societies have rapidly changing environments
- Vertically transmitted information may be insufficiently adaptive
- Favoring horizontal and oblique cultural transmissions

**Niche Construction and Memes**:
- Niche construction modifies the environment, feeding back to shape information acquisition
- Transition from animal protoculture to human culture:
  - Shift from horizontal transmission of transient memes
  - To transgenerational transmission of stable memes and accumulative culture
  - Then back to horizontal/oblique transmission in response to accelerating environmental change

**Factors Determining Meme Spread**:
- **Fidelity, fecundity, and longevity**: Intrinsic characteristics of the meme
- **Susceptibility of hosts**: Genotype, development, experience, social environment
- **Cultural selection processes**: Conformity, imitation of successful individuals
- **Infectiousness of the idea**: Attractiveness, visibility, memorability

**Theoretical Models for Memetics**:
- Population genetics models have benefited evolutionary biology
- Similar theoretical population memetic models can aid understanding of cultural evolution
- Existing research includes Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman's work on gene-culture coevolution.


#### This passage discusses the evolution of memes through cultural and gene interactions, using the example of lactose absorption and dairy farming.

**Meme Evolution: Coevolution of Meme-Gene Interaction**

**Background:**
- Meme evolution can be studied through formal theoretical work at the cultural level or through meme-gene interaction
- Example: Lactose absorption and dairy farming coevolution

**Lactose Absorption and Dairy Farming Coevolution:**
- Most adult humans are lactose malabsorbers (lack sufficient lactase activity)
- Genetic differences responsible for absorption vs. malabsorption
- Correlation between incidence of lactose absorption and history of dairy farming in populations
- Agricultural niche construction may have favored the genes for absorption

**Theoretical Analysis:**
- Feldman and Cavalli-Sforza's investigation using gene-culture coevolutionary theory
- Defining genotypes based on ability to process lactose
- Individuals having a meme for milk consumption or not
- Population genetics model exploring dairy farming and milk use's impact on lactose absorption spread

**Consequences:**
- Accounts for the spread of lactose absorption
- Explains culturally related variability in its incidence
- Meme transmission complicates selection process, potentially differing from genetic transmission expectations

**Meme Theory and References:**
- Respectable formal theory of memetics: cultural evolutionary and gene-culture coevolutionary theory (Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman 1981; Boyd & Richerson 1985; Feldman & Laland 1996)
- Understanding human culture's ideational, behavioral, and material components through niche construction aids an evolutionary perspective.


### CHAPTER 7 Memes Universal acid or a better mousetrap - Robert Boyd and Peter J. Richerson

**CHAPTER 7: Memes - Universal Acid or a Better Mousetrap?**

**Background:**
- Robert Boyd and Peter J. Richerson's argument for population thinking in understanding cultural evolution
- Comparison of Darwin's ideas with cultural evolution

**Darwin's Contributions:**
1. Natural selection: powerful idea leading to adaptations through efficient replication
2. Population thinking: fundamental contribution to biology, accounting for species evolution
3. Population thinking as key to conceptualizing culture

**Cultural Evolution:**
1. Persistent cultural variation among human groups
2. Culture is information stored in human brains (memes)
3. Cultural information derived from previous generation
4. Understanding cultural transmission: unanswered empirical question

**Population Thinking and Human Sciences:**
- Connects behavior models with data and insights of cultural sciences
- Useful for solving outstanding problems in social sciences
- Mathematical theory building, capturing culture's role in human affairs

**Cultural Differences:**
1. Persistent differences between human groups: not genetic or environmental
2. Examples from Salamon's research on immigrant communities in the US
  - Freiburg: German-Catholic immigrants value farming as a way of life, pressure on children to become farmers
  - Libertyville: Farming seen as profit-making business, individual decision for children regarding farming career

**Arguments for Population Thinking:**
1. Logical necessity for natural, causal theory of culture
2. Usefulness in connecting rich models of behavior from various disciplines with cultural data and insights
3. Building a mathematical theory capturing the role of culture in human affairs.


#### **Culture as Heritable Information: The Role of Memes and Genes**

**Farming Practices Differences Between Freiburg and Libertyville**
* Families influence children's farming entry but values differ:
  * Freiburg families support farming, lower education emphasis
  * Libertyville families encourage higher education, rent more land for larger farms (mean size: 518 acres vs. 276 acres)
* Grain production dominates in Libertyville (primary source of income), while mixed agriculture prevalent in Freiburg (dairying and livestock-raising)
* German farmers in Freiburg accommodate families on limited acreage through animal husbandry, unlike Yankee farmers in Libertyville.

**The Importance of Cultural Information**
* Every culture contains vast amounts of information that must be encoded in material objects due to lack of widespread literacy
* Human brains and genes serve as primary means for storing cultural information
* Artifacts have limited capacity to store culture: difficult reverse-engineering and semantic knowledge storage.

**Innate vs. Transmitted Cultural Information**
* Most human culture is not stored in human genes but shaped by environmental cues (Pascal Boyer's argument)
* Fang beliefs about ghosts serve as an example of innate, genetically transmitted cultural information
* The adaptive complexity we see in cultures around the world stems from this innate psychology that develops through learning.

**The Role of Culture in Adaptation**
* Cumulative adaptation cannot be based solely on innate, genetically encoded information; transmitted cultural information is crucial for the gradual assembly of adaptations over generations.
* Mariners' magnetic compass evolution: Chinese geomancers noticed magnetite objects orienting in Earth’s magnetic field, leading to technological advancements.


#### The history of compass invention and cultural transmission in animals: hunter-gatherer skills vs. protoculture

**Chinese Compass Development:**
* Chinese mariners used magnetized needles on water for direction at sea
* Developed dry compasses with vertical pin-bearings (ancestor of modern toy compasses)
* Europeans adopted this type of compass in late medieval period
* Transferred knowledge of fixed card compasses, allowing accurate course steering
* Compass makers later improved technology: adjusted iron balls, gimbaled compasses, filled with liquid to damp ship motion

**Evolutionary Psychology:**
* Human psychology built on complex, information-rich evolved modules
* Adapted for hunting and gathering life
* Learning language or understanding emotions comes naturally
* Inventing complex modern artifacts like the compass is challenging
* Hunting and gathering skills not as easily learned as language or social norms

**Survival in Extreme Environments:**
* Stranded in desert environment without modern technology: El Camino del Diabolo (Devil's Road)
* Comparatively well-known route with some success stories but many failures
* Papago Indians lived and raised children in same area for centuries, using traditional knowledge and institutions
* Traditional Papago knowledge essential for survival compared to relying on innate abilities.

**Protoculture in Animals:**
* Social learning occurs in various species: baboons, sparrows, lizards, fish (examples of protocultural variation)
* Observational learning, local enhancement, and other mechanisms transmit behaviors without observational learning
* Food preferences socially transmitted in rats but do not lead to complex new behaviors.

**Cumulative Cultural Change:**
* Genetically stored and transmitted information essential for protocultural differences in animals
* Observational learning important for cumulative cultural change in humans.


#### Cultural evolution and observational learning: Darwinian transmission of information between populations

**Observational Learning and Cultural Evolution**

**Observational Learning**:
- Similar to local enhancement in leading to persistent behavioral differences among populations
- Allows for cumulative cultural change
- Innovations can be incorporated into others' behavioral repertoires through observational learning
- Requires special psychological mechanisms, not just intelligence and social life

**Cultural Transmission**:
- Descendants of a population may have similarities and differences from their ancestors
- Differences can arise due to:
  - Rare usages or forms becoming common
  - New behaviors being present due to borrowing or innovation
- Cumulative cultural change requires observational learning

**Observational Learning Process**:
- People observe the behavior of others and acquire the information to produce a similar behavior
- Individuals are only exposed to a sample of their population's culture
- Cultural samples can be small or immense
- Some individuals may be disproportionately influenced by charismatic leaders or experts

**Cultural Change**:
- Continuity arises from necessary information being transmitted without significant change
- Differences occur due to some variants becoming more common, others more rare, and new variants being introduced
- Understanding population processes is needed to account for both continuity and change.


#### Cultural evolution: Genes vs. memes - replicators and transmission of speech sounds

**Culturally Transmitted Skills and Beliefs: Not Necessarily Replicators**

**Replicators**:
- Things that produce copies of themselves
- Have properties of fidelity, fecundity, and longevity
- Genes are examples of replicators

**Beliefs and Skills as Replicators**:
- Beliefs and ideas can be copied and transmitted, spreading through a population
- However, they are not copied intact from one mind to another
- Information is generated by behavior, then observed and recreated in another brain
- No guarantee the information in the second brain is identical to the first

**Potential Differences**:
- Genetic, cultural, or developmental differences may cause people to infer different beliefs from the same overt behavior
- Replicator model captures only part of cultural evolution

**Generative Model of Linguistic Change**:
- Individual pronunciation is governed by a complex set of rules
- Children induce simplest rules that account for what they hear, which may differ from adults' rules
- Changes in pronunciation occur through rule addition, allowing further changes not possible under old rules

**Replicators Not Necessary**:
- Cumulative adaptive evolution can occur without replicators
- Vocal tract geometry determines speech sounds, varying between individuals
- Long-lived linguistic variations demonstrate this


#### Darwinian evolution of cultural systems: memes as heritable variation and replicatorless imitation.

**Cultural Evolution: Replicators vs. Imitation**

**Phonological System Evolution**:
- Children exposed to adult pronunciations vary their own speech based on average of adults
- Rules not transferred from one brain to another, but system can still evolve through averaging and recombination
- Averaging may prevent high noise levels by maintaining population stability

**Other Models of Cultural Transmission**:
- **Imitation of common type in population**: With high rates of individual learning, creates heritable group differences
- **Social institutions evolution**: No individual-level cultural transmission, but persistent heritable group-level variation

**Darwinian Models of Culture**:
- Ideas can carry cultural information to create complex patterns that differentiate human groups
- Do not need to be closely analogous to genes
- Must exhibit properties of fidelity, fecundity, and longevity

**Memes: Universal Acid or Better Mousetrap?**:
- Uncertainties in understanding cultural storage and transmission
- Importance of studying population properties of cultural information for human cognitive psychology
- Question of whether children choose single model or average attributes when copying cultural behaviors
- Social scientists' reactions to Darwinian models: fear/contempt from disciplines, enthusiasm from evolutionists

**Bridging the Gap**:
- Darwinian models incorporate both individual and cultural perspectives within a single framework
- Population-based models can investigate population-wide consequences of individual interactions with culture and social institutions.


### CHAPTER 8 An objection to the memetic approach to culture - Dan Sperber

**Memetics Approach to Culture: An Objection**

**Background:**
- Memetics is an evolutionary approach to studying culture based on the claim that it is made of memes
- Memes are cultural replicators propagated through imitation and undergoing selection
- Dawkins' definition of memes as non-biological replicators is interesting, but not necessarily true

**Arguments For Memetics:**
- Non-biological replicators are theoretically possible
- Chain letters serve as an example of actual memes that benefit their own propagation
- Many cultural items, such as religious ideas or folktales, can be seen as comparable to chain letters
- Culture is full of items that get copied and propagated, with successful ones having a longer impact

**Objection:**
- Most cultural items are "reproduced", but not copied from one another in the strict sense
- The mutational element in every copying event makes it difficult for selection to work effectively

**Dawkins' Response:**
- The copying process of memes is less precise than that of genes
- Memes may partially blend with each other, leading to a Lamarckian causal arrow from phenotype to replicator
- The main value of the meme analogy lies in sharpening our perception of genetic natural selection

**Mutational Element and Selection:**
- The mutational element in every copying event makes it difficult for selection to work effectively
- Dawkins' thought experiment demonstrates that a drift can occur, with no stable pattern being maintained
- However, this issue is relative to the selection bias for each item, which allows for a higher mutation rate if there is sufficient bias.


#### Discussion on Dawkins' memetic approach to culture: Laughter as a non-meme example and conditions for true replication.

**Objection to Meme Approach to Culture**

**Stability of Cultural Patterns**:
- A judge can accurately order the ten drawings based on their similarities, even if the fidelity of copying is low
- The stable pattern across versions is more likely to endure than individual variations

**Difference Between Experiments**:
- In the first experiment (Figure 8.1), people form a mental image and reproduce it with potential errors or losses of information
- In the second experiment (Figure 8.2), people recognize and reproduce the same type of drawing, with potential variations but no loss of information

**Dawkins' Argument**:
- The "self-normalizing" nature of the instructions means individual variations are phenotypic, not genotypic, and do not compromise the stability of cultural patterns
- This stability is similar to genetic inheritance and provides evidence that memes can be considered replicators

**Counterargument**:
- The author argues that the proposed "test" for meme replication (presenting items in random order) does not necessarily indicate replication
- Laughter is a social behavior influenced by cultural factors, but it is not copied or inherited from others, so it cannot be considered a meme

**Minimal Conditions for True Replication**:
1. B must be caused by A (together with background conditions)
2. B must be similar in relevant respects to A
3. The process that generates B must obtain the information making B similar to A from A


#### Understanding the difference between imitation and instruction inference during memorization tasks

**Causal Chains and Replications**

**Case 1:**
- Participants rely on general perceptual, memory, and motor abilities to memorize and reproduce Figure 8.1 (a Chinese junk drawing)
- Ability to perform poorly in this task
- No copying takes place, only triggering

**Case 2:**
- Stimulus recognized as a token of a general type: five-branched star
- Participants produce another token of the same recognizable type when asked to reproduce it
- Ability to perform well in this task is not an ability to perceive and copy
- Recognition involves attributing goals and intentions

**Dawkins' Thought Experiment:**
- Comparison of two tasks: reproducing a Chinese junk drawing or making an origami junk after being taught by demonstration
- Inferring instructions from demonstration is not 'self-normalizing'
- Instructions are informed by what is observed and what is already known
- Normalization results from the fact that something other than copying is taking place

**Language Acquisition:**
- Child internalizes grammar and lexicon based on linguistic interactions
- Grammar not present in data to be copied, must be inferred
- Acquiring meaning goes beyond the information provided
- Imitation may play a role in acquiring phonology but not in acquiring meaning.


### CHAPTER 9 If memes are the answer what is the question - Adam Kuper

**Chapter 9: Understanding Culture Through Memes**

**Adam Kuper's Perspective**
- Questions the relationship between memes and culture as an answer to the uniqueness of human beings
- Culture is a complex concept, often used in different ways

**Dawkins and Tylor on Culture**
- Dawkins refers to culture as a "snobbish sense" but doesn't clarify its scientific meaning
- Tylor defines culture as the sum of customs and skills transmitted by society, not just high art or spiritual values

**Origins of the Concept of Culture**
- Arnold: Culture distinguished the elite from the masses
- Darwin: Culture marked the difference between humans and other primates
- Tylor: Culture was shared by all people, constantly advancing

**French vs. German Traditions in Anthropology**
- French: Civilization as a progressive, universal achievement (science and technology)
- German: A culture is the heritage of a particular community (religion, language, arts)

**Modern Anthropological Views on Culture**
- One camp: Culture as a machine for living, set of tools for exploiting nature (evolutionist/scientific)
- Another camp: Culture as a system of ideas and values, expressed in symbols (relativism)

**Dawkins' Ideas on Culture: A Victorian Evolutionist Perspective**
- Human culture is based on knowledge of nature, control of nature, and moral rules
- Progressive development with some nations/peoples leading the way
- Measure of progress is faith in science vs. belief in religion or magic

**Criticisms Against Dawkins' Model**
- Anthropological debates on this topic but not elaborated here.


#### Critique of memes in cultural evolution: Difficulties with Dawkins' theories and anthropological perspective on religious beliefs.

**Critique of Diffusionism and Evolutionism in Anthropology**

**Diffusionism**:
- People in a geographical region shared many ideas and customs despite different levels of evolution
- Improved techniques and practices were introduced through borrowing rather than independent development
- People often changed as a result of conquest or foreign invasion

**Challenges to Evolutionism**:
- Modern societies may not be in general rational or scientific, despite advances in science and technology
- Advances in science and technology do not necessarily undermine religious ideas within a society
- Measures of progress in fields like morality, art, and kinship organization are difficult to agree on

**Critique of Memes as an Answer**:
- **Dawkins' treatment of cultural theories**: taken for granted that the facts about human culture are straightforward
- Example: suggestion of a "meme for suicide" based on a novel, not supported by serious analytical accounts
- Lack of evidence to support conclusions about the persistence of certain memes (e.g., belief in God)

**Complexity of Ideas and Institutions**:
- Cultural traits are not particulate; ideas about gods are linked to other cosmological and institutional ideas
- Ideas about gods operate within an intricate network of relationships between people, things, places, symbols, and other ideas
- The power of ideas and practices depends often on their setting and the network they are part of

**Example: King's College Founder's Day**:
- Anthropologist Edmund Leach discovered that the central ritual had no master program, and nobody knew the whole ritual


#### The debate on memes as cultural units and their relationship with genes in the context of human evolution, Dawkins vs human sociobiology.

**The College Ritual: A Complex Performance**
- The college porters knew certain things to be done
- Older fellows were expert in specific parts of the performance
- The chaplain could be relied upon to do his bit, as could the choirmaster and chef
- No single program or authority for the ritual
- Complex performance may not express a single message or embody straightforward idea

**Investigating the Ritual: An Ethnographic Study**
- Leach considered making an ethnographic study of the ritual
- Warned by college fellows to keep the ritual a mystery
- Possible that the mutual dependence of various constituencies required recognition of one another's roles

**Culture Traits and Meme Theory**
- Culture versus genes: memes designed to torpedo human sociobiology
- Dawkins argued humans are unique due to culture, not just genes
- Memes act as gene analogies, pushing genes into the shadows
- Human beings are unique because of ideas, ideals, consciousness, and reason
- Free will allows rejection of errant memes, including religious ideas

**Biology and Cultural Evolution: The Quest for a Theory**
- Dawkins believes biology can provide a theory for cultural evolution
- Repudiates human sociobiology but still sees value in biological theory
- Lamarckian theory proposed as an alternative to genetic determinism of culture
- Meme theory offered as neo-Darwinian approach to cultural evolution.


#### Exploring cultural evolution through genetic analogies and their limitations

**Darwinizing Culture: The Gene-Meme Analogy**

**Introduction:**
- Richard Dawkins' comparison of cultural transmission to genetic transmission (The Selfish Gene)
- Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman's analogy between the two processes
- Metaphors as useful aid for clear thinking but with potential dangers

**Analogies Between Cultural and Genetic Transmission:**
- Reproduction and mutation in cultural transmission (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman)
- Gene-meme analogy: memes as the cultural equivalent of genes
- Borrowing concepts from Darwinian biology to analyze problems (Boyd & Richerson)

**Difficulties with the Gene-Meme Analogy:**
- Risk of treating metaphor as a homology
- Memes acquiring solidity by virtue of their relationship with genes
- Debate on the material identity and existence of genes (Dawkins vs. some geneticists)

**Evolutionary Approaches to Culture:**
- Questions regarding what is meant by culture and evolution
- Open, eclectic, and multi-faceted approach to Darwinian program in human sciences.

**Conclusion:**
- Comparison of cultural and genetic transmission through metaphors can be useful but requires caution
- The existence of memes may be in doubt or metaphorical, like the gene
- Evolutionary approaches to culture should be diverse and inclusive.


### CHAPTER 10 A well-disposed social anthropologists problems with memes - Maurice Bloch

**Anthropologist's Perspective on Memes**

**Memes as Teaching Devices**:
- Provide a clear and imagination-stimulating concept for beginners
- Help understand what makes human culture different from genetically driven behavior
- Bypass the trap of making culture seem transcendental, mysterious, and immaterial
- Avoid the pitfalls of sociobiology and dualistic philosophy/social science

**Dawkins' Approach to Memes**:
- Attempts to present biologists and social scientists as dealing with different parts of a unitary phenomenon
- Highlights the need for congruent theories between the two disciplines
- Aims to further dialogue on this type of general enterprise

**Challenges in Anthropology and Memetics**:
- Previous attempts at collaboration between natural and social scientists have often failed due to misunderstandings
- Anthropologists are skeptical of "meme theory" due to fears of legitimizing racism and sexism
- Memeticists may not fully understand the work of anthropologists, leading to misinterpretations

**Anthropologist's Concept of Culture**:
- Similar to the idea of memes in terms of independent reproduction and transmission
- Anthropologists have previously characterized culture as "superorganic" or "the supernatural"
- Memetics can help guard against implicit dualisms that arise from these characterizations

**Misrepresentations of Anthropology**:
- Detractors often go back to examples of extreme relativism, which are commonly misrepresented
- Ignore the majority of anthropological work that does not support their argument
- Memeticists should be more aware of anthropological findings and perspectives


#### **Analyzing Culture as Discrete Memes:**

**The Problem of Memes in Anthropology**

**Background:**
- Social scientist's analogy: studying photosynthesis vs human brain evolution
- Emphasizing the significance of the evolution of human brain for information replication is valuable
- Memetic theory as a new way to discuss culture, but lack of acknowledgment in anthropology

**Importance of Memes:**
- Similarity between memes and genes: both replicate and follow Darwinian algorithm
- Necessity of distinct units for evolutionary synthesis
- Memetics implies human culture is made up of discrete bits (memes)

**Challenges with Memetic Theory:**
- Difficulty in defining the analytical isolation of memes
- Culture cannot be a continuous entity; must consist of discrete units
- Memes form clusters and associations, but boundaries are arbitrary
- Coherence of culture: a longstanding controversy in anthropology

**Issues with Memetic Theory:**
- Difficulty defining the nature and boundaries of memes
- Examples of candidate memes lack clear definition (tunes, folk tales, taboos)
- Traditional farmer's knowledge: impossible to divide into discrete bits
- Arbitrary memeplexes and the coherence of culture.


#### Critique of Cultural Evolutionism and Diffusionism: Consistency Criticisms in Anthropology

**Anthropology and Evolutionism:**
* Anthropology emerged at end of 19th century as discipline to fill gap between Homo sapiens and writing
* Early anthropologists believed history was a series of stages, often characterized by technology
* Difficulties with this approach: modern hunters and gatherers not identical to ancestors; technological knowledge diffusion; time elapsed since emergence of Homo sapiens is same for all groups

**Anthropological Evolutionism Criticisms:**
* Culture seen as governed by an evolutionary process (diffusionists) was criticized for the following reasons:

**Consistency Criticisms:**
1. **American version**: stressed cultures form consistent wholes, every element moulded to fit in with others due to psychological need for integration; culture not understood as governed by an evolutionary process
2. **British social structural approach**: mental attitudes and beliefs are not separate from the ordered cooperation required in living society, coherence of mental beliefs reflects greater need for coordination

**Impact on Memetics:**
* Diffusionists emphasized transmission of isolated units which is also a key concept in memetics
* Criticisms of diffusionism led to understanding that even adopted traits become part of the culture pattern and undergo modification during assimilation.


#### Anthropological critiques of cultural determinism: Culture as socially embedded knowledge, not a collection of bits or memes.

**Cultural Anthropology: The Nature of Culture**

**Background:**
- Discussion on the nature of culture and its impact on individuals and societies
- Emphasis on coherence and transmission

**Position 1: Irrelevance of Trait Origin**
- Ultimately irrelevant to explain why a trait is adopted by an individual or culture
- Any borrowed trait modified to fit context
- Example of noodles in Italy from China (meaning different)

**Levi-Strauss' Structuralism:**
- Coherence originates from psychological necessity for order
- Specific types of structures: tree structures, binary oppositions
- Generative process leading to new forms

**Sperber's Perspective:**
- Transmission and communication distinct from mental representations
- Private mental process in creating meaning (not historical)

**British Social Anthropology:**
- Emphasis on social aspect of human life over cultural
- Suspicious of the idea of culture as a vast encyclopedia
- Knowledge is implicit, related to practices and context
- Culture exists on many levels, learnt in various ways (implicit or explicit)

**Consistency Criticism:**
- Transmission of culture: not passing on 'bits of culture' but establishing links for re-creation by the receiver.

**American vs British Approaches:**
- Americans focus on consistency and pattern, British emphasize social aspects and practical context.

**Impact on Understanding Culture:**
- Culture is complex, exists on multiple levels, and cannot be understood as a collection of propositions or 'bits of information'.


### CHAPTER 11 Conclusion - Robert Aunger

**Meme Research: Conclusion**

**Chapter Overview**: Discussing the potential of memetics as a foundation for cultural diversification and evolution research. No definitive statement made on future, instead exploring issues from various academic perspectives.

**Evolutionary Theory**:
- Memetics originated in evolutionary biology with Richard Dawkins' work
- Meme replicator analogy to genes raises questions about existence and scientific study of memes

**Explaining Cultural Similarity**:
- Standard explanations for cultural similarity: transmission, genes, individual learning (memetics is associated with transmission)
- Memeticists aim to prove non-genetic inheritance of information in culture
- Eliminating alternatives: genes or individual learning not sufficient explanations
- Niche construction and ecological inheritance as possible alternative explanation for cultural similarity.

**Implications**:
- Memetics could help explain rapid accumulation of human knowledge beyond genetic origins
- Artefacts, tools, and built environment may influence cultural groups through ecological inheritance
- Brains' ability to manipulate information stored in long-term environmental influences can account for similarity within and differences between cultures.


#### Debating the role of memes as cultural replicators in human evolution: indirect evidence and artefacts as memes.

**Memetic Hypothesis and Indirect Evidence**
- Memes exist if indirect or direct evidence is provided
- Indirect evidence: observing directionality in cultural change not explainable by human goal-directed activity
- Memes commonly invoked to explain maladaptive cultural traits, irrational behaviors, and viruses

**The Role of Memes in Human Evolution**
- Memes contribute to gene-meme cooperation leading to niche expansion through mutualism
- Symbiotic relationship between genes and memes results in human ability to dominate planet
- Rapid increase in technological improvements associated with civilization as evidence for meme existence

**Artefacts as Memes**
- Artefacts can be considered memes if they meet the criteria of causal efficacy, similarity, and inheritance
- Replication occurs when information is copied from source to recipient without human involvement (e.g., web pages, photocopies)
- People are only needed to catalyze the process, with no need for mental rule adoption in brains
- From replicating artefact's perspective, these substances become the focus of replication stories rather than aids for information transfer between brains.


#### Meme hypothesis for cultural evolution: Direct evidence needed for replication through social learning

**Memeticists and Memes**
- Memeticists have invoked mental memes to explain technology's evolution (Blackmore, 1999)
- However, technological replication is now suggested without a necessary role for mental replicators
- The "best" evidence for memes - modern technology's evolution - is an instance of replication from another perspective, not supporting the brain-to-brain replication hypothesis
- Technological replication falls under niche construction (Laland & Odling-Smee's ecological inheritance)
- The large human brain's evolution, supposedly explained by memes inciting a bigger home, is unnecessary for this process to occur and must be due to other causes
- Replication occurring in various forms: inside cells (genes), between proteins (prions), and in the environment (artefactual replication)

**Meme Hypothesis and Direct Evidence**
- Memes are replicators defined by their means of replication, distinct from other replicators like artefacts
- Direct evidence of memes-in-minds is necessary to prove the meme hypothesis for explaining culture
- A mechanism of replication that generates similarity between people's beliefs and values can distinguish inheri tance through transmission from alternatives like genetic or developmentalist explanations
- Blackmore's "existence proof" for memes based on dictionary definition is unacceptable as it doesn't provide a specified mechanism of replication

**Uncertainty about the Nature of Memes and Future Directions**
- Identifying a physical model of meme replication is necessary to establish memetics as a distinct field within general selection theory
- Premature to make distinctions among memes without a solid understanding of how encapsulated information processing algorithms interact with mental architecture (Plotkin's "surface-" and "deep-level" memes, Atran's "core" and "developing" memes)


#### Memetics: Replicators and interactors in cultural evolution; Communication problem and information loss.

**Establishing Memes as Mental Entities**
- Need to establish existence of memes as mental entities before dividing them into species (Aunger 1998)

**Communication Problem in Memetics**
- Brain-to-brain transmission involves translation from brain language to signal language, and back again
- Crucial for understanding the functioning of memes in cultural evolution

**Replicator vs. Interactor Distinction**
- Genetic system's distinction generalized as replicator/interactor by Dawkins and Hull (see Introduction)
- Replicators and interactors have different roles: storing information vs. survivor/transmitter, respectively
- Memeticists need to develop a notion of memetic interactor or 'phemotype' for proper understanding

**Identifying Memetic Interactor**
- Difficulty in establishing clear criterion that identifies it as distinct from memetic replicator (replicator/interactor distinction)
- Hull's proposal: relative difficulty of reconstituting the replicator from an interactor
- Quandary if using information loss as defining criterion for interactors due to lack of understanding of memetic information

**Memetic Replication and Information Loss**
- Translation stages in memetic life cycle involve potential loss of information through social communication (Sperber)
- High mutation rate can be a problem if reconstitution of intended meaning is required for proper transmission

**Psychological Normalization and Memetics**
- Brains need to normalize memetic inputs to keep from being swamped with bad information or duped into incorrect behaviors
- This normalizing inferential machine ensures the replication of memetic material during social transmission, but its operation is unlikely to be perfect.


#### Discussing memetics and its relationship with psychology, imitation, and brain complexity in cultural evolution. The importance of understanding psychological mechanisms for memetic transmission and survival. Controversy over the definition and necessity of imitation in memetics.

**Memetics: Similarity of Information Between Individuals**

**Causes of Cultural Similarity**
- Structured inferential processing by the brain (Sperber)
- Result of evolutionary psychology, not memetics
- Differing population dynamics due to mutation rates and types of selection

**Memetics as an Inheritance Process**
- Fundamental problem: different causes than memetics
- Memetics confers an evolutionary advantage through efficient transmission
- Error correction an important aspect in genetic inheritance

**Psychology and Memetics**
- Must address psychological aspects for a complete understanding
- Memetics cannot ignore what happens inside the brain (Conte, Sperber & Plotkin)
- Debate on whether memetics can proceed without clear idea of brain processing
- Important to understand how we learn cultural competencies

**Imitation and Memetics**
- Questions related to imitation in memetics
- Disagreement on the psychological mechanisms involved in imitation
- Blackmore's position: memetics should be restricted to imitative behavior
- Counter-proposals from psychological fraternity (Laland & Odling-Smee, Plotkin, Conte)
- Memetics is not limited to imitation as it may involve other mechanisms.


#### Expanding Memetics: Culture, Artefacts, and Mental Darwinism

**Memetics: Imitation vs. Social Learning**

**Imitation vs. Social Learning**:
- Directly modeling behavior of others may not be more efficient than independent learning
- Basing meme replication on imitation alone is problematic
    - Imitation is too vague to explain the processes involved in social transmission
    - Suggests a "magical elision" of mental substance from one brain to another

**Expanding the Concept of Social Learning**:
- Reader and Laland argue that imitation alone is not sufficient for memetic transmission
    - Example of milk bottle-top opening by birds cannot be explained by imitation alone
        - Birds learn this skill through "stimulus enhancement" rather than observing others
- This implies memes can be learned through any social mechanism, not just imitation
    - Memetics must address the issue of **artefact production**

**Artefacts and Memetic Replication**:
- Artefacts (e.g., written messages) can serve as "communicative artefacts"
    - Artefacts "lay dormant" in the environment, waiting to infect new hosts
    - Words printed on paper can act as a catalyst for memetic replication
- Communicative artefacts represent a junction point for two replication processes:
    - Reproducing the artefact itself
    - Producing new meme copies

**Mental Darwinism**:
- Controversy over whether the memetic dynamic can be extended into the brain
    - Blackmore argues that individual learning should not be considered part of the memetic process
    - Extending the Darwinian process into the brain (Mental Darwinism) may be crucial
        - Allows understanding of transmission mechanisms like imitation
        - Avoids confusion with Lamarckian-style thinking


#### Critique of memetics in social sciences: Debate between Darwinists and Intentionalists

**The Divide Between Mental Darwinists and Intentionalists**
- **Great divide**: separates Mental Darwinists from Intentionalists
- **Mental Darwinists**: motivated by evolutionary thinking, argue no need for engagement with meaning in understanding memetic processes
- **Intentionalists**: psychologists or social scientists who see the need to address issues of meaning in describing human social activity
- Concerns about selectionist psychology: abandonment of intentionality and free will, giving the appearance that all human psychology is random behavioral choices

**Sperber's Perspective on Information Transmission and Intentionalism**
- Agrees with Conte that distinguishing motivation behind information transmission is crucial
- Clear need for causal mechanisms to get information from point A to B
- Unclear whether this necessitates a turn towards intentionalism or the 'intentional stance' (assigning beliefs and values as mental states)
- Possible that such language is necessary but grounded in a Darwinian selection machine at the implementation level

**Criticisms of Memetics by Social Anthropologists**
- **Pessimistic view**: memetics is a promise with no real results or contributions to the explanation of society
- Belief that a quasi-epidemiological approach similar to memetics is already in widespread use in social sciences, with a long but undistinguished history
- Concerns about the central claim: whether there is a novel representative-based process underlying population-level dynamics in culture change
- Perceived problem of circularity: memeticists only study things likely to follow a memetic process, leading to self-congratulation and misunderstanding of more fundamental components of culture
- Criticism of the 'meme' concept: similarities to 'gene', producing a 'revulsion factor' among social scientists
- Memetics seen as an arrogant attempt to explain human social life with a limited toolkit, when many theoretical alternatives are already available
- Fear that memetics may preempt the social sciences by reducing all social processes to selection and transmission.


#### The complexity of culture and the debate over individual vs. societal agency in cultural change. The question of memes as units of transmission and their causal efficacy. Memetics' role in studying information transmission, but limitations in explaining cultural change. The need for a multi-level approach to understanding cultural inheritance.

**Confusions about Culture:**
- Memetics as a critique of culture: social scientists admit they lack alternative account for cultural change (Dawkins, 1976)
- Complexity of culture as a psychological construct and set of practices/institutions
- Difficulty in pinning down definitions of culture among anthropologists
- Concerns about the autonomy of agency: individual or group (Holy & Stulchik, 1983)
- Memetics suggested as new level of agency at informational components level
- Implicit dualism in agency debate and memetics: individuals as independent agents vs. societal determination
- Likelihood of a more complex understanding with coexistence of individual learning from natural environment and social learning (Laland & Odling-Smee)

**Culture:**
- Distributed knowledge that requires social transmission through populations
- Complex tangle of beliefs, behaviors, social institutions, psychological predispositions, emotions
- No reduction admitted due to complexity
- Question of how ideational components underlie behavioral commonalities in culture
- Transmission process: foundation for memetics (Sperber)
- Influence of acquired units of knowledge on likelihood of further transmission: memes?
- Debate about location of agency: individual or group (Durkheim, Rosenberg)
- Implications for understanding mutual constraint relations between individual, societal and cultural replicator levels within an evolutionary framework.


#### Discussion on the future of memetics in cultural studies with focus on empirical research and applications.

**Memetics: An Evolutionary Approach to Culture**

**Overview**:
- Memes are a proposed unit of cultural transmission and evolution
- Debate among researchers on the usefulness of memes in explaining culture
- Barriers to communication between disciplines (biology vs social sciences)
- Variation in academic backgrounds and perspectives contributes to resistance to memetics

**Memetics vs Evolutionary Cultural Studies**:
- Memetics may be a more general approach to understanding cultural evolution than just the "meme idea" itself
- Lack of "applied memetics" studies hinders progress
- Need for specific methodologies and discussion of existing studies within the purview of memetics

**Future Directions for Memetics**:
- Empirical research in memetics may be challenging due to complexity of process being investigated
- Focus on identifying selective agents and understanding evolutionary dynamics rather than estimating transmission strengths
- Ultimate test for memetics: producing novel predictions or insights from existing results
