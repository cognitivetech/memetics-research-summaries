### Mimesis, scapegoat mechanism, and violence in literature and human relations: Girard's career evolution.

**René Girard's Early Works and Career Developments:**
* Deceit, Desire, and the Novel (1961) & Dostoyevsky: du double à l'unité (1965): initial literary focus on desire, mimetic desire, and analysis of Cervantes, Stendhal, Flaubert, Proust, and Dostoyevsky.
* Rejection of intellectual retreat from history and psychoanalysis in the 1950s and early 1960s.
* Things Hidden: Foundation of the World (1974): turning point, focus on collective violence and scapegoating.
	+ Discovered the power of Greek tragedians, particularly Oedipus cycle and The Bacchae by Euripides.
	+ Freud's insight in Totem and Taboo was influential but misunderstood the scapegoat mechanism as a constant factor in human culture.
* Mimetic concept led to understanding of essential argument of Violence and the Sacred (1972).

### Discovering hidden treasures: Girard's influential work and career at Stanford University

**Girard's Most Important Work: "Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World" (1978)**
- Declared himself as a Christian in this book
- Advocated for nonsacrificial reading of Gospels and divinity of Christ
- Shocked and alienated some in France due to universal anthropological theory and affirmation of biblical revelation
- Format: dialogue with psychiatrists Jean-Michel Oughourlian and Guy Lefort, divided into three parts: Fundamental Anthropology, Judeo-Christian Scriptures, Interdividual Psychology

**Impact in France**
- Cause célèbre or bête noire for some due to arguments against language's all-encompassing nature and affirmation of Christianity
- New reading audience for "Violence and the Sacred"

**Slow Influence in North America**
- Translation of "Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World" by Stanford University Press (1987) was a significant step forward
- Formation of Colloquium on Violence and Religion

**Girard's Career at Stanford University (1981-1995)**
- Accepted position as Andrew B. Hammond Professor of French Language, Literature, and Civilization
- Good setting for research but faced challenges from political correctness in American education.


### The Colloquium on Violence and Religion: Exploring Mimetic Theory's Impact on Academia

**Girard's Stance on Traditional Disciplines and Classical Learning:**
- Denigration of traditional disciplines and classical learning is an issue for Girard
- Girard became "odd man out" due to his stance toward academic fashions and Christian identity
- Teaching and research were interdisciplinary

**Formation of the Colloquium on Violence and Religion (COV&R):**
- Formed in 1990
- Objective: Explore, criticize, and develop the mimetic model of the relationship between violence and religion in the genesis and maintenance of culture
- Presupposes Girard's work as the center and starting point
- Includes many people who do not share his religious views or differ with him on certain points of the mimetic theory
- Over 200 members, primarily in the United States and Europe
- Annual symposium held in middle to late spring, and a shorter meeting each year at the American Academy of Religion and Society of Biblical Literature convention
- Biannual bulletin featuring a bibliography of literature on the mimetic theory, financially underwritten by the University of Innsbruck
- Annual journal, Contagion: Journal of Violence, Mimesis, and Culture, published since 1994

**Members' Reactions:**
- Many academics dissatisfied with conditions and attitudes in academia
- Lack of interest in humanistic and interdisciplinary studies
- Greater support for disciplines more closely connected to the marketplace
- Refusal of political correctness that pretends to uphold victims' rights but affirms a hodgepodge which undercuts consistent moral vision and gives advantage to individual self-fulfillment or victimization power plays.


### Interdisciplinary exploration of Mimetic Theory by scholars in academia, religion, and psychology. Girard writing on Christianity and myth.

COV&R membership includes ministers, psychiatrists, and psychologists, as well as retired academics, all actively engaged in overlapping fields. Girard's focus is on a book about Christianity and myth differences, not just comparisons. (Overview of Mimetic Theory)


## Chapter 1 Mimesis and Violence

**Mimesis and Violence**

**Girard's Mimetic Model**:
- Essential reading for beginners in Girard's work
- Appeared in Berkshire Review 14 (1979): 9-19

**Acquisition and Appropriation**:
- Not included as modes of behavior imitated
- Including acquisition/appropriation would make imitation more problematic and conflictual
- If A imitates B's appropriative gesture, they become rivals for the same object
- Reciprocal imitative rivalry can lead to violence as each tries to prevent the other from obtaining the desired object

**Violence and Mimetic Escalation**:
- Violence is the process itself when two or more partners try to prevent each other from appropriating an object
- Tendency to look for discrete acts of violence, rather than recognizing the continuities and reciprocities of the mimetic escalation
- Aggression seen as a separate instinct, rather than a result of mimetic rivalry


### Interpreting human conflict through mimetic rivalry and ritual behavior.

**Mimetic Rivalry as a Theory of Conflict**

**Background:**
- Some individuals more aggressive than others, but this doesn't explain human conflict fully
- Scarcity or monopolization not the sole cause of violence
- Imitation or mimicry in animals and humans

**Mimetic Rivalry Theory:**
- Offers a different perspective on human conflict
- Emphasizes undifferentiated reciprocity resulting from mimetic rivalry

**Characteristics:**
- Involves competition for objects, not just elimination of aggression
- Can cause disruption and chaos in societies
- Seen in mythology as natural disasters or conflicts between close relatives

**Impact on Human Culture:**
- Religious prohibitions and taboos aim to prevent mimetic rivalry
- Rituals confirm that human communities are obsessed with this type of conflict
- Seasonal festivals, initiation rituals, and social breakdowns can be interpreted as reenactments or crises in mimetic conflict.

**Implications:**
- Mimetic rivalry is a common denominator for various aspects of human society and culture
- Understanding this theory sheds light on the origins and significance of religious institutions, rituals, and social behaviors.


### The role of sacrifice in resolving collective crises through scapegoat effect.

**The Mystery of Ritual**
- The failure of religious anthropology to explain the mystery of ritual is significant
- This failure is compounded by denying the existence of the problem and minimizing the role of religion in human culture

**Sacrifice as Key to the Mystery**
- The key to the mystery lies in the decisive reordering that occurs at the end of a ritual performance, often through sacrifice
- Sacrifice stands in the same relationship to the ritual crisis as the death or expulsion of the hero to the undifferentiated chaos at the beginning of myths
- Real or symbolic, **sacrifice** is primarily a collective action of the entire community that purifies itself of its own disorder through the unanimous immolation of a victim
- This can only happen at the paroxysm of the ritual crisis

**Variations and Constants of Sacrificial Immolation**
- Not all rituals fit this definition exactly, but apparent deviations can be brought back to the common denominator of sacrificial immolation

**The Belief in Sacrifice's Purification Power**
- Religious communities believe they can be purged of their various ills and primarily internal violence through the immolation of a victim
- This belief must be taken seriously, and the variations and constants of **sacrificial immolation** suggest a real event behind blood sacrifice that occurs in all human communities as a model for religious ritual

**Freud's Interpretation vs. the Author's View**
- Freud was right to discover that this model is a collective murder, but wrong in his interpretation of that murder
- The author believes the problem is made difficult by the necessary misinterpretation and transfiguration of the event by religious communities themselves
- This misinterpretation is an essential aspect of the collective murder itself, as it effectively resolves and terminates crises of mimetic rivalry among human groups

**Scapegoat Effect**
- **Scapegoat effect**: The strange process through which two or more people are reconciled at the expense of a third party who appears guilty or responsible for what ails, disturbs, or frightens the scapegoaters
- They feel relieved of their tensions and coalesce into a more harmonious group


### Mob behavior: Mimetic rivalry, scapegoating, and collective violence.

**Scapegoat Effects**

**Purpose of Scapgoating**:
- Single purpose: prevent scapegoat from harming group by expelling and destroying it

**Effects of Scapegoating**:
- Can make mob more furious, but also bring tranquility
- Tranquility not restored without some form of victimization to assuage desire for violence

**Collective Belief in Scapegoat Culprit**:
- Mobs appear insincere and hypocritical to detached observer
- Mobs truly believe scapegoat is culprit

**Generation of Scapegoat Effects**:
- Real, but not Freudian unconscious phenomenon
- Mimetic effects generated by mimetic rivalry at high intensity
- Mimesis is mimetically attractive, leading group members to join in

**Mob Behavior and Mimetic Rivalry**:
- Loss of differentiation as group turns into mob under mimetic rivalry's effect
- Feedback process leads to reciprocity and violence, with antagonists becoming more fascinated by each other
- Violence is a byproduct of mimetic rivalry, not originary


### Mimetic rivalry and its role in religious practices: Uniting through scapegoat sacrifice.

**Mimetic Rivalry and Religious Practices:**
- **Mimetic rivalry**: Intense focus on antagonists, leading to selection of new antagonisms for mimetic reasons
- Antagonism ultimately unites group through shared destruction or expulsion of scapegoat
- Prohibitions and rituals serve same purpose: sparing community from mimetic perturbations
  - Normal circumstances: prohibitions effective
  - Abnormal circumstances: prohibitions ineffective, ritual sacrifice with substitute victim
- Opposition between prohibitions and rituals explained by mimetic reading
- Current views of ritual as essentially transgressive contradictory to purpose of reconciliation and reordering through sacrifice.

**Mimetic Rivalry and Antagonism:**
- Selection of antagonist depends on mimetic factor in paroxystic level
- Transfers of antagonism take place for purely mimetic reasons
- Mimetic attraction increases with number of converging on same antagonist, leading to snowball effect involving entire group minus scapegoats
- Divisive effect of mimetic appropriation contrasted by unitive effect of mimetic antagonism.

**Prohibitions and Rituals:**
- Purpose: sparing community from mimetic perturbations
- Normal circumstances: prohibitions serve purpose through containment
- Abnormal circumstances: prohibitions ineffective, ritual sacrifice triggers happy solution with substitute victim
- Opposition between prohibitions and rituals explained by mimetic reading
  - Contradiction or unintelligible contradiction for some theorists
  - Minimized or maximized by others based on contemporary ethos.


### Scapegoating and its paradoxical role in restoring social order.

**Scapegoating: Understanding Its True Paradox**

**Impasse of Modern Interpretation**:
- Wide road has turned out to be an impasse
- Will not take this road
- Perceive the true paradox of ritual - genesis and regeneration as well as degeneration of cultural order through paroxystic disorder

**Mythology and Religious Cults**:
- Form systems of representation untrue to their own genesis
- Episodes of mimetic violence and reconciliation are always recollected, narrated, and reenacted from the perspective of its beneficiaries (religious community)

**Scapegoating's True Nature**:
- Scapegoat effect is only effective if victim is perceived as truly responsible for troubles that end with its collective death
- Community cannot be at peace if they doubt the victim's enormous capacity for evil
- The belief in victim's enormous capacity for good directly follows from first belief

**Scapegoating's Dependency**:
- Mythic systems of representation obliterate scapegoating on which they are founded
- Scapegoating has never been conceived by anyone as an activity in which they participate, even while denouncing it in others
- Denunciation can become a precondition for successful scapegoating

**Traces of Scapegoating**:
- Effectively reconciles a disturbed community
- Traces are elusive since phenomenon is necessarily recollected from the deluded standpoint it generates

**Characteristics of Deluded Standpoint**:
- Victim cannot be perceived as innocent and impotent
- Must be perceived as a creature truly responsible for disorders and ailments of the community (mimetic crisis)

**Verification**:
- These characteristics are easily ascertainable in primitive mythology, constants or near-constants in contradistinction to significant variables that demand lengthier analysis.


### Analyzing the origins of scapegoating in Oedipus myth and mythology.

**The Oedipus Myth: A Scapegoat Narrative**

**Scapegoating**:
- The view of a subversive individual as a threat to the communal order
- Their continued presence is undesirable and must be destroyed or driven away

**The Oedipus Myth**:
- Does not explicitly present Oedipus as a mimetic scapegoat
- This silence confirms the theory, as it reflects the standpoint of the scapegoaters
- These individuals truly believe the victim is responsible for the plague in their midst
- This responsibility is connected to anti-natural acts and transgressions against the social order

**Understanding Persecution**:
- Historians have long recognized these themes as indicative of persecution
- The greatest specialists in mythology are still fooled by these themes
- This may be due to their cultural distance from the subject matter
- "Primitive" or archaic peoples are often more fooled by their own myths than by those of others
- The ability to see through the collective delusions of scapegoating is growing

**The Mimetic Victimage Hypothesis**:
- Recognizing mimetic victimage as the major "referent" behind mythology is on the brink of occurring
- This will be a step in an advance that began long ago and is not yet over
- Current formal, structural readings are limited in their failure to consider the possibility that mythological systems may be amenable to a new hypothesis on their ultimate origin.


### The role of biblical texts in understanding societal evolution and victimage phenomena

**Theoretical Significance of Victimage Effects**
- **Structuralists and poststructuralists**: Criticize author's hypothesis as theoretically regressive
- Reason: Failure to fully understand its nature and significance
- **Uncertainty principle**: As knowledge increases, victimage effects become marginalized
- Primitive religion based on phenomena similar but not identical to modern occurrences
- Victimage phenomena observed in degenerate forms, leading to increased doses

**The Role of Sacrifice and Persecution**
- Degeneration of sacrificial means in society
- No return to rigidities of prohibition and ritual
- Unique evolution requiring special explanation
- **Proposed answer**: Presence of biblical text in our midst

**Implications of the Biblical Text**
- Surprising and potentially scandalous suggestion for some intellectual world
- Belief that biblical tendency to "side with victims" has ethical consequences only
- Author argues for epistemological consequences as well
- Archaic texts reflect collective violence hidden infrastructure of all societies.


### Exploring biblical narratives: Joseph's story and the human response to victimhood.

**The Joseph Story: A Counter-Mythical Perspective on Victimage**

**Background:**
- Mythology emerges as unjustified or arbitrary
- Biblical text rejects this perspective, sees Joseph as innocent victim of brothers' jealousy

**Joseph and His Brothers:**
- Eleven brothers expel twelfth brother, Joseph
- Belief: Joseph is guilty, has betrayed their father Potiphar
- Biblical text disbelieves this accusation, recognizes it as a story created by a disturbed community seeking scapegoat relief

**Joseph's Test:**
- Brothers come for grain, warned they won't get any if they don't bring Benjamin
- Joseph plants a cup in Benjamin's bag, search finds young brother guilty of theft
- Judah offers to take Benjamin's place as prisoner

**Significance:**
- Story typical of the Bible in its counter-mythical treatment of victimage
- Focus on revelation of victimage, not perpetrators
- Other similar stories and texts espouse this perspective, e.g., penitential psalms, book of Job, prophetic inspiration.


### Exploring the complex relationship between Judeo-Christian scriptures and sacrificial practices.

**Impact of Judeo-Christian Scriptures on Society**
* Responsibility for victim's death placed on community, not God in some parts
* God presented as nonviolent in the text of Gospels
* Christ dies against sacrifice and reveals its nature and origin
* Ambiguity or contradiction remains in Christian theology but not in Gospels
* Use of "sacrifice" misleading for Passion and other rituals
* Question if same word can be used for Joseph's brothers' deed and Judah's willingness to die
* Societal awareness of victimization increased due to Judeo-Christian scriptures and sacrificial influence
* Complex interaction between Judeo-Christian and sacrificial forces shaping our society.


## Chapter 2 The Surrogate Victim

**Chapter 2: The Surrogate Victim**
* Conclusion of Violence and the Sacred by René Girard (1977)
* Emphasizes surrogate victim as cultural antidote to violence in sacrifice, scapegoating, Greek drama, etc.
* No development of mimetic desire concept.

**Origins of Myth and Ritual**:
- A theory of primitive religion emerges from investigation into myth's origins.
- Premises:
  - Imitations of violence had real origin in an event.
  - Event not restricted to any one context or intellectual framework.
  - View event as absolute beginning for societies and relative beginning.

**Event's Absolute Beginning**:
- Signifies passage from nonhuman to human existence.

**Relative Beginning for Societies**:
- Applies to specific societies in question.


### Theory of the Surrogate Victim: Hidden generative violence in religion and myths

**Theory of Surrogate Victim:**
- Based on facts from enigmatic sources: religious and cultural texts
- Facts are not directly accessible
- Comparative method used for analysis
- Evolution of theory similar to theory of evolution
- Inaccessible generative event is essential part of the theory
- Misapprehension indispensable for all religious or postreligious structuring
- Primordial role of religion in primitive societies explained
- No area left in shadow, accounts for all features of cultural phenomena
- Generative violence can be deduced from myths and rituals once structures are perceived.

**Comparison with Theory of Evolution:**
- Both theories present hypotheses to explain inaccessible generative events
- Obstacle to retaining structuring influence is essential part of each theory
- Hidden nature corresponds to researcher's inability to attribute satisfactory function to religious practices.

**Distinction from Psychoanalytical Explanations:**
- Surrogate victim theory leaves no areas in shadow and neglectes no major aspects
- No justification for idea that religious thought represses or refuses to acknowledge threatening self-awareness.

**Myths, Rituals, and Greek Tragedy:**
- Comparison of myths, rituals, and Greek tragedy leads to theory of surrogate victim and violent unanimity
- Path more direct than psychoanalytical explanations like "verbal slips" to psychoanalytic concepts
- Surrogate victim theory is only hypothesis that accounts for all features of cultural phenomena presented.


### Religious rituals and the role of chance in selecting victims

**Religious Misapprehensions vs. Psychoanalysis**
- Freud's perspective on religion: seen as a threat, something to be hidden and kept hidden (Oedipus Complex)
- Religious misapprehensions not crucial to religious attitude or mind
- Generative mechanism for transforming bad into good not conceivable as spontaneous phenomenon

**Arbitrary Victim Selection in Sacrifices**
- Not indispensable, even if best concealed aspect is revealed
- Elements often unrecognizable when reproduced in mythical or ritualistic form
- Chance in victim selection: essential but frequently overlooked
  - Rituals designed to include chance (e.g., Uitoto Indians' balloon game, Kayans' top)
  - Canelos Indians' funeral rites involve dice game with sacred spirit determining outcome
    - Men divided into rival groups, line up on either side of deceased
    - Winner awarded domestic animal that is slaughtered and prepared for mourners.

**Misconceptions about Religious Practices**
- Incongruous to modern perception (games during funeral rites)
- Games not additions but integral part of ceremonies (Canelos Indians' dice game)


### Origin of games from sacred rituals involving chance and violence

**The Sacred Connection between Games of Chance and Rites**

**Modern Perception vs. Indigenous Traditions**:
- Modern man sees games of chance as exclusively secular
- This perception should not be projected onto indigenous traditions like the Canelos Indians
- Games originate in rites, not vice versa

**Role of Chance in Rituals and Mythology**:
- **Chance (Tychè)**: Frequently invoked in folklore, myth, and fable
- Chance is often used to "find" kings or designate someone for a difficult mission
- This theme of Chance supports the idea of surrogate victimhood

**Biblical Example: The Book of Jonah**
- God tells Jonah to warn Nineveh, but he tries to evade this task
- A violent storm is sent to force Jonah's hand
- Drawing lots was a method used in Old Testament times to make important decisions


### Sacrificial crisis resolution through Jonah's story: Chance, lotteries, and divine will.

**Sacrificial Crisis: The Story of Jonah**

**Background:**
- Community facing crisis represented by tempest at sea (Jonah 1:4-7)
- Passengers cast lots to determine responsibility
- Chance reveals truth, designates Jonah as culprit

**Jonah's Confession and Resolution:**
- Recognition of futility in saving his life (Jonah 1:10-12)
- Crew addresses Lord for deliverance from crisis
- Sacrifice offered to Lord, new god acknowledged (Jonah 1:14-16)

**Significance:**
- Primitive view of Chance as sacred and capricious
- Relationship between Chance and generative violence underlined in sacrificial rites.

**Modern Perspective:**
- Differences from primitive beliefs regarding Chance and the sacred.


### An essay on communal violence, Hestia, and the divine in ancient Greek religion.

**The Ritual in Cos:**
- Festival dedicated to Zeus
- Selection of victim by lottery
- Animal introduced to Hestia for rites
- Originates from communal violence
- Merger of distinctions into a common togetherness

**Hestia and the Common Hearth:**
- Symbolizes the place where original act of communal violence was perpetrated
- Selection by lottery simulates this original violence
- Divine Chance determines victim selection
- Deliberate confusion of distinctions and merger into a communal mass

**The Concepts of Gods and Divinity:**
- Scholars struggle to define these concepts
- Public opinion defines them arbitrarily
- Importance lies in common basis for all gods' distinctive qualities

**Religion and Science:**
- No true science of religion or culture
- Disputes over which god tragedy should be ascribed to
- Secondary problem compared to relationship between tragedy, theater, and the divine

**The Surrogate Victim Theory:**
- Scientific approach to defining terms like "divinity," "ritual," "rite," and "religion"
- Any phenomenon related to remembering, commemorating, and perpetuating a unanimity that springs from the murder of a surrogate victim can be termed religious
- Offers no simple substitute for the diversity of myths and rituals
- Mechanism proposes going beyond mere cataloging of characteristics.


### Exploring the scapegoat concept in religious systems through hypothesis and language.

**Approach to Theory**
- Positive line of inquiry towards hypothesis
- Confidence in language for expressing truth
- Thesis: Surrogate victim as cornerstone of religious edifice
- Hypothesis should account for all items it claims to cover
- Enable assignment of origin, function, and structure to primitive institutions
- Organize and assess ethnological data economically
- Applicability in every conceivable situation

**Theme of Scapegoat**
- Incoherence associated with scapegoating concept
- Frazer's treatment of the theme: abundance of description, paucity of explanation
- Refusal to consider forces behind religious significations
- Contempt for religious themes prevents understanding.

**Savage Mind and Principle of Vicarious Suffering**
- Confusion between physical and mental, material and immaterial
- Shifting burden from self to another through unamiable devices
- Example: shifting load from own back to another's
- Misconception that it's possible to shift intangible burdens as easily as tangible ones.


### J.G. Frazer: Misunderstood scholar of religion and sacrifice

**Frazer's Contribution and Criticism:**
- Despite some criticisms, Frazer is highly regarded for his diligence in the field of mythology and clear presentation of findings
- Later writers have largely repeated Frazer's views on sacrifice, often without acknowledging the violent impulse behind the rite
- Frazer's work has contributed to the concealment of this violent impulse in the study of sacrifice
- His terms like "physical loads" and "bodily and mental ailments" recall outdated ideas from second-rate theologians
- Frazer treated sacrificial substitution as pure fantasy, neglecting its vital role in curtailing reciprocal violence within communities

**Modern Attitudes towards Religion:**
- Modern thinkers often view religion as an isolated, wholly fictitious phenomenon
- This attitude is seen as a form of scapegoating where religion bears the responsibility for societal violence that pertains to all societies
- The Freudian notion of transference should have provided greater insight into this issue but has been overlooked by some modern authors

**Frazer's Approach and Impact:**
- Frazer and his rationalist colleagues perpetually dismissed religion as a scapegoat for human thought
- This act of handwashing has long been recognized as an intellectual equivalent of ancient customs, but Frazer was unaware of this connection
- His writing amounts to a fanatical dismissal of all the fanaticism and superstition he had spent his life studying

**Resistance to Change:**
- Resistance against shedding ignorance is present today more than ever before
- This resistance is similar to Freud's concept of resistance but is far more formidable
- We are dealing with deeply entrenched modernist myths that claim to be free from mythical influence.


### A new sacrificial crisis in modern thought: rediscovering the role of violence in human society.

**Modern Thought and Ethnology:**
* Freud's influence on modern thought extends to ethnology
* Evidence of a new sacrificial crisis
* Essential violence returning in a spectacular manner
* Violence plays a significant role in human society
* Traditional modes of interpretation sick, ethnology thriving
* Re-examination of the role of violence in society invited for the first time.

**Sacred Crisis:**
* Society has managed to extricate itself from the sacred to some extent
* Loss of memory about generative violence
* Violence rediscovered through subversive knowledge and violent history
* Crisis invites exposure of role of violence in human society to reason.


## Chapter 3 Triangular Desire

**Triangular Desire and Mimesis (Girard's Thought)**

**Concepts:**
- *Mimesis* or *mimetic desire*: essential concept for understanding Girard's thought
- Greek word makes conflictual aspect conceivable, not possible with imitation

**Triangular Structure of Desire:**
1. Self/Subject
2. Other as mediator (later model*)
3. Object desired because of the other's desire or perceived desire

**Discussed Topics:**
- Internal and external mediation
- Rivalry, resentment, envy, vanity
- Illusory nature of spontaneous desire

**Mimesis as a Capacity and Force:**
- Intertwined with representation in human culture
- Prior to cognition and representation (further reading: Things Hidden, 1-23; "To Double Business Bound," 200-203; epilogue interview)

**Quote:**
> Amadis of Gaul was one of the most perfect knight errants... When a painter wants to become famous for his art he tries to imitate the originals of the best masters he knows... The man who wishes to be known as careful and patient should and does imitate Ulysses... Virgil shows us in the person of Aeneas the valor of a pious son and the wisdom of a valiant captain... They depict them not as they are but as they should be, to provide an example of virtue for centuries to come.


### Don Quixote's Desire: Mediator of the Chivalric Triangle in Literature

**Don Quixote's Chivalric Desire:**
* Don Quixote imitates Amadis as model of chivalry
* No longer chooses objects of desire (Amadis does)
* Disciples pursue determined objectives
* Mediator of desire: Amadis
* Triangular relationship: subject, mediator, object
	+ Triangle is a systematic metaphor in relationships
	+ Not destructive despite changes in size and shape
	+ Represents mystery of human relations
* Structural thinking assumes human reality is intelligible and logical
* Writers intuitively understand the system they inhabit.

**Don Quixote's Chivalric Desire (Continued):**
* Don Quixote surrenders control to Amadis
* Objects of desire determined by model of chivalry
* Imitation of Christ-like existence: Amadis as mediator
* Simpler desires in most fiction works
	+ No mediator, subject and object are direct
* Desire is spontaneous but can be explained through psychology or liberty
* Triangle relationship present in all adventures.


### Exploring Triangular Desire and Mediator's Influence in Don Quixote's Chivalric Passion.

**Triangular Desire and Literary Criticism:**
- **Criticism**: formalizes implicit or already half-explicit systems
- Value lies in literary substance, not disguise or shirking of fundamental issues
- Don Quixote's case: victim of triangular desire with Sancho Panza
  - Imaginary island as new triangle's angle
  - Loss of reality and paralyzed judgment
- Chivalric passion defines desire according to the Other, opposed to self
- Amadis is a fictitious person, but Don Quixote's desires come from an imaginary mediator (Don Quixote)
- Cervantes' work explores the influencing power of lucid minds on one another.

**Don Quixote and Sancho Panza:**
- Both victims of triangular desire in "The Influence of Triangular Desire on Reality" by Cervantes
- Don Quixote suggests new desires to Sancho (oral suggestion)
  - Island governorship, duchess title for daughter
- Loss of reality and judgment paralysis for both characters
- Contrast between idealist Don Quixote and realist Sancho is real but secondary.

**Triangular Desire:**
- Definition: desire according to the Other opposed to self
- Characters borrow desires from an imaginary mediator (Don Quixote)
- Influences loss of reality and judgment paralysis.


### Imitation of desires in literature and its impact on characters' personalities.

**The Illusion of Desire and Imitation**

**Bizarre Marriage of Consciousnesses**:
- Chivalric literature, multiplied by printing press, increases chances for similar unions
- Desire based on "Other" and "seminal" function of literature in Flaubert's novels
- Characters like Emma Bovary desire through romantic heroines who fill their imagination

**Bovarysm**: 
- Lack of individuality, inconsistency, and spontaneity
- Imitation of external models for self-definition
- External aspects of imitation are most striking

**Role of Suggestion and Imitation in Personality**:
- Characters of Cervantes and Flaubert imitate desires of freely chosen models
- Mathilde de la Mole finds models in family history; Julien Sorel imitates Napoleon
- **Stendhal**: 
  - Memoirs of Saint Helena, Bulletins of the Grand Army suggest feelings and desires
  - Julien borrows desire to eat at master's table from Rousseau's Confessions
  - Use of "vanity" (vanité) to indicate forms of imitation
- The vaniteux (vain person) cannot draw desires from own resources, must borrow them from others

**Triangular Desire**:
- Found in Stendhal's characters like M. de Rênal's desire for Julien Sorel as tutor, not for children's sake


### Desire and vanity fueled by imaginary rivalries in Stendhal's "The Red and the Black"

**Stendhal's Novel: The Triangle of Desire**

**The Mayor of Verrières and Old Mr. Sorel:**
- The mayor always has an image of his rival before him during negotiations with old Mr. Sorel, Julien's father
- The sly peasant makes favorable propositions but invents brilliant replies to increase price
- The imaginary desire attributed by the buyer serves as a model for the increasing price

**Julien and Mathilde:**
- Julien tries to win back Mathilde de la Mole
- He resorts to the same trick as his father, paying court to the Maréchale de Fervacques to arouse her desire before Mathilde
- This reawakens Mathilde's own desire and creates a triangle with the Maréchale, M. de Rênal, Valenod, and Julien

**Vanity and Rivalry:**
- A vaniteux desires an object when convinced it is already desired by another person
- The mediator, brought into existence by vanity, demands defeat to satisfy the subject's desire
- This creates two competing desires: one for the mediator and one for the object
- The mediator acts as both model and obstacle, showing the gate of paradise while forbidding entry.

**Imaginary Desire:**
- Stendhal speaks of vanity in ambition, business, or love
- The triangle reappears in each instance where vanity is present
- The mediator himself desires the object, creating a second desire exactly the same as his own.


### Distinction between external and internal mediation in literature: Cervantes vs. Stendhal.

**Relationships between Mediator and Desiring Subject:**
- **Cervantes' Don Quixote**: vast difference in look cast by M. de Rênal on Valenod compared to Don Quixote's relation with Amadis
  * Mediator is enthroned in an inaccessible heaven, transmitting serenity to faithful follower
- **Stendhal's Characters**: mediator has come down to earth
  * Clear distinction between relationships indicates spiritual gap separating Don Quixote from Stendhal's characters
- **Image of Triangle Relationship**: allows distinction and ensures gap for understanding
  * Distance between mediator and desiring subject varies in triangle
- **Distance in Triangle:** greatest in Cervantes, no contact between Don Quixote and Amadis
  * Emma Bovary: closer to her Parisian mediator but still fleeting proximity
  * Julien Sorel: spans the distance, becomes lover of Mathilde, rises to brilliant position
- **Stendhal's Universe**: mediator is within same universe as hero
  * Romantic works grouped into external and internal mediation categories

**External Mediation:**
- Distance sufficient to eliminate contact between spheres of possibility centered around mediator and subject

**Internal Mediation:**
- Distance reduced enough for spheres to penetrate each other more or less profoundly
  * Not measured by physical space but primarily spiritual.


### Desire and mediation: Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and hatred in external vs. internal mediations.

**Relationship Between Don Quixote and Sancho:**
- Physical proximity but insurmountable social/intellectual distance
- Sancho desires objects Don Quixote lets him have
- Don Quixote promises imaginary island to Sancho as vassal

**Characteristics of External Mediation:**
- Open worship of model
- Harmony between companions not seriously troubled
- No rivalry with mediator possible

**Comparison with Internal Mediation:**
- Imitation is just as strict and literal as in internal mediation
- Hero hides imitation efforts from others, including self
- Impulse toward object is ultimately an impulse toward the mediator

**Effects of External Mediation:**
- Discordance between disciple's feelings and model's perceived attitude
- Intense malice towards mediator despite reverence
- Object of hatred: someone who prevents satisfaction of desire inspired by mediator
- Secret admiration concealed from self and others.

**The Passion of Hatred:**
- Rooted in inability to satisfy a desire inspired by mediator
- Reversal of logical order of desires to hide imitation
- Mediator's apparent hostility increases prestige, strengthening bonds of mediation.


### Jealousy and Envy: Internal Mediation and Imitation of Desires

**Resentment (Ressentiment) and Internal Mediation**

**Overview:**
- Shrewd enemy that belittles subject's desires but secretly desired
- Obstacle to ambitions
- Result of internal mediation
- Impassioned admiration and emulation stumble over this obstacle, causing impotent hatred and psychological self-poisoning

**Characteristics:**
- Model blocks way of disciple's desires
- Ressentiment imposes its perspective on even those it does not dominate
- Prevents recognition of imitation in the birth of desire

**Jealousy and Envy:**
- Triangular relationships: object, subject, third person
- Victims convince themselves that their desire is spontaneous and deeply rooted in the object
- Reduces jealousy to irritation when desire is thwarted
- True jealousy contains fascination with insolent rival
- Chronic victims have a "jealous temperament" or "envious nature" implying an irresistible impulse to desire what Others desire

**Envy:**
- Feeling of impotence in acquiring something belonging to another
- Transformation of passive obstacle into concerted opposition by envious person's imagination

**Max Scheler's Perspective:**
- Envy, jealousy, and rivalry are sources of ressentiment
- Defines envy as a feeling of impotence that vitiates attempt to acquire something because it belongs to another.


### Analyzing Envy: The Role of Mediators in Desire and Rivalry.

**Envy: A Closer Look Beyond Possession**

**Causes of Envy:**
- Failure to acquire an object leads to feelings of impotence and envy
- Self-deception about cause of failure
- Paralysis accompanied by envy

**Understanding Envy:**
- Rivalry aggravates meditation, increasing prestige of mediator
- Possession is a passive obstacle that seems deliberate expression of contempt
- Subject may question deserving condemnation or possessiveness
- Other objects have no worth if compared to the "mediated" object

**Mediator's Role in Envy:**
- The mediator, not possession, is both point of departure and conclusion for analysis
- Rivalry increases bond between subject and object through possession desire
- Mediation confers prestige on object and intensifies its desirability

**Comparing Oneself to Others:**
- Max Scheler's intuition: humans have a tendency to compare themselves with others
- Comparison leads to jealousy, ambition, imitation of models, even idealization like 'imitation of Christ'

**Modern Emotions and Envy:**
- Stendhal warns against modern emotions (envy, jealously, impotent hatred) as fruits of universal vanity in The Memoirs of a Tourist
- These emotions flourish not due to increase in envious natures but because internal mediation triumphs in a world where differences between men are erased.


### Stendhal's irony: Novelists expose imitation in desire's disguise, revealing the role of the mediator and the self-deception in desires' origins.

**The Imitative Nature of Desire**

**Great Novelists Reveal the Imitative Nature of Desire**:
- In modern times, the nature of desire is hard to perceive as it is vigorously denied
- Don Quixote proclaimed himself a disciple of Amadis, and 19th-century writers saw themselves as disciples of the Ancients
- The romantic "vaniteux" does not want to be anyone's disciple, professing to be thoroughly original

**Spontaneity as a Universal Dogma**:
- Spontaneity becomes a universal dogma, succeeding imitation
- Stendhal warns us not to be fooled by these individualisms, which merely hide a new form of imitation
- Romantic revulsion, hatred of society, and nostalgia for the desert usually conceal a morbid concern for the Other

**Desire and the Other**:
- The novelist lets his characters act and speak, then reveals to us the mediator
- He reestablishes the true hierarchy of desire while pretending to believe in the weak reasoning of the character
- The romantic "vaniteux" wants to convince themselves that their desire is written into the nature of things or emanating from a serene subjectivity, not rooted in the Other

**Objective and Subjective Fallacies**:
- Objectivisms and subjectivisms, romanticisms and realisms, individualisms and scientisms, idealisms and positivisms are opposed but secretly agree to conceal the presence of the mediator
- These dogmas are translations of worldviews peculiar to internal mediation


### Romantic vs. novelistic literature: Revealing mediated desire versus passive reflection

**The Illusion of Spontaneity**
- Some works of literature defend the illusion of **autonomy** that modern man is passionately devoted to
- Great novels like those by Cervantes, Flaubert, and Stendhal reveal the truth about desire, but this truth remains hidden even at its revelation
- Readers often apply their own meanings to works, overlooking the mediation present in the texts

**Romantic vs. Novelistic Works**
- **Romanesque** works: Passively reflect mediated desire without revealing it
- **Novelistic** works: Reveal the presence of a mediator
- The terms are not interchangeable, but their opposition is significant

**Literary Categories**
- The present categories are dialectical, not mechanistic or positivistic
- They are not independent labels, but rather reveal the dynamic nature of literary works
- No single category can be appraised separately, as they are interrelated in understanding the nuances of specific texts.


### Structural significance of oppositions: essential for understanding systems.

Essential oppositions maintain system's significance, interconnected terms complete its structure.

**Explanation**: The original text states that oppositions, or contrasting elements, are essential in understanding a system, and these elements should not be separated. Instead, they contribute to the overall meaning and completeness of the system as a whole, which aligns with a structural hypothesis.


## Chapter 4 Desire and the Unity of Novelistic Conclusions

**Chapter 4: Desire and the Unity of Novelistic Conclusions**

**Summary of Girard's Argument**:
- In great novels by authors like Cervantes, Stendhal, Flaubert, Proust, and Dostoyevsky, novelistic (nonromantic) conclusions represent conversions from the death that results from rivalrous desire.
- These authors attain a profound communion of Self and Other, intuit their own similarity to the Other who is a model/mediator or even an obstacle, and find liberation from romantic individualism.
- The climax of this conversionary discovery occurs most prominently in Dostoyevsky's work, with "Notes from the Underground" as the turning point between romanticism and the novel.

**Dostoyevsky's Novels**:
- In **"The Brothers Karamazov"**, the old man Stepan Trofimovitch's death is contrasted with the redeeming conversion of Stavrogin's death - Stepan's death represents life, while Stavrogin's is only death.
- Similar dual endings are found in Dostoyevsky's other works, such as **"Crime and Punishment"** and **"The Brothers Karamazov"**.

**Stepan Trofimovitch's Transformation**:
- As Stepan approaches death, he withdraws from lying and recognizes that he has spent his life speaking for his own sake rather than the truth.
- The closer Stepan comes to death, the more he contradicts his former ideas.
- The apocalypse in this novel has a positive side, with two antithetical deaths: one that represents an extinction of the spirit and one that is a death yet is spirit.


### Three novelists' controversial religious conclusions in death.

**Dostoyevsky's Novels: Death and Conversions**

**The Gospel Woman**:
- Plays a similar role to Sonia in Dmitri Karamazov
- Mediator between the sinner and the Scriptures
- Restores Raskolnikov and Dmitri Karamazov to life, symbolically

**Dostoyevsky's Religious Conclusions**:
- Criticized by some as artificial, ill-considered, superficially imposed
- Seen as written when Dostoyevsky ran out of novelistic inspiration

**Don Quixote**:
- Hero's death is similar to Stepan Trofimovitch's
- Regains clarity of vision and rejects his former existence
- Recognizes the "extravagance and trickery" of chivalry

**Criticisms of Novel Conclusions**:
- Considered artificial, conventional, superimposed on the novels
- Dostoyevsky and Cervantes seen as obliged to write "conformist" conclusions
- Critics advise not to dwell on these conversions in death

**Stendhal's The Red and the Black**:
- Conclusion is a third conversion in death for Julien
- Repudiates his will to power, makes a break with the world, loses passion for Mathilde


### Renouncing metaphysical desire in novelistic conclusions through hero's repudiation of divine pride and mediators.

**Unity of Novelistic Conclusions**

**Stendhal's Criticism**:
- Author expresses lyricism in his work
- Criticizes author for lack of exercise, portraying him as a "young German student" with an "exalted and weak character"
- Suggests conclusions are insignificant and artificial

**Defending the Text**:
- Hypothesis of self-censure is not worth discussing due to text's beauty
- Don Quixote's final words address both readers and his loved ones
- Romantic critics hostile to conclusions that contradict their beliefs
- Heroes renounce metaphysical desire, repudiating the mediator (divinity) and pride

**Effects of Metaphysical Desire Renunciation**:
- Deception gives way to truth
- Agitation replaced by repose
- Hatred transformed into love
- Humiliation changed to humility
- Deviated transcendency becomes vertical transcendency

**Renouncing Divinity and Pride**:
- Repudiation of the mediator (divinity)
- Implies renunciation of pride
- Physical diminution of hero symbolizes defeat of pride

**Julien Sorel's Realization**:
- "What do Others matter to me, my relations with others are going to be abruptly cut off."
- Renouncing divinity leads to renouncing slavery
- Inversions at every level of existence.


### Novelistic conversions: Solitude and human contact intertwined.

**Metaphysical Desire and Conversion in Literature:**
* Two fundamental categories: solitary hero joining others vs gregarious hero gaining solitude
* Dostoyevsky's novels focus on solitary hero, Stendhal's on gregarious one
* Opposition seems insurmountable but is not
* True conversion engenders new relationships to self and others
* Romantic interpretations lead to mechanical oppositions of solitude and gregariousness
* Both aspects of conversion present in every novel, though developed unequally
* Neglected aspect never completely suppressed: hero's happiness with Others or solitude
* Julien Sorel gains solitude but triumphs over isolation
* Raskolnikov rejects solitude and embraces Others
* Solitude and human contact exist as functions of each other.

**Novelistic Conclusions:**
* All novelistic conclusions are conversions
* Insights from oriental tale: hero's despair leads to salvation, laws of gravity annulled
* Differences between novelistic conclusions negligible, more a shift in accent than opposition.

**Metaphysical Cure and Romanticism:**
* Lack of balance between aspects of metaphysical cure reveals novelist's romantic tendencies
* Novelist remains prisoner of formulas whose purpose they do not perceive.


### Novelistic conclusions: Memory, hero's transformation, renouncing desire, panoramic vision, aesthetic triumph, past revivification, novelistic truth, Prout's inspiration, summarizing meaning.

**Traces of Middle-Class Romanticism in Stendhal's Conclusions**

**Understanding Differences:**
- Critics often reject novelistic conclusions as banal
- Seek originality and contradictions with other novels
- Trace authors back to their romantic origins
- Exalting what is contrary to novelistic truth

**The Hero's Journey:**
- Triumph over metaphysical desire in a tragic conclusion
- Becomes capable of writing the novel
- Separation from hero throughout novel, reunited in conclusion
- Approaching death, hero looks back on lost existence with "breadth and depth of vision"

**Ascending Movement:**
- Expression of new, more detached vision
- Creator's own vision, not to be confused with pride
- Inspiration comes from memory, memory springs from the conclusion

**Novelistic Conclusions as Beginnings:**
- Every novelistic conclusion is a "Past Recaptured"
- Proust's The Red and the Black: inspiration comes from memory
- Heroes make their way to the novel through the novel.


### Proust's self-centeredness, universal self, and novelistic creation.

**Proust's Themes and Spiritual Experiences**
* Don Quixote, Julien Sorel, Raskolnikov share same spiritual experience as Marcel in The Past Recaptured
* Proust's aesthetics not just formulas or percepts, but linked to escaping metaphysical desire
* Novelistic conclusions: self-centeredness barrier to creation; imitation results from it; introspection necessary for understanding Self and Others

**Self-Centeredness in Proust's Work**
* Barrier to novelistic creation
* Impedes contact with others and oneself
* Two contradictory directions: toward self and others
* Triumphing over self-centeredness allows deeper exploration of Self and greater knowledge of Others
* No difference between our own secret and the secret of Others at a certain depth

**Reconciling Particular and Universal**
* Dialectic of metaphysical pride necessary for understanding reconciliation attempt in Proust's work
* Romantic opposition between Self and Others absurd without this context
* Attempt to reconcile differences and celebrate originality, but sometimes falls back into clichés of romanticism.

**Inspiration and Creation in The Past Recaptured**
* Break with modernity inspires novelistic creation
* Absence of desire allows recapture of past desires
* Overcoming self-centeredness necessary for understanding and describing Others.


### Novelistic creation: Self and Other merge through recognizing shared desires and overcoming pride.

**The Connection Between Novelistic Creation and Recognition of Self-Centeredness**

**Renunciation of Fascination and Hatred**:
- A crowning moment in novelistic creation
- Can be found in all great novelists
- The novelist recognizes their similarity to the fascinating Other through their hero
  - Mme. de la Fayette: Recognizes herself in women undone by love
  - Stendhal: Recognizes himself as a hypocrite
  - Dostoyevsky: Recognizes being both superhuman and subhuman
- The novelist recognizes they are guilty of the sin they accuse their hero of

**Merging of Self and Other**:
- The hero's despicable Other becomes the novelist's creation
- This merging occurs through the novelist's self-examination and attention to the mediator
- A synthesis of the two halves of existence is achieved, overcoming pride

**Painful Victory Over Desire**:
- Foregoing "fervent dialogue" at superficial levels of being
- Giving up "dearest illusions"
- Proust's art a "phenomenological epochē", but true epochē is victory over desire

**The Filial Sentiments of a Parricide**:
- An article by Proust on the family of Henri Van Blarenberghe, who killed himself after murdering his mother
- Proust had no special information about the tragedy


### Proust's reflections on parricide, literature, and novelistic unity.

**Proust's Reflection on Novelistic Unity: The Filial Sentiments of a Parricide**

**Symbolism of Van Blarenberghe Affair**:
- Represents mother-son relationship in general
- Parents age prematurely due to children's vices and ingratitude (similar to Jean Santeuil)
- Parricide's lucidity and expiation of crime: opposes life "obsessed by illusions"

**Proust's Literary Inspiration**:
- Classical method of transposition in novel discarded
- Hero will not kill himself, but become a novelist
- Inspiration comes from Proust's own experience and impending death

**Don Quixote Allusion**:
- Proust compares parricide's lucidity to Don Quixote
- Suggests unity of novelistic genius with reference to Dostoyevsky, Flaubert, Tolstoy, George Eliot

**Proust's Awareness of Novel Unity**:
- Noted connection between The Past Recaptured and classical novelistic conclusions
- Could have written comprehensive book on unity of novelistic genius

**Literary Value of Text**:
- Written in haste for a daily newspaper
- May contain melodramatic clichés, but holds significance due to Proust's intentions and connections to his own work.


### Proust's silence on literary influences: fear of extravagance and plagiarism, emphasis on affective memory in "The Past Recaptured", and economy in novel writing.

**Proust's Literary Strategy**

**Acknowledged Predecessors**:
- Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Chateaubriand, Gérard de Nerval - "affective memory"

**Absence of Novelists Mentioned**:
- Proust did not mention any novelist as a literary ancestor
- Fear of appearing extravagant or ridiculous
- Compromise: scrupulously avoided novelists

**Proust's Focus on Originality**:
- Fearing accusations of plagiarism or leaving the "royal paths" of literature
- Emphasized most "original" elements in his novel, especially affective memory

**Explanation for Proust's Silence**:
- Other than "literary strategy", no clear explanation given
- Omission of Stendhal's conclusion on sensations of the soul and revivification of the past
- Proust was the only one to perceive memory's role in ____________________

**Justification for Affective Memory's Central Role**:
- Economy in the novel, not a "fault" or betrayal of original experience
- Proust cleverly combined revelation and "literary strategy" demands

**Proust's Interest in Julien's Death and Abbé Chélan**:
- Perceived role at time of preparing to write The Past Recaptured
- Weakening of great intelligence and heart linked to the body.


### Two contrasting forms of death in literature: lucid vs. intellectual decay.

**The Old Age of a Virtuous Man: Moral Pessimism**

**Julien's Lucid Death**:
- Stands out against the "slow and terrible decomposition of the flesh"
- Attention given by Proust to this episode is not disinterested
- Builds "The Past Recaptured" on a similar contrast between two antithetical deaths

**Contrast Between Spiritually Fertile Death and Cruel Spectacle**:
- Hero is lucid when he dies, to be reborn in the work
- Around him, people continue to die without hope of resurrection
- The spiritually fertile death of the narrator is contrasted with the cruel spectacle of the Guermantes' soirée
- Horrible and useless aging of members of high society

**Unity of Novelistic Conclusions**:
- This contrast is already found in "The Filial Sentiments of a Parricide"
- Gains classically novelistic meaning and achieves unity with the Dostoyevskian apocalypse
- In all genuine novelistic conclusions, death as spirit is victoriously opposed to death of the spirit

**Balzac's "Cousin Pons"**:
- Describes his hero's death and defines the double face of the novelistic apocalypse
- **Ancient and modern sculptors**: Placed genies holding flaming torches, illuminating faults and errors
- **Death has its wisdom**: Simple girls can have the wisdom of old men, become prophets
- Two ways to die: 
    - Dying in the flesh, with lucidity and admirable deaths
    - Dying from intellectual sicknesses, with body and mind foundering together


### Unity of novelistic conclusions: Death and renunciation in Balzac's "Cousin Pons"

**The Conclusion of Novels: Balzac's Perspective**

**Background:**
- Cato, a just man, understood the world before leaving it
- Previously resigned to death with a "joyful artist" attitude
- Last ties binding him to life broken
- Saw himself as robbed by Mme. de Mortsauf
- Renounced pride and embraced truth in his final moments

**Balzac's Novelistic Experience:**
- Essential characteristics of novelistic conclusions:
  - Double face of death
  - Role of suffering
  - Detachment of passion
  - Christian symbolism
  - Sublime lucidity (memory & prophecy)
- Comparison between historical figures and fictional characters
- Unity of novelistic conclusions through analyses and comparisons

**The Hero's Renunciation:**
- Freed from slavery and grasped truth about unhappiness
- Transformation from romantic writer to true novelist
- Confirmation that sickness is rooted in pride
- Conclusion as the primary location of truth
- Error avoids this unity by rendering it powerless.


### Reconciling individual and world through novelistic conclusions: banality vs. inconclusiveness.

**Novelistic Conclusions: Banality and Reconciliation**

**Background:**
- Novelistic conclusions are bound to be banal due to repetition of same thing
- Absolute banality of what is essential in Western civilization
- Reconciliation between individual and world, man and the sacred

**Novelistic Conclusions vs. Originality:**
- Not relative banality of oblivion, rediscovery, and rehabilitation
- Absolute banality of what is essential in Western literature
- Merges with great religious ethics and humanism

**Inability to Conclude:**
- Represents a denied possibility for writers
- Examples: Franz Kafka, Dostoyevsky's Notes from the Underground
- Inability to die in work, free oneself in death (Maurice Blanchot)

**Literary Space of Inconclusiveness:**
- Accessible area before reconciliation
- Disquieting but not surprising for those bearing in mind the evolution of novel structure.

**Evolution of Novel Structure:**
- Turning point between romanticism and the novel
- Preceding inauthentic reconciliations, authentic reconciliations follow.


### The power of Christian symbolism in great novels and artistic creation.

**The Relationship Between Great Novels and Death**

**Great Novels and Historical Significance**:
- Conclusion of great novels embody historical as well as individual possibilities
- The greatest novelistic conclusions are "banal but not conventional"
- They distinguish themselves from deceptive reconciliations in second-rate literature

**Conversion in Death**:
- Conversion in death should not seem like an "easy solution"
- It is a "miraculous descent of novelistic grace"
- The great novels are born from this supreme moment and return to it

**Christian Symbolism in Novels**:
- Christian symbolism is often dismissed as decorative or apologetic
- Truly "scientific" criticism would note the similarities among novelistic conclusions
- Christian symbolism is universal, able to give form to the experience of the novel

**The Author's Perspective**:
- The author sometimes tries to obscure the religious themes
- However, these themes still play an important role, even in works by skeptical authors like Stendhal

**Comparing Novelists**:
- Interpreting novelists requires comparing them to one another


### Comparing spiritual transformations in literature through St. John's verse and novelistic conclusions.

**Understanding Religion in Literature: Stendhal, Proust, and Dostoyevsky**

**Background**
- Treat religious question as novelistic problem
- Comparison of authors' use of Christianity and "mysticism"

**Stendhal:**
- Quote from St. John Gospel in The Brothers Karamazov
  - Links deaths, prison, sickness, confession, Ilusha's death, charitable work of Alyosha
- Connection to Proust and Mme. de la Fayette
  - Necessity of dying leads to detachment from social world
  - New being born from death

**Symbolism in Literature:**
- Repudiation of human mediator
- Renunciation of deviated transcendency
- Vertical transcendency, whether the author is Christian or not

**Great Novelists:**
- Respond to fundamental appeal
- Sometimes hide meaning from themselves

**Stendhal:**
- Irony as response

**Proust:**
- Romantic commonplaces mask true face of novelistic experience
- Symbols of immortality and resurrection appear in an aesthetic context
- Not operetta princes, but true princes disguised as operetta princes

**Symbolism in Stendhal's Work:**
- Long before The Past Recaptured
- Death and funeral of Bergotte: echo and annunciation of original experience.


### The interconnected themes of death, resurrection, and transcendence in Proust and Dostoyevsky's works.

**Resurrection of Bergotte and Proust's Literary Achievement**

**Pretext for Discussion:**
- Burial of Bergotte becomes a symbol of his resurrection
- Romantic cliché used as an excuse to introduce the concept of resurrection in Proust's work

**Significance of Resurrection:**
- Forecasts author's own resurrection and the publication of "The Past Recaptured"
- Vertical transcendency: contrast between angels and demoniacal idols
- Influence from Dostoyevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov"
  - Redeeming punishment and communion
  - Radical break with romantic individualism
  - Abolishment of novelistic and religious experience distinction

**Symbolism:**
- Memory, death, love, resurrection: themes inspired creative ardor in Proust
- Children's reaction to Ilusha's death: memory, joy, gladness, and the belief in resurrection.

**Quotes:**
>"We love you, we love you... Hurrah for Karamazov. And may the dear boy's memory live for ever." (Children in "The Brothers Karamazov")

>"Certainly we shall all rise again, certainly we shall see each other and shall tell each other with joy and gladness all that has happened." (Alyosha)


## Chapter 5 The Goodness of Mimetic Desire

**Mimetic Desire: The Goodness of Imitation**
* **Interview with René Girard by Rebecca Adams (1992)**
	+ Published in Religion and Literature 25, no. 2 (1993)
* Important clarification on mimetic desire being good in itself and the basis of love
* Cannot be renounced by Christians as they must imitate Jesus
* Quand ces choses commenceront... (Paris: Arléa, 1994) also discusses this concept

**Mimetic Desire:**
- Good foundation for love, but can take destructive forms
- Imitation of others leads to desire
- Cannot be renounced by Christians as they follow Christ's example

**Theory of Mimetic Desire:**
- Implies freedom of the will is an illusion
- Suggests a covert suspicion of real agency
- Augustinian idea of bondage of the will

**Girard's Clarification:**
- Believes in freedom of the will
- Jesus' teachings: some are not scandalized by his arrest
- Mimesis is seductive but can be resisted or converted away from.


### Discussing renunciation and mimetic desire in Christianity vs. Buddhism.

**Discussion on Renunciation and Mimetic Desire**

**Renunciation vs. Imitation**:
- The idea of renunciation has been criticized by Puritans and Jansenists, but the blanket hostility towards it is worse
- Advocating the "renunciation of mimetic desire" may be misleading, as mimetic desire itself is a pharmakon (a medicine or poison)
- Simplistic renunciation of desire is more Buddhist than Christian

**Christianity and Mimetic Desire**:
- Christianity wants to uncover the sacrificial origin, while Buddhism advocates getting out of the world
- What is being advocated is not the renunciation of desire, but imitation of a positive model (e.g., imitating Christ or God through Him)

**St. Paul and Mimetic Desire**:
- St. Paul advises to "imitate me" and "think upon these positive things" like love, joy, and peace
- John S. Dunne's concept of "heart's desire" seems similar to the mimetic imitation of Christ, but Dunne does not view desire in mimetic terms
- Dunne speaks as if we have an active, positive agency to desire the good and choose nonviolent desire


### Discussing the positive aspects of mimetic desire and divine grace in human relationships.

**Mimetic Desire**

**Intrinsic Goodness of Mimetic Desire**:
- Even when bad, it is intrinsically good
- Represents extreme openness to others
- Can be the basis for heroism and devotion

**Negative vs. Positive Mimetic Desire**:
- Negative: conflictual, rivalrous, and murderous
- Positive: love, creativity, community

**Mimetic Desire in Literature**:
- Writers are "hypermimetic" - obsessed with negative mimetic desire
- Literature explores evil, not the whole of life

**Desire for the Other**:
- Desiring for the other because of their otherness
- Recapitulates the Golden Rule: desiring what the other desires
- Not colonialist or scapegoating

**Divine Grace and Positive Mimetic Desire**:
- Wherever positive, active desire for the other exists, there is divine grace present
- Denying this moves into optimistic humanism


## Chapter 6 Sacrifice as Sacral Violence and Substitution

Mimetic desire can be channeled through religion and culture, preventing violence if effectively conveyed as non-violent divine imitation (Chapters 5, 11, 12).


### Sacred Violence: Scapegoating, Sacrifice, and Mimetic Desire in Cultural Traditions.

**Cultural Traditions and Sacrifice**
* **Origin of Sacrifice**:
  * Represents disorder and relief from violence in human communities (see chapter 1 and Things Hidden)
  * Double transference: scapegoat effect (disorder/offenses transferred to victim, peace ascribed to him/her)
* **Elements of Sacrifice**:
  * Substitution: animal offered instead of human
  * Misunderstanding/delusion: cultural assumption concealing generative mechanism (see Scapegoat Mechanism)
* **Sacrifice as Sacred Violence** (Violence and the Sacred, 1-18, 39-44):
  * Necessity in cultural systems for maintaining order
  * Role of vengeance: release from conflict and violence
  * Primitive character: precedes emergence of judicial systems
* **Sacrificial Crisis**: when sacrifice fails to distinguish good and bad violence (Violence and the Sacred)
* Girard's perspective on Sacrifice:
  * Preferable to widespread violence (but not solely nonviolent relationships)
  * Nonsacrificial vision held in tension with sacrificial context.


### Sacrifice: Dual Aspects, Criminal and Sacred

**Sacrifice: Dual Aspects and Ambivalence**

**Overview:**
- Sacrifices can have both legitimate and illegitimate aspects
- Henri Hubert and Marcel Mauss' "Essay on the Nature and Function of Sacrifice" explains this duality through the sacred character of the victim

**Sacred Victim:**
- Criminal to kill a sacred victim, but it is sacred only because it is to be killed
- Circular reasoning: victim is sacred because it will be killed, yet killing it is criminal

**Ambivalence:**
- Term often used to describe the conflicting emotions or motives towards sacrifice
- Provides no real explanation for the nature of sacrifice
- Just points out a problem that remains unsolved

**Relation between Sacrifice and Violence:**
- Sacrifice can resemble criminal violence, but also few forms of violence cannot be described in terms of sacrifice
- Tragic poets use rhetoric to veil sordid realities of life

**First Appearances and Symbolism:**
- In the realm of sacrifice, first appearances matter little
- Sacrifice is an essentially symbolic institution that lends itself to insubstantial theorizing
- Contains an element of mystery which remains impenetrable.


### The relationship between violence and sacrifice in human behavior.

**Sacrifice: Exploring the Connection Between Sacrifice, Distraction, Detachment, and Violence**

**Modern Perception of Sacrifice**:
- Difficult to understand true intentions behind sacrifice
- Possible influences: distraction, detachment, secret discretion

**The Relationship between Sacrifice and Violence**:
- Physiology of violence remains consistent across individuals and cultures
- Angry cats or men exhibit similar physiological responses as each other
- Violence is difficult to quell once aroused within the normal social framework

**Violence and Surrogate Victims**:
- When initial object remains out of reach, violence seeks surrogate victims
- Tendency to find surrogate victims not limited to human violence
- Example: Fish species that lack natural enemies turn on their own kind

**Choosing Animal Sacrifice Victims**:
- Animals chosen for sacrifice are often gentle and innocent
- Selected creatures display traits harmonious with humans
- Quoted from Joseph de Maistre and modern ethnology

**Examples of Intuitive Behavior in Pastoral Communities**:
- In pastoral communities where sacrifice is practiced, cattle closely associated with daily life


### The relationship between humans and cattle in Nuer society: symbiotic and valued, leading to substitution in sacrifice.

**The Nuer and Dinka Tribes of the Upper Nile:**
- Maintain a bovine society parallel to their own, structured similarly
- Rich in vocabulary describing cattle (Evans-Pritchard's observations)
- Cattle differentiated by color, shape, age, sex, lineage
- Names given to both humans and cattle based on their similar places in the tribe
- Quarrels involve cattle: fines, interest payments, dowries
- Symbiosis between tribe and cattle (Evans-Pritchard's term)

**Substitution as the Basis for Sacrifice:**
- Prevalent idea in ancient literature on sacrifice
- Evans-Pritchard's "chercher la vache" (look to the cows) to understand Nuer people
- Hubert and Mauss suspect this idea introduces religious values, but propose an alternative:
  - No moral distinction between potential victim and actual victim
  - Society seeks to deflect violence on a relatively indifferent sacrificeable victim instead of its own members.


### Sacrificial substitution in biblical stories: Cain and Abel, Jacob and Esau.

**Sacrificial Motifs in Fairy Tales and Religious Texts**

**Fairy Tales**:
- Wolf, ogre, or dragon gobbles up a large stone in place of a small child
- Sacrificial cast to the story of Cain and Abel
- Violence can be diverted to another object

**Cain and Abel**:
- Difference between sacrificial and nonsacrificial cults
- God's judgment in favor of Abel, whose offerings were accepted
- Cain is a murderer, whereas his brother is not

**Old Testament/Greek Myth**:
- Fatal penchant for violence can only be diverted by the intervention of a third party (the sacrificial victim or victims)
- Cain's "jealousy" of his brother is lack of a sacrificial outlet

**Muslim Tradition**:
- God delivered to Abraham the ram previously sacrificed by Abel
- Ram took the place of Abraham's son Isaac, saving another human life

**Biblical Scene: Jacob and Isaac**:
- Isaac summons Esau to receive final blessing, but requests venison first
- Jacob presents "savory meat" dish made from slaughtered goats, fooling his father
- Jacob receives the blessing intended for Esau

**Explanation of Sacrificial Substitution Theory**:
- No mystical hocus-pocus, but intuitive insight into the function of sacrifice
- Sacrifice allows for the diversion of violence to an external object


### Sacrificial substitution in biblical and mythological narratives. Jacob's deception using animals.

**Sacrificial Substitution in Biblical Narrative**

**Jacob's Deception**:
- Jacob serves two ways to divert father's violence from himself:
  - Presenting slaughtered kids as savory meat to receive blessings instead of curses
  - Seeking refuge in skins of sacrificed animals, acting as insulation between father and son
- Two types of substitution involved:
  1. One brother for another (explicitly recognized)
  2. Animal for man (implicitly projected)

**Sacrificial Rite**:
- Sacrificial substitution requires awareness of original object and transference to surrogate victim
- Narrative touches upon mythic origins of sacrificial system, linking Jacob to Odysseus and the Cyclops episode in Odyssey:
  - Both stories involve ruses enabling heroes to escape violent captors by clinging to animals
  - Comparison lends credence to theory of sacrificial origins.


### Sacrifice: Misunderstood function and the role of illusion in social institutions.

**Sacrifice:**
* Act of mediation between a sacrificer and a deity (outdated perspective)
* Referenced in ancient texts without mention of deities
* Significance diminished by divine intervention
* Misunderstanding essential for the sacrificial process
* Theological basis: god demands victims, savors smoke from altars
* Interpreters may overlook the illusion at their own peril
* Critical examination necessary to understand true role in society.


### Sacrifice: Restoring social harmony by eliminating internal conflict.

**Sacrifice: Uncovering Societal Conflicts**

**Background:**
- Dissect societal conflicts behind sacrificial acts and their interpretations
- Break from traditional formalistic perspective on sacrifice (Hubert & Mauss)

**Modern Interpretation of Sacrifice:**
- Collective substitution performed at the expense of victim, absorbing internal tensions
  - Not a substitute for endangered individual or bloodthirsty temperament
  - Offered up by members of the community to protect entire community from own violence
- Social function independent from theological dimension

**Sacrifice as Collective Substitution:**
- Dinka and Ndembu societies: sacrifice serves to eliminate internal dissensions
  - Victim becomes substitute for all community members
- Protection from own violence, prompting choice of external victims

**The Social Function of Sacrifice:**
- Restores harmony to the community
- Suppresses internal dissensions, rivalries, jealousies, and quarrels
- Common denominator in effectiveness of all sacrifices

**Implications:**
- No aspect of human existence is foreign to this subject
- When men don't live in harmony: less well-tended fields, fewer abundant harvests.


### Sacrifice in ancient societies: uniting society through rituals and preventing violent impulses.

**Sacrifice and Unity in Chinese Culture**
- Sacrificial rites acknowledged for their role in pacifying country and strengthening societal unity (CH'U YU II, 2)
- The Book of Rites: sacrificial ceremonies, music, punishments, and laws all serve the same purpose - to unite society and establish order

**Limitations of Examining Sacrifice Without Ritualistic Context**
- Risk of appearing simplistic or psychologizing
- Ajax's story: mad rage leads him to mistake animals for intended targets; slaughter outside ritual framework labeled as madness
- Myth not about sacrificial process per se but related to its effects and structure

**Human Sacrifice in Greek Society**
- Ancient Greeks utilized animals for sacrifices, but some societies used human victims instead
- In fifth-century Greece: practice continued through pharmakos - a slave or outcast sacrificed during festivals or times of crisis
- Medea's story: human substitute victim in the form of children, parallel to Ajax's tale yet involving human sacrifice

**Sacrifice and Tragedy**
- Euripides' Medea: rage against Jason leads to plan for killing her own children
- Nurse pleads with tutor to keep children away from their enraged mother, fearing they may become her victim
- Reveals the savage nature of human substitution in sacrifice.


### Sacrifice: Redirecting Violence through Human and Animal Offerings.

**Relationship Between Medea's Infanticide and Sacrifice:**
* Medea substitutes her own children as objects of hatred due to unreachable enemy
* Infanticide seen in various cultures, including Jewish and ancient Greek, as ritualistic practice
* Comparison with Ajax's massacre of sheep: both involve substitution and preparation before fateful act
* Sacrifice serves to redirect violence into "proper channels"

**Medea's Infanticide:**
* Difficult to see religious aspect in her behavior
* Infanticide practiced in various cultures as sacrifice
* Medea's children become vicarious victims for unnamed enemy
* Prepares for death of children like a priest preparing for sacrifice
* Ritual announcement made before fateful act

**Connection Between Animal and Human Sacrifice:**
* No essential difference between animal and human sacrifice
* Principle of substitution applies to both human and animal victims when physical resemblance is present
* In some societies, certain categories of humans reserved for sacrificial purposes to protect others
* Gap between societies practicing human sacrifice and those not doing so should not prevent understanding their commonalities.

**Misconceptions About Sacrifice:**
* Reluctance to equate animal with human sacrifice is a misunderstanding persisting in human culture
* Joseph de Maistre's assertion that this principle does not apply to human sacrifice is unsubstantiated.


### Exploring Sacrifice: Human and Animal Victims in Ancient Greek Tragedy and Scholarship

**Human Sacrifice in Ancient Greek Tragedy**

**Contradictions to de Maistre's Assertion**:
- Medea and Electra contradict Gre ek tragedy on the "normal" function of human sacrifice
- Clytemnestra in Euripides' Electra justifies Iphigenia's sacrifice for saving lives

**Modern Scholars' Approach**:
- Rarely mention human sacrifice in theoretical discussions
- Concentrate on its "sadistic" or "barbarous" aspects
- Divide sacrifice into two categories, human and animal
- Value judgment on human victims being unsuitable is questionable

**Approaching the Institution of Sacrifice**:
- Avoid dividing victims into categories
- Treat all victims, human or animal, equally to understand selection criteria
- Recognize that value judgments are arbitrary within the institution

**Resemblance Between Victims**:
- All victims bear a resemblance to the object they replace
- This resemblance should not lead to confusion between humans and animals
- Nuer people do not mistake men for cows in sacrifice

**Modern Perspective on Sacrifice**:
- Not lapsing into "primitive mentality" of Lévy Bruhl
- Moderns are capable of making distinctions as much as primitive people.


### Sacrifice: Outsiders and the Degree of Social Integration.

**Characteristics of Sacrificeable Creatures**

**Human Victims**:
- Must bear a sharp resemblance to excluded human categories
- Maintain degree of difference from sacrificial animals to avoid confusion
- No mistakes allowed in animal sacrifice, unlike human victims

**Marginal Individuals as Sacrifices**:
- Prisoners of war
- Slaves
- Handicapped
- Unmarried adolescents
- Children not yet initiated into society
- Outsiders or enemies to the community

**King as a Sacrifice**:
- Rare, often regulated and ritualistic
- Isolated from fellow men despite central position in society
- Fool serves as foil and potential vent for king's anger

**Explanation for Exclusion of Women as Victims**:
- Women not considered full members of society in some cultures
- Married women retain ties to parents' clan, risking vengeance if killed.


### Sacrifice: Violence without reprisal and societal link to the victim.

**Sacrifice: Understanding Its Essential Characteristic**

**Background:**
- Invariably, sacrificial victims lack a crucial social link to their community
- Freedom from reprisal is essential for the sacrificial process

**Crucial Social Link Missing**:
- Sacrifices can be chosen from various human or animal categories
- Lack of social connection means they cannot retaliate or seek vengeance

**Paradoxical Rituals**:
- Frequent references to vengeance during rituals, despite no chance of revenge
- Participants beseech the entire species not to seek vengeance for victim's death
- Sacrificer is punished as a way to divert internal violent impulses

**Function of Sacrifice**:
- Quells violence within the community and prevents conflicts from erupting
- Societies without obvious sacrificial rites may still benefit from its functions implicitly.


### The role of sacrifice in controlling societal violence and revenge.

**Societal Violence and Sacrifice:**
- **Violence within society**: exists but not catastrophic
- **Disappearance of sacrificial practices**: explains difficulty in understanding their function
- **Difference between primitive societies and modern culture**: fundamental difference hidden by rites, particularly sacrifice
- **Revenge and blood feuds**: virtually nonexistent in modern culture
- **Fundamental difference**: examine specific ailments controlled by sacrifice
- **Reasons for the intolerability of revenge:**
  - Satisfaction comes from spilling the killer's blood
  - No clear distinction between crime and punishment
  - Vengeance perpetuates an interminable, repetitive process
  - Threatens to involve entire social body
  - Prohibition against vengeance strictly enforced but important role in shaping relationships.


### The role of justice systems in limiting vengeance in societies.

**Vengeance: A Complex Sociological Phenomenon**

**Tragedy and Vengeance**
- In Greek tragedy, vengeance is a passionate response depending on the character's position in the drama
- Difficult to theorize about without equivocations or paradoxes due to its profound impact on primitive societies

**The Vicious Circle of Vengeance**
- Effects of vengeance can only be surmised in primitive societies
- Modern society has broken this cycle through our judicial system

**The Role of the Judiciary**
- Limits vengeance to a single act of reprisal by a sovereign authority
- Decisions presented as final word on vengeance
- Public vengeance = exclusive property of well-policed societies, called "judicial system"

**Principles of Justice and Revenge**
- No inherent conflict between the concepts of justice and revenge
- Private or public vengeance: no difference in principle but enormous social difference
- Public system terminates the process, averting danger of escalation

**Absence of Judicial System in Primitive Societies**
- Ethnologists' findings confirm this conclusion
  - Malinowski: "criminal" aspect of law is vague; idea of justice hardly applicable
  - Andaman Islanders had no punishment system by society, only private vengeance sought by injured parties.


### Dispelling myths about justice and revenge in primitive societies

**Anthropologist Robert Lowie's Perspective on Justice in Primitive Societies**

**Types of Societies:**
- Societies with central authority: those that possess a superior tribunal capable of arbitrating between groups
- Societies without central authority: parental group exercises judicial power, faces off like a sovereign state

**Challenges in Primitive Societies:**
- Lack of true "administering of justice" or judicial system
- Blood feuds and perpetual vendettas may arise when an individual injures a member outside their group
- The desire to find virtues equal to our own in controlling violence can lead to minimizing differences

**Example of Misconceptions:**
- Vengeance taking the place of a judicial system where it's lacking (erroneous theory)
- Ignorance of the achievements of a society with a long history of an established judicial system

**Consequences of Vengeance:**
- Unending process that can't restrain violent impulses
- Danger of interminable escalation remains without a sovereign and independent body to take responsibility for revenge.

**Lowie's Observations:**
- In societies with central authority, the lack of an abstract principle of justice is not crucial but the fact that legal reprisals are always in the hands of victims and those near to them.
- Efforts to modify punishment or hold vengeance in check can only result in a precarious situation.


### Sacrifice as a means for maintaining social harmony in societies without a judicial system.

**Sacrifice as an Instrument of Prevention in Primitive Societies**

**The Absence of Formal Justice System**:
- Institutional concepts like "an eye for an eye" or trial by combat are inexact when spoken of as "administering justice"
- Malinowski's conclusion: no tried and true remedies to restore social equilibrium once it is upset

**The Role of Sacrifice**:
- Preventive measure in the struggle against violence
- Polarizes community's aggressive impulses and redirects them towards victims incapable of propagating further vengeance
- Provides an outlet for violent impulses that cannot be mastered by self-restraint
- Efficacy attested by reliable witnesses

**Crisis Situations and Sacrificial Mediation**:
- Social fabric of the community is threatened, dissension and discord are rife
- The more critical the situation, the more "precious" the sacrificial victim must be
- Significance: sacrifice has languished in societies with a firmly established judicial system

**Sacrifice vs. Judicial System**:
- Sacrifice does not replace a judicial system, but is an essential role in societies that lack one
- A judicial system is ultimately irreplaceable, short of a unanimous and voluntary renunciation of all violent actions


### Exploring the delicate balance in sacrificial rituals and their role in society's violence control.

**The Sacrificial Crisis**

**Dangers of Minimizing Vengeance**:
- Risk of losing sight of true function of sacrifice
- Society's ignorance of vengeance leads to false line of thought
- Religion appears senseless as problem is concealed

**Requirements for Sacrificial Process**:
- Complete separation of sacrificed victim from substitute beings
- Similarity between both parties

**Challenges to Sacrificial Structure**:
- Changes in hierarchical classification of living creatures
- Repeated sacrifice brings about change and inability to adapt

**Consequences of Sacrificial Ineffectiveness**:
- Violence is not eliminated; conflicts within the community multiply
- Gap between victim and community grows too wide, leading to loss of similarity
- Victim no longer attracts violent impulses, sacrifices become ineffective

**Importance of Balance and Adaptation**:
- Delicately balanced mechanism of associations required
- Religion's inability to adapt can lead to decay or insignificance
- Failure to address issues can result in "impure" violence mingling with sacred rites.


### Heracles' Sacrifice: Violence Goes Wrong and Turns Against Family

**The Failure of a Sacrifice: The Tragic Tale of Heracles**

**Overview**:
- Play explores the failure of a sacrifice
- Heracles' return home finds family under threat, leading to violent outburst during preparation for self-purification ritual

**Heracles' Downfall**:
- Returns home after labors to find wife and children under usurper Lycus
- Believes they are enemies, sacrifices them in madness
- Mistake attributed to goddess Lyssa acting on behalf of Iris and Hera

**Significance of Ritual**:
- Preparations for sacrifice provide setting for violent outburst
- Euripides highlights ritualistic origins of Heracles' actions

**Amphitryon's Explanation**:
- Asks Heracles about cause of "horror"
- Suggests madness struck near altar during self-purification rites

**Effectiveness of Sacrifice**:
- Heracles' sacrifice fails to draw off violence, instead unleashes flood of impure violence on victims
- Difference between sacrificial and nonsacrificial violence is arbitrary

**Purification Rituals**:
- Experts must purify themselves after decontaminating installations (like atomic power plants) due to risk of accidents
- Sacrificial violence can serve as an agent for purification when circumstances allow.


### Heracles' return home: Tragedies of sacrifices gone wrong and violence.

**The Motif of the Sacrifice Gone Wrong**

**Heracles' Story**:
- Heracles mortally wounded Nessus, a centaur who assaulted his wife Deianira
- Nessus gave Deianira a shirt smeared with his sperm (or blood mixed with Hydra's blood)
- Deianira sent the shirt to Heracles as a welcoming gift
- Heracles put on the shirt, which activated the poison and caused him to end his life on a pyre
- The servant who delivered the shirt was killed by Heracles

**Sacrifice Motifs**:
- **Impurity**: Heracles, as a returning warrior, was tainted with the impurity of war
- **Violence Invading the Heart of the City**: The initial murder of Lycus in Euripides' play corresponds to the death of the old servant in Sophocles' play
- **Good Violence Turning Bad**: The mythological accompaniments (Lyssa, the goddess of madness, and Nessus's shirt) add a veil that reveals the same theme: "good" violence turning into "bad"

**The Warrior's Return Myth**:
- Not strictly mythological, but readily incorporates the motif of sacrificial rites going wrong


### Tragedies and ritual purification: Transition from archaic religion to statism

**Ritual and Sociological/Psychological Interpretations**
* Ritualistic action is primitive and open to all ideological interpretations, but dependent on none
* Prevents resurgence of violence in community
* Significance lies in its impact on the entire community, not just individuals

**Greek Tragedy and Religious Crisis**
* Greek tragedy belonged to a period of transition between archaic theocracy and modern order based on statism and laws
* Archaic order's stability came from religious element, sacrificial rites
* Pre-Socratics, philosophers of classical tragedy, discussed decay of sacrificial rites and their inability to purify what is impure

**Heraclitus Fragment (5th Fragment)**
* Deals with the decline of sacrificial rites and their inability to cleanse what is unclean
* Criticizes those who attempt purification through bloodshed as foolish
* Religious beliefs compromised by decadent state of ritual

**Comparison to Old Testament Prophets**
* Pre-exilian prophets (Amos, Isaiah, Micah) denounced impotence of sacrificial process and ritual in general.


### Greek tragedy and the declining role of sacrifice in ancient society.

**Impact of Sacrificial Practices on Greek Society**

**Decay of Religious Practices**:
- Inevitably linked to deterioration of contemporary behavior
- Eroding of the sacrificial system results in emergence of reciprocal violence

**Empedocles' Purifications**:
- Neighbors sacrificing one another after previously joining together in sacrifice of an "outside" victim
- Father killing son, children murdering mother

**Sacrificial Crisis in Greek Tragedy**:
- Sacrificial religion provides language for these dramas
- Criminal seen as performer of sacrifices, not rightor of wrongs
- Viewed from perspective of new, emergent order, not old order in final stages of decay

**Modern Approach to Sacrifice**:
- Difficulty understanding the practice's function
- Lack of attribution of real function leads to difficulty determining disintegration process

**Greek Tragedians' Perspective**:
- Viewed sacrificial crisis through lens of legendary figures, not historical prophets
- Images reflect contemporary scene but are unclear, like viewing through a glass darkly
- Each play deals with collapse of royal house, suggesting larger issue for the entire community.


## Chapter 7 The Scapegoat as Historical Referent

Myths mask scapegoating as they establish patterns of meaning; however, their fantastic elements have real-world roots (Girard).


### A medieval poem on scapegoating and societal crises: Guillaume de Machaut's "Judgment of the King of Navarre". The text describes a social crisis with mass violence against Jews, leaving readers questioning historical facts versus mythical elements.

**The Scapegoat: A Social Crisis and Collective Violence**

**Referents**:
- Social or cultural crisis
- Collective violence against a victim(s)
- Victims blamed for the crisis and credited with restoring peace and harmony through lynching

**Guillaume de Machaut's "Judgment of the King of Navarre" as a Test Case**:
- Fourteenth-century text used to demonstrate the similarities between texts justifying persecution and myths
- Describes a severe crisis and massacre of Jews, blamed for causing the plague

**Key Elements in Guillaume's Text**:
- Unbelievable mythical elements, such as:
  - Signs in the sky
  - People knocked down by rain of stones
  - Entire cities destroyed by lightning
- Descriptions of mass deaths due to Jewish poisoning of drinking water
- Heavenly intervention leading to the identification and massacre of evildoers
- Gradual return to normalcy, signaled by music and laughter in the streets

**Historical Context**:
- Modern skepticism towards historical certainty and reliance on texts
- Epistemological and philosophical crisis undermining historical science
- Despite these doubts, contemporary readers may still find real events within Guillaume's text


### Medieval fear: Plague and scapegoating of Jews described in historical texts.

**Impact of Fear on Medieval Society**

**Fear of Plague**:
- People were afraid to mention the word "plague"
- Avoided taking necessary precautions due to fear of aggravating the epidemic
- Desperate desire to deny the evidence contributed to search for "scapegoats"

**Collective Bad Faith**:
- Recognized the plague as a divine punishment
- Identified the guilty and punished them, or "dedicated" them to the god

**The Judgment of the King of Navarre**:
- Describes the massacre of the Jews during the plague outbreak
- Accused the Jews of poisoning rivers and fountains, causing thousands of deaths
- Resulted in the destruction, imprisonment, or execution of the Jewish population

**La Fontaine's Fable "Animals Sickened by the Plague"**:
- Describes the process of collective bad faith where people refused to name the plague
- Introduces the idea that the angry god was annoyed by a guilt that was not equally shared
- Identified the least protected creature, the ass, as the one to be designated for punishment


### Medieval account of the plague: Scapegoating Jews or a linguistic scapegoat?

**Massacres of Jews during the Plague Epidemic**
- Some cities, Jews were massacred due to mere mention of plague being in area (before it had arrived)
- Guillaume's account could fit this phenomenon as massacre occurred before height of epidemic

**Poisoning Claims vs. Reality**
- Number of deaths attributed to Jews poisoning suggests another explanation
- If deaths are real, they might have been the first victims of plague
- Guillaume does not recognize plague as a pathological phenomenon initially
- Only recognizes it later due to overwhelming disaster
- Casts doubt on single explanation of conspiracy of poisoners

**Poet's Recognition of Plague**
- Poet avoids using the fatal word "plague" until very end
- Introduces Greek word "epydime," which was uncommon at time, as a new way to refer to it
- Word does not function as synonym but as euphemism to avoid saying plague directly
- Refusal to name plague leads to belief in control and dedication of plague to god

**Scientific Perspective vs. Public Opinion**
- Guillaume prefers referring to public opinion rather than thinking for himself about the nature of disease
- The word "epydime" had scientific flavor that helped ward off anxiety
- Renaming plague as a way to create the illusion of control over uncontrollable phenomenon.


### Understanding Guillaume's text: Separating fact from perception despite historical ambiguity.

**Interpretation of Guillaume's Text**

**Understanding Guillaume's Perspective**:
- Author sees disasters as independent, linked only by religious significance
- Unaware of "Black Death" as single entity

**Modern Perception vs. Author's Understanding**:
- Modern readers perceive author's text differently
- Believe they have discovered a truth not seen by the author
- Confident in statement that Jews were really massacred

**Source of Modern Confidence**:
- Other texts from same period provide historical context
- Known facts about anti-Semitic persecutions during plague
- Framework of historical knowledge arouses certain expectations

**Limitations of Historical Context**:
- Documents used are no more reliable than Guillaume's text
- Lack of specific information on location of events
- Modern reader still concludes there were probably victims unjustly massacred
- Distinguishes true from false in the text.


### Analyzing the relationship between fact and fiction in a historical text.

**Discerning Truth from Uncertainty in Historical Texts: The Case of Guillaume de Machaut's Poem**

**Background:**
- Incompatible elements in text: credible vs. incredible
- Initial difficulty distinguishing true from false
- Implicit acknowledgement of interaction between likely and unlikely characteristics

**Skepticism**:
- Outright skepticism disregards real nature of text
- Suspicion of author's prejudices and naïveté
- Historical knowledge uncertain, but not to be discarded entirely

**Characteristics of the Text:**
- Likely characteristics: credible themes, public opinion easily excitable
- Incredible characteristics: unbelievable stories, author's hatred for supposedly guilty people

**Interplay between Credibility and Imagination:**
- In a context of improbable events, possible becomes probable
- Reverse is also true: probable events hide unlikely ones
- Textual representations confirm each other

**Explanation for Correspondence:**
- Rooted in real persecution described from perspective of persecutors
- Perspective deceptive but somewhat reliable due to belief in righteousness

**Guillaume de Machaut's Text**:
- Suspected author of massacres, not entirely unreliable
- Worth more than least reliable feature if rooted in real events.


### Medieval persecution texts: Unlikely accusations confirm historical reality.

**Persecution Texts:**

**Characteristics of Texts Describing Persecutions:**
- Describe circumstances favorable to persecution
- Present victims that persecutors usually choose
- Represent victims as guilty of crimes commonly attributed by persecutors
- Improbable accusations strengthen probability of massacres
- Confirm psychosocial context within which massacres must have taken place

**Perceptions of Persecutors:**
- Potential persecutors describe reality of their persecutions
- Should be believed due to frequency and consistency in characteristics
- Interaction between probable and improbable aspects explains each other
- Statistical verifiability does not rely on uncertain documents alone.

**Interpretation of Texts:**
- Modern Western world interprets "texts of persecution" as real
- Solution is accurate and perfect, making allowances for all characteristics
- Based on solid intellectual reasoning rather than humanitarianism or ideology.


### Analysis of medieval persecution texts: Value of unreliable accounts and the role of the referent

**Social Historian's Perspective:**
- Reliable testimony of persecutors reveals more due to unconscious nature (contrast to modern persecutors)
- Naïve persecutors: unaware they are perpetrating crimes, present things as they see them
- Commonplace facts about Guillaume de Machaut's work may be inconceivable to some critics

**Textual Interpretation:**
- Respecting the meaning of texts vs. doing violence to them
- The referent: subject of text (in this case, massacre of Jews) is important and accessible for understanding

**Persecution Texts:**
- Accounts of real violence from the perspective of persecutors with characteristic distortions
- Identify and correct distortions to reveal arbitrary nature of perpetrated violence

**Witch Trials:**
- Combination of fact and fiction present in trials, not all false but not deserving of death sentence
- Accused may believe they are witches and have caused harm, but magic is not effective

**Critical Perspective:**
- Some critics dismiss the referent as unimportant or inaccessible
- Focus on ambiguous relationships of language instead
- Importance of understanding persecution texts to reveal arbitrary nature of violence.


### Historical analysis of witchcraft trials: credibility of improbable details.

**Interpreting Historical Texts: Witchcraft Trials and Persecutions**

**The Problem of Witchcraft Beliefs**:
- Belief in witchcraft held by judges, witnesses, and accused does not affect our interpretation
- Skepticism is not shaken despite unanimous agreement among parties involved
- Historians can dispute the sentences pronounced on witches centuries later

**Reinterpreting Texts: Guillaume de Machaut as an Example**:
- Same extreme reinterpretation and audacity in overthrowing text
- Details imagined do not persuade us to consider the whole text imaginary
- Incredible accusations strengthen credibility of other facts
- Paradoxical relationship between probable and improbable details

**Legal Documents as Historically Reliable Sources**:
- Legal documents can yield positive or more positive results than non-legal texts
- Confidence is generally well-placed due to careful editing and clarity
- Historian's rejection of believable data on ground of distrust is not effective criticism

**The Golden Rule of Persecution Texts**:
- Mind of a persecutor creates certain type of illusion
- Traces of their illusion confirm, rather than invalidate, the existence of the persecution itself


### A summary of stereotypical forms of persecution described in "The Scapegoat" by J.W.

**Understanding Stereotypes of Persecution**

**Stereotyping**:
- Stereotypes are clear marks of a stereotype
- Identifying true from false is simple
- Reasons for assurance in persecution texts: description and understanding of stereotypes

**Sketch of Stereotypes**:
- Overview of stereotypes of persecution
- Summary of systematic understanding previously unexamined
- Understanding captive to concrete examples within Western historical domain
- Expanding application beyond the "ethnological universe"

**Typology of Persecution Stereotypes**:
- Sketch provided in chapter 2 of "The Scapegoat"
- Detailed description forthcoming.

*This summary is an approximation based on the given text, condensed for clarity and ease of understanding.*


## Chapter 8 Stereotypes of Persecution

**Stereotypes of Persecution**

**Girard's "Grammar" of Persecution**:
- Crisis of the loss of necessary distinctions for social order
- Accusations against victims onto whom crimes are transferred
- Signs of victims: weak/marginal within system, or foreigners outside it

**Collective Persecutions**:
- Acts of violence committed directly by a mob (e.g., persecution of Jews during Black Death)

**Collective Resonances of Persecutions**:
- Legal in form but stimulated by public opinion (e.g., witch-hunts)

**Distinction between Persecutions and Resonances**:
- Not essential, as some events can belong to both types

**Causes of Persecutions**:
- External: epidemic, drought, famine, etc.
- Internal: political disturbances, religious conflicts

**Importance of Understanding Persecutions**:
- Often occur during times of crisis, weakening normal institutions
- Mobs can exert decisive influence on weakened institutions or even replace them entirely


### Collapse of social order: Institutional differences vanish in crisis situations.

**The Experience of Great Collective Persecutions:**
* Loss of social order leads to disappearance of rules defining cultural divisions
* Strongest impression: extreme confusion, reduction to ruin, absence of difference
* Description found in great writers and individuals with no literary pretensions
* Examples from Thucydides, Sophocles, Lucretius, Boccaccio, Shakespeare, Defoe, Thomas Mann, Antonin Artaud, Fco de Santa Maria

**Institutional Collapse:**
* Obliterates hierarchical and functional differences
* Everything has monotonous and monstrous aspect
* Real diversity and concealed reciprocal elements revealed

**Breakdown of Society:**
* Time sequences shorten: acceleration of positive exchanges, increase in negative exchanges
* Negative reciprocity brings people into opposition but makes conduct uniform
* Predominance of the same.


### Social crisis causing uniformity through stereotypical persecution and violence.

**Characteristics of Crisis and Persecution:**
- Paradoxical: both conflictual and solipsistic
- Lack of differentiation corresponds to human relations reality but remains mythic
- Absolute experience in modern times, projected onto the whole universe
- Uniformity created through reciprocity
  - Drowning in moral sadness
  - Reduction to an extreme
- Social crisis not affected by diversity of causes
- Stereotype of crisis: eclipse of culture and powerlessness
- Tendency to explain social crisis by social or moral causes
- Suspects blamed for particular categories of crimes

**Accusations in Collective Persecution:**
- Violent crimes against supreme authority figures (e.g., kings, fathers)
- Attacks on weakest and most defenseless, especially young children
- Sexual crimes: rape, incest, bestiality

**Understanding the Process of Persecution:**
- Cultural eclipse causes disconnection from natural causes
- Tendency to blame society or other people for crisis
- Suspects accused of particular categories of crimes.


### The text discusses the mechanisms of persecution in societies during times of cultural crisis. It explains how the crowd becomes a mob and searches for accessible causes of violence, often focusing on transgressions of strict societal taboos.

**Societal Transgressions and Persecution**

**Frequently Invoked Crimes**:
- Transgress taboos considered strictest in society
- Attack foundation of cultural order: family, hierarchical differences
- Correspond to consequences of epidemic disasters
- Total destruction of social bond

**Perpetrators and Beliefs**:
- Seen as extremely harmful to society
- Accusations justify belief in their harmfulness
- Bridge gap between individual insignificance and societal enormity
- Must attack community directly or begin destruction within own sphere

**Causes of Belief**:
- Unconscious desires (psychoanalytic perspective)
- Secret will to oppress (Marxist concept)
- Immediate and obvious causes sufficient for understanding system

**Terror and Crowd Behavior**:
- Undifferentiated community, lacking distinguishing features
- Seeks action but cannot affect natural causes
- Looks for accessible cause to appease violent appetite
- Potential persecutors dream of purging impure elements
- Mobilization: military operation against identified enemy


### Poison accusations in witch trials: scapegoats for societal disasters

**Stereotypical Accusations During the Plague**
- **Accusations against Jews and other scapegoats:** stereotypes of poisoning water, dismissal of improbable accusations
- **Moderation in Guillaume de Machaut's perspective:** belief in occult forces diminishing, intellectual development, focus on rational crimes with material causes
- **Poisoning as a substitute for magic:** weighted down by materiality and "scientific" logic, objective remains the same: lay responsibility for disasters on individuals not proven criminal
- **Chemistry takes over from demoniac influence:** material cause instead of mythical explanation
- **The need for scapegoats:** proof of guilt not dependent on physical presence, participation in criminal assemblies can be spiritual
- **Stereotypical accusations and the sabbat:** nocturnal participation in criminal activities with wide-ranging social repercussions: abominations, infanticide, religious profanation, incestuous relationships, bestiality, food poisoning, offenses against influential or prestigious citizens.

**Understanding Stereotypical Accusations:**
- Variation of a need to blame others for societal disasters
- Conviction of small groups or individuals causing harm to the whole society without being discovered
- Material cause substitutes mythical explanations: poisoning instead of witchcraft
- Belief in the objective, even if less mythical, nature of these accusations
- Connection to crisis of undifferentiation and stereotyping.


### Universal signs for selecting social victims: ethnicity, religion, and physical or mental abnormalities.

**Stereotypes and Victim Selection:**

**Random vs. Targeted Victims:**
- Crowds may choose victims randomly or based on certain criteria
- Not necessarily only accused of crimes they've committed
- Perpetrators might target vulnerable groups for persecution

**Universal Stereotypes:**
- Ethnic and religious minorities often subjected to discrimination
  - Jews, Moslems, Hindus, etc.
- Transcultural criterion for victim selection

**Physical Criteria:**
- Sickness, madness, genetic defects, injuries, disabilities
- Polarize persecutors against victims
- Universal signifiers of a victim

**Discrimination Against Handicapped Individuals:**
- Labeled as 'handicapped' instead of abnormal or disabled
- Subject to discriminatory measures in society
- Disproportionate impact on social exchange

**Interchangeable Victims:**
- Difficulty adapting, orphans, penniless individuals, etc.
- Tendency for primitive people to polarize against the afflicted person
- Abnormality need not be only physical.


### Social Persecution: Crowds and the Marginalized, Rich Included

**Abnormality as a Criterion for Persecution**
- **Abnormal behavior or status may function as criterion for persecution**
- In social hierarchy, average defines the norm
- Further from normal social status, greater risk of persecution
  - Examples: poor and outside rs, rich and powerful

**Double Marginality and Social Turmoil**
- **Rich and powerful** can be victims of collective destruction
- Double marginality: socially excluded yet privileged
- Normal times, rich and powerful enjoy protection, privileges
- In times of crisis, odds of violent death greater for privileged than other categories
- Extreme characteristics attract collective destruction (wealth/poverty, success/failure, beauty/ugliness, vice/virtue)
- Weakness of marginalized groups becomes weakness in face of crowd
- Crowds commonly turn on those who held exceptional power over them

**Borderline Between Discrimination and Persecution**
- Reasonable discrimination vs. arbitrary persecution
- Historical examples: Quarantine during epidemics, doctors' opposition to contagion theory in the Middle Ages
- Contagion theory eventually established as a purely medical concept in 19th century after being free of association with persecution.


### Examining patterns of collective violence and its stereotypical victims, using historical examples.

**Understanding Collective Violence: Persecution Patterns Across Cultures**

**Importance of Pattern Recognition**
- Not seeking to set exact boundaries for persecution
- Interest lies in showing pattern's existence and relevance

**Analysis of Two Examples:**
1. **Marie Antoinette's Execution:**
   - Queen and foreigner: categories of victims of persecution
   - Popular accusations against her include Austrian origin
   - Court influenced by Paris mob: stereotype present
   - Other stereotypes present despite historical context
2. **Black Male Raping White Female:**
   - Collective violence appears less arbitrary, yet distortions persist
   - Perpetrator's actions sanctioned, but stereotypes still significant
   - Causal link between collective situation and individual transgression inverts relationship
   - Mentality of the persecutor moves from collective to individual reversely.


### Differences within and outside systems: Victimization and elimination of distinctions.

**Stereotypes and Victim Blaming**

**Relationship between Stereotypes:**
- First two stereotypes reflect global level and individual's responsibility for harm
- Victims accused of crimes that eliminate distinctions, even if not real
- Third type relates to first two through cultural differences and feelings of otherness

**Cultural Differences:**
- Individuals feel different from others within every culture
- Glorification of difference is an abstract expression of common outlook
- Existence of a tendency to think oneself extremely different

**Victim Selection:**
- Signs indicate victim's selection based on differences outside the system
- Disabilities and monstrous combinations of differences are threatening
- Efforts to limit disturbing dynamism are unsuccessful
- Differences that exist outside the system reveal system's relativity, fragility, and mortality.

**Victim Crimes:**
- Religious, ethnic, or national minorities not reproached for difference but for lack of expected distinctness
- Foreigners accused of lacking culture or taste, difficulty perceiving differences
- Barbarians are those who mix significant distinctions instead of appreciating them.


### Persecution rooted in fear of absent differences, not diversity.

**Prejudice and Hatred: Perpetuated Mechanisms of the Past**

**Expression of Hatred:**
- Expressed towards absence of difference, not for difference itself
- Seen as anomaly or abnormality
- Examples: anti-Americanism, xenophobia

**Mechanisms Reproduced:**
- Unconsciously from generation to generation
- Often at a less lethal level than in the past

**Modern Pluralism:**
- Belief that "difference" is persecuted
- Illusion of cultural freedom and openness
- Fear of compromising this illusion leads to persecution

**Stereotypes of Persecution:**
- Direction remains the same
- Embodied by same stereotypes
- Response to threat of lack of difference

**Relationship between Collective Persecutions and Culture:**
- Connection not fully explained by linguists, philosophers or politicians
- Implies concealed relationship between persecutors and culture as a whole.


## Chapter 9 Python and His Two Wives An Exemplary Scapegoat Myth

Venda myth of Python and his two wives: a case study in witchcraft persecution (Girard)


### Myths reveal scapegoating: disorder, victimization, and communal reconciliation.

**Mimetics Theory and Myths**

**Theories:**
- Reflects a contagious process of disorder culminating in victim's death or expulsion
- Disorders intensify until community polarizes against random victim
- Scapegoat mechanism not understood by society

**Components of Myths:**
1. **Theme of Disorder/Undifferentiation**:
   - May express mimetic disturbances in the community
   - Can range from cosmic catastrophe to minor disruption
2. **Scapegoat Identification**:
   - One individual convicted of fault causing catastrophic consequences for society (scapegoat projection)
   - Preferential signs of victimage may facilitate scapegoat identification
3. Scapegoaters don't acknowledge their own scapegoating behavior in modern sense.
4. Indirect clues are used to identify scapegoating in myths instead of direct verification.
5. The role of scapegoat in these texts should not be refuted as absence of scapegoat theme but understood genetically for maintaining peace within a society.


### Scapegoat myths: violent elimination of troublemakers restores peace and order.

**Scapegoating: A Mimetic Crisis Response**

**Characteristics of Victim Selection**:
- Objective arbitrariness
- Mythical scape goats are physically, morally, or socially impaired
- Can be strangers, cripples, outcasts, persons of low/high standing

**Scapegoating Process**:
1. **Victim is identified and selected**: often triggered by mimetic crisis
2. **Violence against the victim**: elimination by community or individual
3. **Peace returns after violence**: order is (re)generated, projected onto scapegoat
4. **Second transference of the sacred**: victim becomes savior of the community

**Example from Venda Mythology**:
- **Python, the water snake**, had two wives
  - First wife knew truth, second did not
- **Crisis**: rivers dried up when second wife discovers truth
- **Scapegoating**: woman designated as second wife is scape goat, drowns in beer offering rite
  - Death presents as sacrificial rite, punishes offender and appeases god
- **Double transference of the sacred**: victim becomes savior with beloved husband, Python


### Scapegoating and Myth: Real Victims and Droughts

**Understanding Scapegoating in Mythology: The Case of a Female Victim**

**Identification of the Victim**:
- Female, second wife, hierarchically inferior to first wife
- Preferential signs of victimhood, not necessarily spectacular

**Causes and Ending of Drought**:
- Belief that drought is caused by misconduct of second wife with her husband
- Death of the victim ends the drought
- Real drought may have coincided with natural end of the drought

**Interpretation of Myth**:
- Conjunction of mimetic reconciliation against scapegoat and natural end of drought led to memorable episode of scapegoating
- Critics dismiss interpretation as irresponsible due to the fantastic aspect of myth, such as:
  - Divine snake causing drought because of wife's excessive curiosity
  - Non-referentiality of these themes in the context of the story

**Limitations and Challenges**:
- Interpretation may be dismissed by some as theoretically impossible
- Extratextual information from such a myth may seem unlikely due to its nonsensical elements


### Exploring exceptions to the law of unbelievable myths' contamination: Scapegoating and medieval texts.

**The Law of Contamination by the Unbelievable**

**Background:**
- Critics agree that no text can be more reliable than its least reliable components (law of contamination)
- Author violates this law in interpreting foundational myths as exceptions

**Exceptions to the Law:**
1. Collective persecution texts:
   - Stereotyped modalities of collective persecution
   - Unbelievable features presented as solid evidence against victims
2. The Scapegoat (book by the author):
   - Authors mistake unbelievable for truth due to scapegoating of victims
   - Modern historians understand the reason for authors' credulity
   - Blindness does not extend to all data in text, especially violent consequences
3. Similarities between myths and scapegoat texts:
   - Reflect mimetic polarization

**Author's Interpretation:**
- Understanding these texts requires recognizing that authors mistake unbelievable for truth due to scapegoating of victims (mimetic polarization)
- Violent consequences reported in the text are likely true, despite other potentially unreliable information.


### Exploring the origins of a myth through the lens of witchcraft accusation and mimetic rivalry between wives.

**Myth Analysis: Witchcraft Accusation**

**Background:**
- Confusing at first but clarified through witchcraft accusation perspective
- Rivalry between two wives

**First Wife:**
- Initial accuser in the affair
- Feels humiliated and envious of second wife
- More authority and power within household and community
- Unsuccessful in preventing husband's affairs with second wife
- Believes her husband is a divine being, only informed by herself
- Discovery of husband's "divinity" may be a mythical reading of mimetic rivalry

**Second Wife:**
- Attractive and younger than first wife
- Initially legitimate as wife but cannot be indicted for being favorite
- Eventually discovers husband's true nature, leading to surrender and adoption of rival's spirit.

**Mimetic Theory:**
- Explains the divine status of husband as a result of mimetic rivalry between wives
- Wives' obstacles in each other's paths escalate husband's value, making him seem divine
- Jealousy drives first wife to label husband as a divinity and keep it secret from second wife.

**Analysis:**
- Myth seems to express malevolent fantasizing of mimetic rivalry triggered by husband's preference for younger wife.
- Rivalry escalates to the point where both wives view husband as divine, with first wife believing she is the only one informed about it.


### Scapegoat interpretation of a myth: linking natural disasters and accusations

**Understanding Myths: The Case of a Drought Myth**

**Background:**
- Elders passed down a myth about a drought
- Two wives involved: one primary, one secondary
- Wives' relationship linked to the cause of drought

**Analysis:**
1. **Scapegoating**:
   - Second wife insignificant but linked to drought
   - First wife's jealousy creates scapegoat effect
   - Community obsession with victims and accusations in times of crisis
2. **Reversal of Cause and Effect:**
   - Mythical sequence is a scapegoat-inspired reversal
3. **Coherence and Significance:**
   - All themes fit together, confirming scapegoat interpretation
4. **Role of the Snake God:**
   - Fits perfectly with rivalry of two women
   - Killing of victim ends drought
5. **Magical Accusations:**
   - Myth handles snake god as if it were true
6. **Suspension of Law of Contamination:**
   - Scapegoat hypothesis works too well to be rejected
7. **Consensus and Belief:**
   - Entire community believes in the myth as consensus
8. **Value from Extratextual Information:**
   - Myth not necessarily valueless based on scapegoat reading.


### Analyzing myths: Separating fact from fantasy in medieval witch hunts and Venda myths

**Scapegoating in Mythology: Venda Myth as a Magical Accusation**

**The Scapegoat Hypothesis**:
- The second wife is the target of a scapegoat polarization
- Probability of real victim treated like myth's mythical one is high
- Scapegoaters cannot distinguish truth from falsehood
- Myth-makers are deluded scapegoaters, similar to medieval witch hunters

**Sorting Believable from Unbelievable**:
- Fantastic theme in Venda myth becomes a magical accusation
- Keeps fantastic data separate from non-fantastic themes
- Prevents fantastic data from contaminating credibility of believable information
- Similar to how readers of medieval texts discount magical themes

**Applying Mimetic Theory**:
- Viewing Venda myth as a European text in medieval language
- Eliminate beer offering, flute playing, and snake as legitimate husband/divinity
- Turn snake into demon/devil
- Witchcraft accusation against woman making love to devil leads to drowning
- Death of witch seen as beneficial to community, like in the myth

**Conclusion**:
- Transfiguration principle is the same as medieval witch hunting
- Fire or drowning used for witches, with belief in their positive impact on community


### Comparing witch hunts in myths versus historical records: reality versus fantasy contexts.

**Myth vs. Historical Text: Scapegoating**

**Differences between Myths and Medieval Texts:**
- **Fantastic Material**: Myths contain more fantastic and less circumscribed material than medieval texts.
- **Language**: The language in myths is more alien to our rationality than that of medieval texts.

**Similarities:**
- Similar themes and their structural arrangement in both types of texts.

**Interpretation Differences:**
- Our knowledge of the "witchcraft epidemic" in medieval Europe helps us interpret the texts as traces of scapegoat persecution.
- Lack of historical background for most myths prevents similar interpretation.

**Scapegoating Theory Application:**
- Inside our culture: Interpreted as real victims and violence they suffered.
- Outside our culture: Questioned due to fantasic material and lack of contextual information.

**Myth Origins:**
- Societies from which myths originate have little known historical background.

**Medieval Europe Context:**
- Great deal of historical background available for interpretation.

**Interpretation Challenges:**
- Differences in knowledge about the societies and cultures where these texts originate make it difficult to apply scapegoat theory consistently.


### Myth interpretation and fear of witchcraft: context's impact on belief and reliability.

**The Willingness to Interpret Mythical Texts as Witch-Hunting Narratives**

**Magical Accusations**:
- Not explicitly mentioned by students of mythology
- Depends on general awareness of rampant fear of witchcraft during the time period

**Historical Context and Reliability of Texts**:
- Lack of specific historical information can lead to misinterpretations
- Medieval context provides no new information beyond what is available in myth-making societies
- Presence of fantastic elements may increase, rather than decrease, the reliability of a text's account of actual events
- The credulity of the author suggests a community mood conducive to violence against the victims

**Fear of Witchcraft**:
- Does not need to reach acute levels for myth creation
- Assumption that this fear was present in societies from which myths originate is reasonable

**Venda Myth and Witchcraft Accusations**:
- Magic is an important part of the Venda belief system
- Witchcraft accusations are widespread and a major cause of violent crime today


### Exploring the significance of conjunctions in myths and historical texts: Magic accusations and belief suspension.

**Importance of Conjunction of MESS and Medieval Texts**
- **Conjunction of themes** too significant to be fortuitous
- More examples = less likely fortuitous

**Historians vs. Myth Interpreters**
- Difference not in texts, but willingness to consider scapegoat explanation
- Historians: open to real victims behind texts
- Myth interpreters: unwilling to entertain possibility

**Historian's Certainty**
- Criticized for "sloppy handling" and "credulity" by skeptics
- Need to demonstrate solid foundation for reaching real dramas behind texts
- Suspension or reversal of the law of contamination by fantastic themes.

**Venda Myth as Magical Accusation**
- Long first paragraph: accusation of first wife
- Other themes (drought, drowning) made more believable
- Law of contamination reversed: fantastic theme increases likelihood of real referent.


### Historical reality and believability of fantastical accusations in texts.

**The Coherence of Interpreting Myths:**
- The drought provides an ideal terrain for the first wife's accusation (believability)
- Drowning of woman and beneficial consequences also become more believable with this interpretation
- Believability adds up to a coherent interpretation, but not absolute truth according to anti-referential critics
- Interpretive pluralism is rejected as absurd and dangerous in this domain

**Historical Certainty:**
- Historical reality of victims mentioned in unreliable texts (Jews and non-Jews during Black Death) is a historical certainty
- Untrustworthiness of authors increases probability that they are speaking the truth due to crowd's demand for violence against presumed culprits.

**Specific Nature of Believable and Unbelievable Data:**
- Believable data in texts at issue: descriptions of human beings reacting with hysteria and violence
- Unbelievable data in texts: fantastic accusations against witches or Jews during plague epidemics.

**The Logic of Fantastic Accusation:**
- Crowd's demand for violence against presumed culprits leads to predictable consequences
- When found in a text, this logic is assumed to correspond to real sequences of events.


### The reliability of multiple texts reporting witchcraft accusations and violence.

**Text Analysis: Witchcraft Accusations**

**Reliability of Texts**:
- Two types of texts:
  - Rational account without witchcraft accusations
  - Account with typical witchcraft accusations
- Reliability relative to the reported affair:
  - Rational author may be less reliable than second author
  - Second author is more reliable due to mutual fit between attitude and reported events

**Motive for Unreliability**:
- Author's mental attitude and mood aligned with judges or violent mob
- Reveals surrender to "spirit of the mob"
- Makes authors unreliable individuals but good informants on witchcraft effects

**Skepticism and Certainty**:
- Probability of truth is high, but not absolute
- Uncertainty turns into certainty with large number of texts
- Certainty in case of epidemic of witch-hunting at end of Middle Ages
- Large number of texts too similar in themes and structures for chance or fabrication


### Historical analysis of myths: Scapegoating and witchcraft themes in Venda and Oedipus myths.

**Scapegoating in Texts**

**Hypotheses**:
- Forgery, poetic imagination, or other explications cannot satisfactorily account for the vast number of texts with tell-tale signs of scapegoating
- Individual doubts regarding each text do not add up to a statistically significant doubt about the whole

**Scapegoat Phenomena**:
- The most rational hypothesis is that most of these texts reflect scapegoat phenomena triggered by the last convulsions of magical thought at the end of the Middle Ages
- Historians regard these texts as trustworthy, not individually but in their mass, statistically
- No motivation to hide violence against victims from each other or us, as they believed the violence was justified

**Mythology**:
- Applicable to myths as well - some may contain themes arranged in a way that could be tell-tale signs of scapegoating
- Traces of scapegoating often more confusing in myth than in medieval texts
- Lack of historical background makes extending the historical decryption to myths intimidating, but this is a minor obstacle

**Structural Regularity**:
- The structure of mythical etiological narratives makes it difficult to doubt that the mechanism at work in medieval witch-hunting is also at work in all such myths
- Examples could be multiplied, with the Oedipus myth being a close relative of the Venda myth in this regard


### Myth analysis through scapegoating: recurring themes and social dynamics.

**The Scapegoating Theme in Mythology**

**Background:**
- Plague cured by expelling right victim: Oedipus myth, Venda myth, etc.
- Similar themes, structurally identical
- Possible origin in actual scapegoating

**Myth Analysis**:
1. **Mythical Enigma**:
   - Cure comes from identifying and removing the right victim
2. **Venda Myth**:
   - Drought cured by expelling woman believed to have brought it about
3. **Methodology**:
   - Purely internal analysis of data, not reliant on historical knowledge
   - Applicable to myths as well as historical texts
4. **Potential Inventions**:
   - Unlikely that all similar myths are fabricated for the purpose of fooling us
5. **Generative Scapegoating**:
   - Myths originate in actual scapegoating
6. **Individual Text Analysis**:
   - Impossible to eliminate doubt regarding specific text's authenticity
   - Claim: Statistical probability of real victims behind themes is high
7. **Perpetual Juxtaposition**:
   - Social scourge, magical accusation, and collective violence against the accused
8. **Mimetic Theory**:
   - Not a faithful representation of what happened
   - Probability of real victims behind similar themed myths is very high.


### The importance of accepting the role of contamination in historical interpretation

**Historians' Approach to Mythology:**
- Historians have not disregarded the referentiality of their texts (belief in hidden persecution)
- Transgression of law of contamination by fantastic within historical world is acceptable but not outside it
- Interpreters refuse to apply same interpretive operation outside historical world due to audacity
- False prudence condemning mimetic theory as reprehensible

**The Principle of the Rotten Apple:**
- Potentially sound apples in myth are made paradoxically sounder by proximity of rotten apples
- Interpreters must assume principle applies until proven otherwise
- Scapegoating inside text and interpretive prudence as scapegoating (accomplices)

**Scapegoating:**
- Event (mis)represented and source of distorted representation in mythology
- Venda people feared whole community would die if they didn't get rid of second wife
- Fear led to scapegoating her, which should not be dismissed outright

**Interpretive Approach:**
- Careful investigation necessary before making exceptions to law of contamination by unbelievable
- Scapegoating and scapegoating alone accounts for every feature in text under examination and arrangement of these features.


### Interpreting Myths: Beyond Naïve Realism and Textual Nihilism

**Interpreting Myths: Understanding the Connection between Mythology and Reality**

**Importance of Interpretive Vigilance**:
- Never relax interpretive vigilance
- Fear of sounding naïvely realistic or referential should not hinder understanding of myth's fantastic dimension

**Scapegoating in Mythology**:
- Scapegoating mechanisms dominate foundational myths
- Blanket dismissal of connections between myth and the outside world perpetuates their dominance
- Textual nihilism is a last-ditch strategy of scapegoating itself

**Understanding Myths beyond Skepticism**:
- Previous interpretations limited by fear of magical contamination
- Discovering real magic behind myths moves interpretation farther from magic
- Anti-referential schools trust nothing, while mythical thinking trusts everything

**The Need for Nuanced Evaluation**:
- Differentiating believable and unbelievable features in myths is essential
- Advance beyond limited trust vs. distrust dichotomy towards more nuanced evaluation of various themes.


### Exploring the biases in interpreting mythical texts and overcoming interpretive nihilism.

**Interpretive Nihilism and Positivism**
- The current interpretive nihilism is the "twin brother" of positivism and its "misguided critical prudence"
- They both desire a second degree of "mythical thinking" that will be transcended by the mimetic theory
- This "mythical thinking" is a textual principle of interpretive guilt by association, expelling the "wheat from the chaff"
- What is actually being expelled is the expulsion that generates the text, kept safely covered up under an anti-realistic, anti-referential principle

**Mimetic Theory and Referentiality**
- The mimetic theory provides a sophisticated approach to utilize all textual resources effectively without surrendering to referential fallacies
- This is not yet fully discussed in the present essay, but it is another subject that cannot be addressed at this time

**Historical Context and Scapegoating in Texts**
- In our own Western historical context, we have learned to identify the scapegoat genesis of a text and suspend the law of contamination by the unbelievable
- This allows us to perceive intuitively the tell-tale signs of scapegoating in any text structured like a Venda myth
- Our interpretive moves seem commonplace and their validity is taken for granted
- Gradually, the demythification of myth will become as easy and banal as the demystification of a witchcraft trial record has been for centuries

**Objective and Subjective Reasons for the Lagging Interpretation of Myth**
- **Objective reasons**: The fantastic themes in myths are often more spectacular, and the tell-tale signs of real scapegoating are harder to see
- **Subjective reasons**: Ideological prejudices of anthropologists and other students of myth - our society is biased in its own favor, but professional interpreters are biased in favor of myths and prefer not to see the same collective violence they denounce in our own history.


### Analyzing Scapegoat Mechanisms in Mythology: Beyond Religion and Science

**Respect for Mythology in Academic Research**
- Renaissance onwards, academic research holds a quasi-religious respect for mythology (against anti-religious and anti-Christian biases)
- Deciphering scapegoat phenomena focuses on Judaic and Christian domains
- Threshold of demystification/deconstruction of religious texts since the last great step centuries ago
- Mimetic-scapegoat theory as crossing this threshold

**Mimetic Scapegoating Theory**
- Identifying scapegoats by applying the principle of innocent victim unjustly scapegoated
- Model: story of crucifixion and associated texts in Christian Gospels
- Scientific character of mimetic interpretation vs. irrationality of witch-hunters and mythmakers
- Revolutionary application to all possible fields, radical deconstruction

**Mythical Analysis**
- Focus on the basement level of myth analysis (easiest)
- Transformations making detection of scapegoat genesis more difficult but never really impossible
- Beyond this stage: normal development in religious history and absence of collective violence in a myth.


### Comparing African Venda myth to Greek and Germanic myths on feminine indiscretion.

**Venda Myth: Similarities to Other Myths**
* The Venda myth shares similarities with Greek (Psyche, Semele) and Germanic (Lohengrin) myths
* Theme of feminine indiscretion or mala curiositas present in all three stories
* Possible explanation for these similarities: common genesis from a shared mythical accusation
* Venda myth may provide important evidence in understanding the origin of Psyche-type myths when more widely accepted

**Venda Myth Characteristics**
* Favorite wife or mistress as victim
* Cannot be accused of adultery due to polygamy
* Rival incriminated for abusing privilege, pestering god
* Disgruntled ex-mistress believes rival is usurping her entitlements
* Theme of slanderous accusation and collective violence present in Venda version but less efficiently hidden than more elaborate Greek and Germanic myths.

**Myth Analysis:**
* The victimized heroine cannot be accused of adultery due to polygamy rules
* Rival's jealousy leads to false claims, triggering violent reaction against her
* Theme of attempting to possess or usurp something rightfully granted by a god or husband.


### Myth analysis: Unbelievable accusations and collective violence in African and Greek mythology.

**Collective Violence and Mythology:**
* Venda version reveals crucial role of collective violence in sacred power
* Olympian mythology cleansed of most sinister features, but comparison to African myths could reveal missing pieces
* Suppression of unbelievable themes becomes scandalous due to serious reasons
* Anthropological observations on violence in mythology and ritual discredited in favor of anti-referential interpretations

**Scapegoat Mechanism:**
* Suspected presence reverses law of contamination by the unbelievable into a law of contamination by the believable
* Texts more reliable when least reliable parts are unbelievable accusations
* Battle against spirit of witchcraft led to modern age's victory, but benefits not extended to texts of other cultures

**Mythological Analysis:**
* Absolute sense: myth is "nonsense"
* Relative sense: myth makes sense as deception in real world and often contains real events as well
* Referentiality of snake not as a god but as magical accusation commands referentiality of the whole myth.


### Magical accusation, community reaction, death, drought, mimetics, demythification, referentiality, social process, interpretive operation, Bible, Gospels, and Christ.

The magical accusation explains the woman's death and its impact on the community. The story of the snake is a magically charged reaction. Our interpretation does not rely on assumptions; it's based on the powerful hypothesis that there's a real social process behind the text. -141, Bible, Gospels, Christ (Part 5)


## Chapter 10 The Bibles Distinctiveness and the Gospel

**Chapter 10: The Bible's Distinctiveness and the Gospel (Things Hidden)**

**The Human Condition**:
- The truth of the human condition is twofold:
  - The truth of the mimetic predicament
  - The truth of the liberation that comes from revelation in the Gospel
- The **victimary mechanism** of human culture is rooted in the founding murder

**Narrator-Thinkers and Prophets**:
- In ancient Israel, narrator-thinkers and prophets began to view history from the standpoint of God's concern for victims rather than the sacred social order
- The truth of the innocent victim is the power of God disclosed in the suffering of the one who uncovers our structures of desire and violence

**The Gospel Witness**:
- This truth is expressed in the **Servant of the Lord**, but most notably in the Gospel witness to Jesus as Christ, Lord, Son of Man, and Son of God

**Things Hidden Format**:
- The format is a dialogue between Girard and two psychiatrist colleagues, Jean-Michel Oughourlian and Guy Lefort

**Scapegoat Mechanism**:
- It has been established as a fact, no longer open to doubt
- Girard acknowledges it is still only a hypothesis, but the material will provide new proofs and increasingly striking evidence.


### Biblical themes of crisis: dissolution, collective violence, and interdictions.

**Themes in Old Testament Narratives**

**Dissolution and Collective Violence**:
- Dissolution of differences and hierarchies within a community
- Collective violence: all against one

**Interdictions and Rituals**:
- Development of interdictions and rituals to resolve crises

**Examples from Old Testament Narratives**:
1. **Dissolution in conflict** - Tower of Babel, Corruption of Sodom and Gomorrah, Plagues in Exodus
2. **Collective Violence** - Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, Jacob vs Esau, Jacob's struggle with the angel
3. **Resolution through Expulsion**: Crisis resolved by violent expulsion of one brother/twin, return to peace and order
4. **Undecidability and Arbitrary Elements**: Relationship between brothers or doubles has a character of undecidability, resolved by expulsion through violence
5. **Identification with God**: Expelled adversary identified directly with the return to peace and order, becoming a God from whom the victor receives a blessing


### Biblical creation myths: Victim, sacrifice, and societal order establishment. Similarities with other mythologies.

**Similarities Between Biblical Myths and Other Mythologies**
- **Single victim restores community**: Sole survivor in a world where all others perish thematically similar to single victim extracted from group, guaranteeing world will begin anew (Noah's Ark, Lot and his family)
- **Interdictions and sacrifices/circumcision**: Reestablishing order in society and nature; substituted victims satisfy necessity of sacrifice (Sacrifice of Isaac, Jacob's blessing of kids)
- Society appears as whole being put in order or reestablished through founding moment: Noah's Ark, God's promise to Abraham after sacrifice of ram, rules prescribed for Jacob.

**Differences Between Mythologies and the Bible**
- Similarities demonstrated to disprove any embarrassment or attempt to conceal them
- First books of Bible based on myths that are very close to those found worldwide.


### Biblical Myths: Cain's Founding Murder vs. Roman Myths: Differences in Power and Justification.

**Distinctiveness of Biblical Myths: The Story of Cain**

**Background:**
- Discussing the founding role and differentiating power in myths
- Focus on Genesis Chapter 4's story of Cain

**Characteristics of the Myth:**
1. **Founding Murder**: One brother kills another, forming a new community
2. Divine Intervention: God responds to the murderer's appeal for protection
3. Establishment of Differentiating System: Prevents anyone from harming the murderer

**Similarities with Other Myths:**
- Rome's founding myth: Romulus kills Remus, establishing Rome
- Both stories have similar founding and differentiating power
- Discord between doubles leads to order in new communities

**Differences between Biblical and Non-Biblical Myths:**
1. **Motives for Murder**:
   - In Roman myth: Regrettable but justified by victim's transgression
   - In biblical myth: No justification given for Cain's murder of Abel
2. **Power and Roles**:
   - Romulus: Sacrificer, High Priest, and incarnation of Roman power
   - Cain: Presented as a vulgar murderer despite founding role
3. **Religious vs. Secular Powers**:
   - In Roman myth: Legislative, judiciary, military forms cannot be distinguished from religious power (Romulus)
   - In biblical myth: God's ear is given to Cain, but he is still presented as a murderer

**Significance of Differences:**
- Within the context of an anthropology centered on victimization mechanisms, the differences between these myths can have great significance in understanding their true meaning and interpretation.


### Reevaluating moral judgments in biblical texts: favoring victims over perpetrators.

**Moral Judgment in Biblical Texts**

**The Significance of Ethical Dimension:**
- Moral judgment takes precedence over other considerations
- Condemnation of murder is a prominent theme in the Bible

**Max Weber's Observations:**
- Biblical writers favor victim on moral grounds
- Tendency to defend victims is unique to Jewish culture
- Rooted in Jewish history and lack of great historical success
- Seen as a sociological and cultural phenomenon

**Implications for Victimary Anthropology:**
- Taking the side of the victim: significance not insignificant
- Myths may reflect collective violence that founds a community
- Myths can be distorted by belief in victim's guiltiness
- Rehabilitating victims and denouncing persecutors is essential.


### The Bible's Cain myth reveals the violent origins and self-destructive nature of culture.

**Impact of Violence on Culture**

**Cain Myth**:
- Primitive story with repercussions on mythology and cultural forms
- Initial stages show brilliant flowering of culture, but violence escapes containment
- Borderline between legalized punishment, vengeance, and blood feud erased
- Cain's seven victims become Lamech's seventy-seven
- Undifferentiated violence propagates contagiously

**The Flood**:
- Crisis in which the whole of culture is submerged
- Destruction not only a punishment from God, but also a result of self-destructive process
- Brings back the violence from which culture originally managed to get free

**Significance of Cain Myth**:
- Affirmation that victim is innocent and culture founded on murder retains a thoroughly murderous character
- Reveals the collective character of persecution in story of Joseph
- Biblical authors critically reappraised preexistent mythology to reflect their concerns

**Collective Character of Persecution**:
- Hidden foundation of collective murder affects forms of ritual, interdictions, and religious transcendence
- Cultural forms and values are affected even those furthest removed from the domain of myth
- Violence propagates contagiously, leading to self-destructive cycle.


### Reinterpreting myths: Joseph's story and the role of victim rehabilitation.

**Mythological Perspective on Joseph's Story:**
* Inversion of relationship between victim (Joseph) and persecuting community (his eleven brothers)
* Original myths may have sanctioned charge of hubris against Joseph
* Two separate sources combined: Elohist (Reuben) and Yahwist (Judah)
* Accusation against Egyptian master has an incestuous character, declared false in the story
* Comparison to Phaedra and Hippolytus myth where Hippolytus is treated as guilty party but eventually forgiven by his father.

**Victim Rehabilitation:**
* Desacralizing effect on victim (Joseph)
* No demoniac or divine aspects, simply human
* Convincing people that humanity is innocent of founding murder and eliminating traces of it.

**Mythological Analysis:**
* Joseph's story: victim falsely accused, clemency granted in the end
* Comparison to Phaedra and Hippolytus myth: similar forgiveness but with an element of hubris
* Two separate sources combined, each rehabilitating the victim at expense of brothers.


### Subverting Mythic Foundations: Bible's Critique of Religious Origins

**Bible's Inverse Movement**
- Bible attempts to discredit and annul origin stories by:
  - Laying blame on Cainite culture for unjust murder of Abel
  - Demystifying myths

**Analysis of Genesis and Exodus**
- **Cain**: Unjust murder of Abel bases Cainite culture
- **Romulus and Remus**: Murder of Remus presented as justified
- **Moses and Egyptians**: Jewish people identified with scapegoat, expelled from Egypt
  - Moses plays role of scapegoat, reestablishing order in Egyptian society

**Mythic Framework vs. Subversion**
- Bible deals with mythic forms that have been subverted
- Retains many characteristics of myth but:
  - Challenges primitive religion's foundations (mythology, sacrificial cult, law)
  - Brings victims to light and questions their role in foundation stories

**Law and Prophets Books**
- Increasing tendency for victims brought to light
- Subversion of:
  - Mythology
  - Sacrificial cult (explicitly rejected before Exile)
  - Primitive conception of law as obsessive differentiation, refusal of mixed states.


### Biblical prophets criticize excessive sacrifices and promote community harmony.

**The Prophets' Criticism of Sacrifice**
- Fear of violence plays a significant role in the prophets' horrified reaction to forbidden mixtures (Isaiah 1:10 - 17, Jeremiah 6:20, Hosea 5:6; 6:6; 9:11-13, Amos 5:21-25, Micah 6:6-8)
- Critics often downplay the prophets' opposition to sacrificial practices as only opposing "cultural syncretism" or unorthodox practices.
- The texts are too numerous and explicit for this argument to hold water.

**The Distinction Between Ancient Times and Ideal Period**
- Prophets draw a distinction between the profuse sacrifices during their time and the ideal period, which was the desert dwelling when animal sacrifices were impossible due to the absence of livestock (Micah 6:6-8).
- The deep-seated reason for their refusal comes to surface in the link between animal sacrifice and child sacrifice.

**Mimetic Crisis in Sacrifice**
- If Ezekiel takes a sacrificial position, it is because sacrifices had no more than ceremonial and archaeological value during his period (Micah 6:6-8).
- The mimetic crisis stays "sacrificial" in the broader sense but is no longer centered on sacrificial rites properly speaking.

**The Inspiration of the Prophets**
- Legal prescriptions are of little consequence so long as you keep from fighting one another and do not become enemy twins (Leviticus).
- The true raison d'être for the prophets is maintaining harmonious relationships within the community.


### Prophets and the Crisis of Sacrifice in Hebrew Religion: The Role of the Suffering Messiah.

**Subversion of Primitive Religion by Prophets**
- Myth, sacrifice, and prohibitions are subverted in prophetic literature
- Crisis in Hebraic society amplified by threat from Babylon and Assyria
- Political developments interpreted as religious crisis: exhausted sacrificial system, dissolving traditional order

**Comparison of Crises**
- Common experience involved in both crises
- Mythic texts reveal crisis directly through prophetic books
- Unique resolution of this type of crisis: collective transference mechanism

**Prophetic Books and the Servant of Yahweh**
- Four "Songs of the Servant of Yahweh" in Isaiah (42:1-4; 49:1-6; 50:4-11; 52:13-53:12)
- Unity and independence from surrounding material
- Double theme: triumphant Messiah and suffering Messiah, Servant of Yahweh

**Significance of the Prophetic Books**
- Clearer description of founding mechanism than in earlier texts
- Four Songs offer integrally related, explicit discussions on the Servant's role in resolving the prophetic crisis.


### Old Testament analysis: The Servant's innocence and God's ambiguous role in his sacrifice

**The Servant's Role as a Human Sacrifice in Isaiah 53**

**Description of the Servant**:
- Receptacle for all violence
- Takes the place of all members of the community
- No form or comeliness, despised and rejected by men

**Similarities to Pagans Sacrificial Victims**:
- Traits: similar to a certain type, e.g., Greek pharmakos
- Fate: similar to that of the anathema

**Characteristics of the Servant's Death**:
- Collective and legal event, sanctioned by authorities
- Innocence: no connection with violence or deceit in his mouth

**Responsibility for the Servant's Death**:
- Men are responsible for his saving death (Isa. 53:4)
- Some passages attribute exclusive responsibility to men
- Ambiguity regarding Yahweh's role: some present him as principal instigator of persecution, others deny God's involvement

**Old Testament Concept of Deity**:
- Divested of primitive violence characteristic of deities
- Vengeance still attributed to Yahweh
- Inconclusiveness in Old Testament regarding primitive aspects that continue to stand despite counteracting inspirations.


### Jesus' accusations against Pharisees reveal universal significance through scapegoat concept in Gospels.

**Divine Retribution in the Old Testament**
- **Sacrifices criticized but continue**: simplified and identified with love of neighbor, yet Yahweh still the god of vengeance
- Notion of divine retribution alive
- Jesus' teachings in Gospels of Matthew and Luke extend Judaic Bible, completing unfinished enterprise

**The Scapegoat in the Gospels**
- Texts formerly titled "Curses against the Scribes and Pharisees"
- Embarrassing readings that restrict universal significance
- Jesus accuses Pharisees as intermediary for something greater
- Universal significance lies in the scapegoat concept

**The Curses Against the Pharisees (Matthew 23:34-36)**
- Prophets, wise men, and scribes will be persecuted and killed
- Allows for the shedding of all righteous blood on earth, from Abel to Zechariah
- Implies many murders throughout history
- Mention of first (Abel) and last (Zechariah) murders signifies completeness


### Universal consequences of historical acts of violence against prophets and righteous individuals.

**Understanding the Universal Phenomenon of Murder (Abel to Zechariah)**
* The text is a recapitulation that cannot be restricted to Jewish religion or history
* Implicitly includes victims who belong between Abel and Zechariah
* Universal phenomenon with consequences for all generations, not limited to a single region
* Identified as "all the righteous blood shed on earth" (Luke 11:50-51)
	+ Apo kataboles kosmou in Greek text
	+ Vulgate uses the translation "a constitutione mundi"
	+ Denotes order coming out of disorder, foundation of the world
* Jesus identified the whole Bible as referring to this phenomenon
* The Pharisees were first to be condemned for their spiritual and intellectual solidarity with those who carried out the killings (Matt. 23:31)
	+ Not a hereditary transmission of guilt, but a repudiation of the fathers that leads to repeating their actions
* The sons believe they can express their independence by condemning the fathers, but unconsciously imitate and repeat the acts of their fathers.


### The founding murder and lies in the Bible: Abel, Satan, and human communities.

**The Relationship Between the Sons and Their Fathers:**
* The sons are still influenced by their father's mental structure caused by an ancient murder (Matthew 23:30)
* Wishing to cause a break maintains continuity between fathers and sons
* Triple correspondence set up between Satan, original homicide, and the lie (John 8:43-44)

**Significance of Abel's Murder:**
* First founding murder in Genesis
* Origin of law sanctioning murder as sevenfold reprisal
* Origin of rule against homicide within Cainite culture
* Origin of that culture (Genesis)

**Interpretation of the Johannine Text:**
* Goes further than synoptic texts in disentangling founding mechanisms
* Excises definitions and specifications for mythic interpretation
* Reveals hypothesis of the scapegoat mechanism

**Misconceptions by Biblical Specialists:**
* Move from myth to myth, signifier to signified without considering symbolic matrix (scapegoat mechanism)
* Ethnologists and other specialists in human sciences share similar misconceptions.


### Satan as the source of human violence and falsehood in biblical interpretation.

**Paradoxical Blindness of Biblical Experts**
- Experts fail to recognize key interpretation in texts under their noses
- Refuse to make use of it
- Unbelievable opportunities staring them in the face

**Satan: The True Adversary**
- Identified with founding mechanism of all human community
- Principle of all human culture and society
- Source of rivalry, disorder, lying order
- Represents mimetic process seen as a whole
- Offers domination in exchange for worship
- Living obstacle that trips men up
- Mimetic model as rival and hindrance to truth
- Identified with murder and lies
- Human beings are sons of Satan due to inherent violence
- Murder is an unending source of falsehood
- Prevents Gospel from reaching people
- Explicit revelation remains a dead letter for many.

**Convergence of Gospels**
- Gospels represent convergent versions of one and the same thought
- Modern commentators focus on differences between texts
- Differences exist but are minor
- Convergence escapes those who focus only on divergences.


### Metaphor of the Tomb: Concealing Violence in Human Culture and Individuals.

**The Metaphor of the Tomb**

**Minor Defects in Transcribed Message**:
- Allows discovery of "particular minor defects" in the entirety of the message being transcribed
- Reveals a concealed relation of dependence on founding murder
- Demonstrates paradoxical continuity between violence of past generations and denunciation of that violence in contemporaries

**The Metaphor of the Tomb**:
- Tombs exist to honor the dead, but also to conceal their death
- Men kill to lie to others and themselves about violence and death
- **Jesus reproaches the scribes and Pharisees for putting up tombs for the prophets killed by their fathers**:
  - Not recognizing the founding character of murder perpetuates the foundation, which is an obscuring of the truth
  - All cultures and religions are built on this concealed foundation
- **Murder calls for the tomb, and the tomb is but the prolongation and perpetuation of murder**
- The tomb-religion amounts to the becoming visible of the foundations of religion and culture

**Individual Application**:
- The Pharisees are identified with the system of misrecognition on which they rely as a community


### Exploring the hidden meaning of tombs in human history and psyche.

**The Significance of Tomb Metaphors**

**Displacement and Cultural Rituals**:
- Speaking of the "metaphor" is speaking of displacement
- No metaphorical displacement is involved here
- The tomb is the starting point for constitutive displacements of culture
- Funerary rituals may have been the first actions of a cultural type
- These rituals could have taken shape around the first reconciliatory victims and creative transference
- Sacrificial stones marking ancient city foundations are associated with lynching stories

**Biblical Metaphors**:
- The text refers to the Pharisees as "white-washed tombs" and "graves which are not seen"
- This double concealment reflects how cultural differentiation develops on the basis of the founding murder
- The murder tends to efface itself behind sacrificial rituals, which in turn are effaced behind postritual institutions

**Significance of the Hypothesis**:
- More is involved than an allusion to specific tombs or moral indictments
- It is not just about individual "sin" or psychoanalytic "complexes"
- It is about the corpse that rots and spreads "uncleanness" within individuals, religious/cultural systems, and postritual institutions.


### Jesus as innocent victim of humanity's violent disavowal of its own violence in religion and culture.

**The Problem of Repressed Knowledge**
* Lost knowledge: essentials often repressed by organization of religion and law (Luke 11:52)
* Pharisees blind to essentials, hindering those they guide
* Jesus reveals intolerable truth about human violence in society
* Passion as consequence of revelation (Luke 11:53)
* Human culture built on disavowal of human violence
* Religion from man vs. religion from God
* Jesus infringes upon supreme prohibition, silenced

**The Truth of the Founding Murder**
* Expressed in Jesus' words (Luke 11:52)
* Connects present conduct to distant past and near future
* Announces Passion and fulfills prophecy
* Revealed truth has little consequence if centuries pass before revival
* Everything hidden will eventually be revealed.

**Jesus as the Innocent Victim of a Group in Crisis**
* Presented as innocent victim of united group against him
* Crowd, Jewish religious authorities, Roman political authorities, and disciples all give assent to his death (Luke 11:53)
* Previously welcomed Jesus with enthusiasm.


### Crowd's irrational decision for Jesus' death: parallels with ancient rituals.

**The Crowd's Collective Spirit and the Passion of Christ**

**The Crowd's Demand for Jesus' Death**:
- The crowd turns around like a single man, insisting on Jesus' death with determination
- This change in attitude is not justified by any new information

**Ritual Sacrifice and the Passion Story**:
- The decision to put Jesus to death is a collective one, identifying the crucifixion with a process that underlies all rituals and religious phenomena
- Parallels between the Passion story and other rituals:
  - Preliminary trial
  - Derisive crowd
  - Grotesque honors for the victim
  - Role of chance in the form of casting lots
  - Degrading punishment outside the holy city

**Ethnological Interpretations**:
- Ethnologists have attempted to attribute ritualistic motives to some actors in the Passion story
- Jesus is seen as a "scapegoat" for Roman soldiers caught up in the Saturnalia
  - Frazer debated with German researchers about the precise ritual involved
- The treatment of Christ by the Roman soldiers resembles that of the mock king of Sacaea


### Comparing mock kings in Bible and ancient texts: questioning historical accuracy.

**The Mockery of Jesus: Comparison to Sacaea's Mock King**

**St. Matthew's Description**:
- Barabbas released in place of Jesus
- Jesus scourged, delivered for crucifixion
- Soldiers gathered, mocked Jesus
  - Placed a scarlet robe on him
  - Put a crown of thorns on his head
  - Offered him a reed as scepter
  - Kneeled before him in mockery
  - Spit on him and struck his head with the reed
  - Removed robe, returned his own clothing
  - Led him away to be crucified

**Comparison to Dio Chrysostom's Description of Sacaea's Mock King**:
- Prisoner seated on king's throne
- Given the king's raiment
- Allowed to "lord it and drink and run riot, use the king's concubines"
- Afterwards, stripped, scourged, and crucified

**Limitations of Frazer's Hypothesis**:
- Assumes Gospel text is historical or on-the-spot reporting
- Doesn't consider internal organization of the text
- Prejudice against considering deeper levels in the text
- Detailed observations, but naive in some respects

**Analogies Between Religious Forms**:
- Extend beyond those embraced by ethnologists
- Include examples like the "servant of Yahweh" and other Old Testament texts


### Dissecting the connection between ancient curses and the Passion in the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles.

**Comparative Analysis of Biblical Texts by Rollin G. Gaither**

**Background:**
- Comparison between Gospels and "Curses" texts
- Macmillan publication in 1963 (New York)

**Gaither's Perspective:**
- Rejects analogies between Gospels and "Curses" as inadmissible
- Believes they are invented for religious purposes
- Focuses on those that discredit Gospel claims
- Positivist spirit only accepts analogies that serve his argument

**Transference:**
- Necessary for effective, sacralizing act
- Victim inherits all violence from which community is exonerated
- Prevents victim from being seen as guilty

**Gospel Texts:**
- Presented as blatant pieces of injustice against Jesus
- Collective violence placed on those responsible
- No attempt to conceal arbitrary and unjust nature of violence

**Mythic Nature of Gospels:**
- Revelation in words does not deny old primitive curses
- Reveals founding mechanism, leaving men without sacrifice protection
- Collective will to silence speaker results in murder
- Reproduction of founding mechanism confirms truth of speech

**Acts of the Apostles:**
- Text from Gospels (not strictly speaking)
- Compact and striking form of process leading from "curses" to Passion
- Reveals lying violence as source of all lies.


### Stephen's speech and stoning: Reproducing the founding murder in the Gospel.

**The Relationship Between Stephen's Speech and the Passion**

**Stephen's Speech**:
- Represents the sequence of "curses" and the Passion in a compact, articulated way
- Causes immediate death of the person who made it
- Contains references to:
  - The murders already named by Jesus
  - The murder of Jesus himself, which is now an established fact
- Reenacts the founding murder and highlights the relationship between the revelation that compromises the community's basis in violence and the new violence that casts out the revelation

**Stephen's Words**:
- Cause the audience to become "enraged" and "ground their teeth" against him
- Lead to Stephen being "cast out of the city and stoned"

**The Significance of Stephen's Execution**:
- Represents the Jewish equivalent of the Greek anathema, a form of sacrifice used for the most impure of criminals
- Renews the beneficial effects of wiping out the dangers to which the blasphemer exposes the community


### Ritualized stoning: Unanimous, spontaneous collective violence in Deuteronomy.

**Ritual Execution and Unanimous Participation**

**Background:**
- Deuteronomy 17:7 forbids ritual execution within community to avoid pollution of violence
- Stoning of Stephen takes place outside Jerusalem's walls, fulfilling this requirement
- Reproduction of original murder requires unanimous participation by entire community or those present

**Problem:**
- No contact with polluted victim while ensuring unanimous participation
- Stoning resolves issue: fulfills distance execution requirement (like firing squad)
- Only person not participating in event is Saul of Tarsus, but his heart is with murderers
- Participants rushed upon Stephen "with one accord" for unanimity
- Debate among commentators if the execution was legal or a lynching

**Significance:**
- Ritualized mode of execution coincides with spontaneous violence
- Possible form of spontaneous violence can be ritualized without altering in form
- Unanimous participation essential for both ritual and potential illegal execution.


### The text explores the connection between martyrdom and the "curses," focusing on Stephen's death as a witness to unjust persecution. It discusses the implications of recognizing this violence and the potential for perpetuating it in interpretations of religious texts.

**The Martyrdom of Stephen and the Hypothesis of Founding Violence**

**Relationship between the "Curses" and the Passion**
- Stephen's martyrdom reveals and underscores the relationship
- Reproduces the twofold relationship between the "curses" and the Passion

**Verification of the "Curses" through Martyrdom**
- Stephen, like Jesus, is killed to forestall verification
- He is the first of those spoken of in the "curses" (Matthew 23:34-35, Luke 11:49-50)
- Dying in the same way as Jesus, martyrs multiply the revelation of founding violence

**Universal Application of the Text**
- The text does not limit application to confessors of faith in a narrow sense
- No further sacralization is possible for victims' persecution to be recognized as unjust
- Gospels reveal the founding mechanism, stopping it from functioning
- Fewer myths and more texts bearing on persecution in our universe dominated by the Gospels

**The Scapegoat Text and Interpretations**
- Process of misunderstanding must be reproduced through restrictive interpretations
- Transference of violence upon the scapegoat, historically and ideologically different but structurally invariant
- Universal revelation transformed into a polemical denunciation against the Jewish religion
- People claim it only involves Jews to avoid recognizing their own involvement in the message.


### The Gospels' critique of religious blindness and violence towards the Jews.

**The Reproduction of Violence in Religion**

**Jesus' Criticism of the Pharisees**:
- Jesus reproached the Pharisees for shedding the blood of innocent people
- Since Jesus has been accepted, this process can no longer be done directly to him

**Christians and the Reproduction of Violence**:
- Christians claim they would not have participated in the violence against Jews if they had lived back then
- This fulfills the measure of their fathers' actions
- Christians repeat the same misunderstanding as the Pharisees

**The Text as a Victim**:
- The text itself is blamed for not mastering the old violence except by diverting it to new victims
- The Gospel text is condemned by public opinion in the name of charity
- The Gospels claim to have universal significance, requiring nothing on earth to be superior to the Jewish religion and the sect of the Pharisees

**The Bible and Mythology**:
- The revelation of violence made on the basis of biblical texts is part of the Bible's founding myth
- The inspiration of the Bible and prophets undoes myths to reveal their truth


### Exploring the role of Judeo-Christian texts in understanding violence and sacrifice

**Understanding Violence and the Sacred**
- J.-M.O.: To understand violence in Gospels, we must first grasp how mythic meanings engender this violence
- Judeo-Christian texts confirm analysis through scientific procedures
- Thesis of scapegoat not based on impressionistic or literary borrowing
- Demonstrated through anthropological texts
- R.G.: Aware of criticisms, but committed to reinforcing systematic character and revealing genesis/structure of cultural phenomena
- Intellectual journey led to Judeo-Christian writings, initially resisted due to modernist orthodoxy
- Modern period sees Judeo-Christian texts as alien to modern philosophy and "sciences of man"
- Forces bringing Judeo-Christian Scriptures closer, reversing order of reading
- Ethnological research demonstrates Christianity as one religion among others, challenges singularity claims.


### Revealing the foundation of religion through the rejected stone in Psalm 118.

**Demystification of Religion: The Significance of Rejected Texts**

**Discovering the Mechanism of Religion:**
- Collective transference against a victim: revile and sacralize
- Reveals source of all analogies behind myths
- Essential stone in structure of "demystification"

**Role of Ancient Texts:**
- Twenty to twenty-five centuries old
- Initially revered blindly, today rejected with contempt
- Reveal means for radically sociological reading
- Place own transcendence in an impervious area

**The Parable of the Tenants of the Vineyard:**
- Collective expulsion of victim forms foundation of all human religions and culture
- Foundation remains concealed as long as it does not become apparent
- Texts that reveal this foundation are no longer built upon it

**Psalm 118: The Rejected Stone Becomes the Head of the Corner:**
- Quoted by Christ in Luke 20:17
- Traditionally considered a "mystical" reference
- Interpretation required for which Christ himself can provide
- Foundational stone revealed, no longer forms a foundation
- Leads to something radically different.


### Christ as the hidden cornerstone: Revealing the structural matrix of religion through biblical exegesis.

**The Problem of Exegesis**

**Christ's Audience**:
- The problem can be resolved if we see the words Christ quotes as the formula for the reversal
- The "rejected stone" is the scapegoat, who is Christ
- By submitting to violence, Christ reveals and uproots the structural matrix of all religion
- The text alerts us to its own functioning, which eludes the laws of ordinary textuality

**Christian Claims**:
- If this movement is indeed in the text, Christian claims to make Christ the author of a universal revelation are more securely founded than imagined
- These claims fall back into ordinary textuality, blotting out the true point of origin
- This true point of origin is still clearly inscribed in Scripture

**Exegetes' Failures**:
- Exegetes fail to recognize the reverberations of this phrase on the anthropological level
- They read the Gospels in light of myths, rather than reading myths in light of the Gospels
- Their exercises in demystification are only slight sketches, but may also be cunning obstacles against the Gospel revelation

**Advance of Revelation**:
- The obstacles themselves must contribute to the invisible but ineluctable advance of revelation.


## Chapter 11 The Nonsacrificial Death of Christ

The Gospels reveal scapegoat mechanisms through Jesus' teachings and death, yet they are often misunderstood as endorsing sacrifice. Modern agnosticism and atheism also contribute to the invisibility of these mechanisms. This discussion on the nonsacrificial death of Christ is from a chapter called "A Non-Sacrificial Reading of the Gospel Text" in "Things Hidden." (Approximate word count: 75)


### Reevaluating Sacrifice: From Violence to Mercy in Christianity

**Sacrifice:**
- **Girard's stance**: became more disposed to balance violent aspects with positive connotations in recent years (Chapter 6 introduction)
- **Appropriate usage**: loving willingness to give one's life for another; historical background of Jesus' death and derived positive connotations
- **Redefinition based on faith**: God of love, Son's suffering not due to divine wrath but human inability to receive Him or His Son

**Sacrifice in the Gospels:**
- Rejected: Matt. 9:13, quoted from Hosea - "I desire mercy, and not sacrifice"
- Crucifixion as sacrifice?: Nothing in Gospels suggests it is a sacrifice; no definition given for that sacrifice
- Misunderstanding of mankind's violence: necessary yet criticized.

**Sacrifice vs. Reconciliation:**
- Matt. 5:23-24: leave gift and be reconciled with brother before offering it
- Distance between cult of sacrifice and true function revealed in this text.


### Reevaluating the Christian Gospels: Subverting Sacrificial Interpretations.

**Understanding the Nonsacrificial Reading of the Gospels**

**Importance of Reappraising Sacrificial Interpretations**:
- Anthropological perspective rooted in Gospels' subversion of sacrifice
- Foundational for understanding all intellectual experiences
- Enables transmission to human sciences by revealing the founding mechanism

**Sacrificial Reading and Christian Text**:
- Provides basis for "Christendom" culture
- Rooted in misunderstanding of text that reveals founding mechanism
- Cultures, including Christianity, rely on this sacrificial vision

**Consequences of Nonsacrificial Reading**:
- Rules out compromise with principle of sacrifice
- Exposes real meaning and function of the Passion
- Subverts sacrifice by forcing founding mechanism into the open

**Objections to Nonsacrificial Reading**:
- Redemptive character of Jesus' death
- Conception of a violent God in themes like the Apocalypse
- Sword metaphor in Gospels implying discord and dissension

**Addressing Objections**:
- Nonsacrificial reading explains intrinsic conception of Gospel actions
- Seamless integration of all Gospel themes into a coherent totality
- Rejecting sacrificial definition of the Passion leads to a simpler, more direct understanding.


### Exploring the non-sacrificial message of Jesus in relation to ancient Greek philosophy.

**Understanding Jesus' Message Beyond Sacrifice**

**The Sacrificial Mentality**:
- Rid ourselves of the vestiges of this mentality to understand Jesus' message
- Jesus is a direct, though involuntary, cause of division and dissension due to his incomprehensible message

**Jesus' Actions**:
- Directed toward nonviolence, making it an effective form of action
- Cannot be held responsible for the apocalyptic dimension underlying Jewish history

**The Old Testament and the Gospel**:
- The superiority of the Old Testament over mythology meant the point of no return had been reached
- The Law and the Prophets constitute a genuine announcement of the Gospel, but this was not recognized

**Jesus' Arrival on the Scene**:
- Marks the end of cyclical history, as its mechanisms begin to be uncovered
- No longer possible to put the clock back

**The Pre-Socratics**:
- Empedocles gives an anti-sacrificial text, but the pre-Socratics cannot see the ethical consequences in human relationships

**Jesus' Commitment to Nonviolence**:
- Not a commitment that could be revoked like a contract
- Jesus sees himself as bound by the promise of the Kingdom, even unto death
- This makes him the Incarnation of that Word.


### Jesus as the embodiment of God's Word and warning humanity from impending violence.

**Violence and the Sacred** by Ivan Illich (1977)

**The Importance of the Word of God**
- Christ is a reflection of the Word of God
- Jesus remains faithful to this Word of Love
- Preaching of Kingdom intervenes at crucial moment when chances for success are high

**Jesus' Message and Reaction**
- Warns humanity about impending violence
- Announcing Kingdom observes principles he proclaims
- Fails in love if silent, abandoning human race to destiny

**Son of Man Mission**
- Watchman for the house of Israel (Ezekiel 33:1-11)
- Warn wicked to turn from ways, save life
- If not heeded, Jesus becomes victim

**Jesus' Urgent Message and Vehemence**
- Preaching Kingdom at critical moment
- Threat of limitless violence justifies urgency
- Offensive language, immoderate polemics necessary for warning
- Accused of unnecessary violence, offensive language

**The Son of Man's Role in Warnings**
- Mission to warn people and turn them away from fatal paths
- Most extreme texts are dangerous for messenger


### Jesus as the ultimate innocent victim, revealing violence's nature.

**The Scapegoat as Victim Par Excellence: Jesus**

**Jesus as Sacrificial Victim**:
- Jesus does not resist those who would harm him
- His death represents the "meaning of all the persecutions and expulsions in which mankind has ever engaged"
- He is the most arbitrary and least violent victim, yet also the most innocent
- Violence is unable to bear the presence of a being that owes it no homage or threatens its kingship

**The Rejection of Jesus**:
- Those who have refused the invitation to the Kingdom see Jesus as "destructive and subversive", a "source of contamination"
- This is because his preaching reveals that there is an element of violence even in the most apparently holy institutions
- Faithful to the logic of sacrifice, those who reject Jesus are obliged to turn against him

**The Scapegoat's Revealing Role**:
- The scapegoat is the "most arbitrary of victims" because they are not responsible for the violence done to them
- Yet the scapegoat is also the least arbitrary and most meaningful, as they represent the history of mankind's persecutions and misconceptions
- Violence reveals its own game in trying to conceal its "ridiculous secret" by forcing itself into action


### Jesus' death as resistance against sacrificial order and violence in history

**Discussion on Passion of Christ and Violence**

**The Passion: A Neglected Event**
- Found between preaching of Kingdom and Apocalypse
- Ignored by historians due to more serious topics
- No importance in world's eyes, but effective in subverting cultural order
- Can undermine and overturn entire cultural order

**J.-M.O.'s Questions**
1. **Hypostatizing violence**: treating it as a subjective agency hostile to Jesus Christ?
   - Violence is always the true subject in every ritual or institutional structure
   - Becomes adversary when sacrificial order begins to disintegrate (the devil)
2. **Reconciliation with real history of Christianity**
   - No response at this stage, but will address later

**Textual Logic and History**
- Coherence found in text
- Not concerned with relationship to history at present
- Recognizing Christ's death as not a sacrificial one
  * Word of God: "I wish for mercy and not sacrifices"
  * Jesus remains if word is obeyed; must die if violence does
- No gratuitous utterance of this word, which becomes a slave to violence if not followed.

**J.-M.O.'s Clarification**
- Christ's death not a disguised suicide.


### The text explores the paradox of nonviolence leading to violence in the context of Jesus' teachings.

**The Maudlin and Morbid Element in Christianity**

**Misunderstanding of Violence**:
- People do not see that human community is dominated by violence
- Failure to understand the dilemma between killing and being killed
- Reputation for "exaggerating" or "taking things tragically"

**Escaping the Dilemma**:
- Thousand different ways to escape from such a dilemma
- People are indebted to violence for the degree of peace they enjoy
- Nonviolence can become fatal if others refuse to accept it

**Jesus' Teachings and the Kingdom of God**:
- Absolute fidelity to the principle of the Kingdom condemns Jesus
- Refusal of the Kingdom by Jesus' listeners leads to scapegoating and apocalyptic violence
- Gospels repeatedly announce the crucifixion and Apocalypse
- "Gift of prophecy" is the detection of the two logics of violence and nonviolence

**Logic of Violence vs. Logic of Nonviolence**:
- Logic of violence provisionally has the last word, but logic of nonviolence is superior
- Modern interpreters fail to detect the existence of this superior logic
- Reproductive of attitudes stigmatized by the text


### Interpreting Jesus' role in God's plan: love versus violence debate.

**Discussion on Jesus' Role and Interpretations of His Teachings**

**Jesus' Obedience to Father's Love**:
- Jesus obeys the promptings of love from the Father, directed toward all mankind
- All mankind is called to become sons of God
- Jesus is the only one who perfectly conforms to this calling

**The Son vs. Other People**:
- Jesus hears and follows the Word of the Father, while others cannot
- The distinction is crucial but not sacrificial in nature

**Jesus as the Only Man to Fulfill God's Calling**:
- Jesus is the only man who has nothing to do with violence and its works
- He fulfills a calling that belongs to all mankind
- His death on earth is not because of any irrational sacrifice or divine requirement for violence

**Understanding the Founding Murder**:
- The true nature of the "founding murder" is not fully understood by mankind
- This perpetuates the misunderstanding and inability to hear God's Word
- Mankind is responsible for killing Jesus, as they were unable to reconcile without violence
- Even the death of the just could not reconcile them, leading to limitless violence.


### Jesus' nonviolent sacrifice for love of neighbor.

**Jesus' Will vs. God's Will: Dying as a Form of Love**

**The Difference Between Obedience and Sacrifice**
- Jesus' statement "Your will be done and not mine" relates to dying, not just obedience to an incomprehensible demand for sacrifice
- The death of Jesus comes from God, not men
- Dying out of love is different from sacrificing one's own life based on an external order

**Love and Neighborliness: Death as the Fullest Expression of Love**
- 1 John 3:14-15 highlights that love leads to death, as failing to love results in killing
- Killing and dying are equivalent in terms of evil reciprocity and destructive escalation

**The Fundamental Human Situation: Mimetic Rivalry and the Circle of Evil Reciprocity**
- The basis for all is mimetic rivalry leading to a destructive escalation
- Killing and dying are one and the same in this context

**Saving One's Life vs. Losing It: Breaking Out of the Circle of Murder and Death**
- To save one's life by not loving results in death
- Agreeing to lose one's life keeps it for eternal life, as only those who do not kill truly know love

**Jesus' Relations with the Father: Absence of Violence vs. the Need for Sacrifice**
- Contradiction between Jesus' peaceful relations with the Father and the assertion of a need for sacrifice originating from the Father


### Divine violence and its connection to human aggression in religious contexts. (12 words)

The divine economy of violence stems from human violence projection onto God (188, Gospel perspective).


## Chapter 12 The Divinity of Christ

**The Divinity of Christ**

**The Passion of Christ**:
- Reveals the full truth of the innocent victim
- Cannot abide in human culture, must be expelled
- The Passion of Christ is key to revelation
- Resurrection confirms the work of God the Father

**The Revelatory Act**:
- Must be performed by the God-Man (Christ)
- Capable of escaping the mimetic predicament
- Must be human to be comprehended
- Must be God to subject himself to human desire and violence

**Love and the Divine Transcendence**:
- Love in the Christian sense (agape) is not like common sense
- Only Jesus has succeeded in equaling God in the perfection of his love
- Theologians are fearful of making the divine too accessible
- **Commandments**:
    - Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind
    - Love your neighbor as yourself


### Jesus as God and Man: Nonsacrificial Interpretation of Christian Texts

**The Two Commandments and Love**
- The two commandments are alike as love makes no distinctions between beings (Matt. 22:37-39; Mark 12:28-31; Luke 10:25-28)
- Jesus is the perfect representation of humanity and deity (Gospel text, especially John and synoptic Gospels)
- The Incarnation theology is not an invention but rigorously adheres to the logic in the text
- Nonsacrificial reading allows understanding of Jesus as united with the Father in fullness of humanity and divinity
- Implies possibility of mankind becoming like God through Son's mediation, as he is the only Mediator
- Human violence is a deceptive worldview; transcendent love remains invisible beyond it

**Jesus as God and Man**
- Jesus is both God and Man (Gospel text, especially John and synoptic Gospels)
- Theology of Incarnation not fantasy but adheres to the logic in the text
- Union of Son with Father in fullness of humanity and divinity
- Possibility of mankind becoming like God through Son's mediation

**Transcendence and Human Violence**
- Two forms of transcendence: one concealed by violence (Matthew 27:26)
- To detect transcendent love, accept that human violence is a deceptive worldview
- Confusion between the two forms of transcendence insignificant from violent mentality's perspective.


### Revealing truth about violence: witnesses recounting nonviolent resistance

**The Revelation of Violence**

**Opposition between Nonviolence and Violence**:
- No form of structural analysis can detect this radical opposition
- Seeing the revelation of violence is like looking in a mirror, "darkly, en aanigmate"

**Challenges in Acknowledging Nonviolence**:
- Christian text presents someone who triumphs over violence by not resisting it
- This truth about nonviolence cannot be entertained in the human community
- People are most open to this truth at the stage when false differences melt away, but also the point of greatest violence

**Violence Conceals Its Own Truth**:
- Violence can conceal its own truth by:
  - Causing the mechanism of transference to reestablish the sacred regime
  - Pushing destruction as far as it will go
- This is evident when violence starts to reveal itself as the basis of the community

**Revealing the Truth about Violence**:
- The victim must reach out at the moment their mouth is being shut by violence
- Witnesses must be clear-sighted enough to recount the event without altering its significance
- This requires a man who is not obliged to or thinking in terms of violence


### Christ's divinity: the nonviolent response to violence in religious texts.

**The Concept of Christ's Divinity and Nonviolence in Christianity**

**Understanding the Truth:**
- To comprehend hidden truth, one must already occupy victim's place
- Occupying the place requires grasping the truth first
- Acting against violence essential for understanding it

**Gospels and Theology:**
- Proclamation of Christ's divinity not a disconnection from logic of texts
- Forms only possible conclusion within this logic
- Human inability to grasp knowledge confirms theological intuitions
- Rational foundations become intelligible beyond sacrificial version of Christianity

**The Divinity of Jesus:**
- Not an excessive piece of praise or rhetorical overkill
- Fit response to inescapable constraint

**Recognizing Christ as God:**
- Capable of rising above violence that transcended humanity
- Only agent who can free us from dominance of cultural structures
- Orthodox hypothesis enabling account for revelation in Gospel about violence and its effects

**Implications:**
- Nonviolent deity signals existence by being driven out by violence
- Demonstration remains ambiguous due to appearance of total impotence under regime of violence.


### The divine can initially impact through disguise and hidden violence

The divine can only initially impact us under a disguise, using sacrificial elements and hidden violence. (193 words)


## Chapter 13 Satan

**Girard's Interpretation of Satan**

**Satan as Personification of Order and Disorder**:
- Satan represents both order and disorder
- Order: embodies self-organizing system that keeps mimesis within bounds
- Disorder: order is based on a lie, controlled through victimage and scapegoating

**The Christian Revelation Exposes Satan**:
- Reveals Satan as "the father of lies"
- Exposes innocence of victims, including Jesus

**Satan's Attempt to Cast Out Satan**:
- Through collective violence and murder
- But defeated by the Cross

**The Disciples Break Away from Mimetics Consensus**:
- With the aid of the Paraclete, the Spirit of God as defender of the falsely accused

**Jesus' Question About Satan**:
- "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
- Answer: Passion is Satan's attempt to expel Jesus, seen as another Satan

**Our Puzzlement with Satan and Expelling Him**:
- Modern period prides itself on superior knowledge and rationality
- But the solution may be found in the Gospels and the Passion


### Collective violence in the Gospels: Passion and John the Baptist's beheading.

**Collective Violence in the Gospels**

**Introduction:**
- Passion of Christ not isolated event in Gospels
- Surrounded by acts of collective or collectively inspired violence

**Parable of the Vineyard**:
- Collective expulsion and killing of messengers sent by the owner
- Last messenger, Jesus' death, is unique in victim identity but similar to previous acts of violence

**Prophets and Collective Violence**:
- "You have killed all the prophets... now you are going to kill me" (Matthew 23:29-30)
- "The righteous blood of all the prophets shed on the earth" (Matthew 27:28)
- "From the foundation of the world, the blood of Abel the just was shed" (Luke 11:51)
- Collective violence presented as worldwide phenomenon since ancient times

**Collective Violence in Other Gospels Accounts**:
- Beheading of John the Baptist (Matthew 14:1-12, Mark 6:14-29, Luke 3:19-20, 7:25)
- Process behind deaths of Jesus and John resembles polarization and crowd involvement

**Conclusion**:
- Understanding the type of violence as a whole is essential for correct interpretation of Passion account.


### Mimetic Violence in the Bible: Collective and Individual Conflicts

**Polarization and Mimetic Contagion**

**The Essence of Hostile Polarization**
- The real event: essential phenomenon, not how it is triggered
- Not divinely inspired or ordained by God
- Effects mimetic, like in Greek/Trojan warriors or Salome's dancing

**Salome's Dancing and the Passion**
- Preparation for violent action
- Evil influence rather than divine
- Mimetically possessed crowd
- No counterpart to dance in Jesus' death
- Peter's denial: mimetic pressure, typical vulnerability

**Collective Murders and Biblical Prophets**
- Mimetic consensus in the Gospels
- Suffering Servant dies at hands of united community
- Jonah's whale: collective casting out, mimetic nature
- Hobbes' Leviathan: many small-scale conflicts

**Mimetic Violence and Satan**
- Collective violence has mimetic dimension
- Individuals can exhibit mimetic behavior too
- Satan involved in smaller-scale conflicts.


### Mimetic desire: Imitating Jesus or Satan, leading to rivalry and addiction.

**Mimetic Desire and Rivalry**
- **Satan**: imitates God, but in a spirit of rivalry
- **Jesus**: imitates God in a spirit of childlike and innocent obedience
- Mimetic desire is the foundation of both, leading to rivalry between subjects desiring the same object

**The Concept of Skandalon**
- Biblical term for an obstacle that simultaneously attracts and repels
- Represents a destructive addiction, such as drugs, sex, power, or morbid competitiveness
- Attraction increases with suffering or irritation caused by the object

**Modern Translations vs. Original Meaning**
- Modern translations fail to convey the idea of something that causes stumbling and addiction
- Older translations, like "stumbling block" in English and "pierre d'achoppement" in French, more accurately capture the concept

**Implications for Christians**
- The skandalon is a common issue in Christian communities, often discredited as outdated or puritanical
- However, it represents a significant idea that modern psychoanalyses and psychopathologies try to address unsuccessfully.


### Jesus and scandals: Conflictual relationships and participation in the Passion.

**Scandals: A Force for Order**

**The Nature of Scandals:**
- Jealousy is the true reason behind slander against Jesus and his disciples
- Scandals proliferate, causing crisis and giving the illusion that the world will end
- Scandals are permanently conflictual relationships in our individual lives
- We tend to view scandals as authentic modalities of human existence, personal and unique
- However, Jesus sees scandals as mimetic from the start, becoming more impersonal and anonymous over time
- Scandals can substitute for one another without awareness on our part
- The operation of scandals is similar to demonic or satanic possession

**Jesus' Perspective:**
- Jesus feels differently about scandals than his disciples
- He understands that scandals are mimetic and become more so during times of exasperation
- Beyond a certain threshold, scandals will turn into a force for order

**Application to Disciples:**
- The word "scandal" applies to all degrees of participation in the Passion
- Peter's active persecution is different from the passive complicity of other disciples
- Both forms of participation are aspects of scandals and the mimetic consensus against Jesus.


### Mimetic desire and unanimous violence in the crowd's scandals.

**The Scandal of Peter and the Mimetically Transmitted Desires**
- **Peter's Initial Reaction**: Scandalized by Jesus' announcement of suffering, tries to instill worldly success ideal on his master
- **Mimetic Desire Transfer**: Satan operates by transferring mimetic desires from disciple to master; Peter's behavior is a result of both preexisting scandal (mimetic) and crowd's mimetic push
- **Massive Transference of Scandals**: As the target becomes more numerous, their attractiveness as a target increases, leading to collective violence
- **Scandal Bridges Individual and Collective Violence**: Unanimity of violence results in guilt of victim becoming absolute certainty for participants and expulsion/destruction experienced as personal liberation
- **Effects of Mimetic Consensus**: Agitation subsides, producing a peace rooted in the mimetic consensus; unholy communion between persecutors (Herod and Pilate) after Jesus' trial

**The Unanimous Collective Murder: The Passion of Christ**
- **Disciples Initially Contaminated**: Disciples almost become part of the consensus, but eventually break away
- **Attention in Gospels**: More focus on Christian communion around resurrected Jesus than on unholy communion of persecutors; Luke mentions an instance of this unholy communion between Herod and Pilate (Luke 23:12)


### Christianity vs. Mimetic Communion: The role of Paraclete in disrupting false accusations and social violence.

**Mimetic Communion vs. Christian Communion**

**Historical Significance**:
- No significant historical information provided

**Effects on Participants**:
- Mimetic communion: passionate rejection and critique of the other communion's uncritical espousal of guilt of the victim
- Christian communion: based on the rejection of false accusations, understanding that they are false

**Origins and Significance of Names**:
- Satan: originally means "the accuser", brings lawsuits against someone else
- Paraclete: Greek word for "lawyer for the defense", defender of victims

**Jesus and the First Paraclete**:
- Jesus is the first Paraclete, who disrupts the mimetic consensus against the most innocent victim (himself)

**Modern World Perceptions**:
- Absence or disguise of Christian origin in understanding the difference between mimetic communion and Christian communion
- "Scapegoat" used instead of acknowleding the real source of insight into social violence

**Satan Casting Out Satan**:
- Collective violence of the Passion and similar murders converge on an irrelevant or innocent victim, establishing a consensus at their expense
- Order born from this process is less violent than disorder it overcomes but still violent and unjust


### Paradoxical role of Satan in human order and transcendence in the Gospels.

**Understanding Satan as a Self-Organizing System**
* Satan represents both the exorcised demon and the exorcist in the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke)
* Not a logical impossibility but a mythological concept
* Self-organizing systems: complex entities with principles of order and disorder intertwined
* When disorder reaches a certain threshold, forces for disruption become reintegration and reordering
* Satan is a self-organizing system in the Gospels
* Jesus' question "How can Satan cast out himself?" emphasizes the paradoxical oneness of order and disorder
* Unique to the Gospels: both religious illusion and social reality are rooted in the same source, not directly divine
* Labels for these powers: "the powers of this world," "celestial powers," "thrones," "dominations," "principalities," "rulers of this world," "angels," and "Satan"
* United in their decision to crucify Jesus, representing the mimetically rooted murder in which they are inevitably involved.


### Satan as the originator of human culture and collective murder in Christianity.

**Modern Christianity's Two Great Temptations**

**The Divinization of the Social Order**:
- Reactionary Christian thinkers like Joseph de Maistre and Carl Schmitt divinized the social order

**The Divinization of Social Disorder and Revolution**:
- This current is still ongoing, with a focus on liberation
- These two currents oppose each other fiercely but are fundamentally similar

**Modernism as a Distortion of Christianity**:
- The belief that society is everything, reducing religion to political and social questions
- This is a "distortion and mutilation of Christianity"

**The Gospels' View on Satan and Human Culture**:
- The connection between the first collective murder and the foundation of human culture is significant
- The story of Cain illustrates this vision
- The Gospels view Satan as the principle, if not the entire reality, of human culture since the foundation of the world

**Linking Satan to the Foundation of Human Culture**:
- The Synoptic Gospels do not have such a text, but John's Gospel provides an obscure but rich one
- This text sums up and completes the doctrine regarding Satan and the founding murder, which is consistent across all four Gospels

**Reading in the Context of Mankind as a Whole**:
- The previous texts must be read in the context of Judaism and mankind as a whole


### Satan's lies and human history's cycles of order and disorder.

**The Devil and the Primordial Lie**

**The Meaning of "Devil" and "Satan"**:
- Means the same as "the foundation of the world" (katabolē tou kosmou) - the origin of human culture, not creation ex nihilo.
- Represents the collective lie that has enveloped mankind since its earliest civilizations.

**The Primordial Lie and Human Will**:
- The "devil" is alien to all truth because he was a **murderer from the beginning**.
- Satan's lie is his **false accusation** and the unanimous conviction that the victim is really guilty.
- Men are forever rooted and re-rooted in the foundational violence that makes a vicarious removal of scandals possible.

**The Cycle of Order and Disorder**:
- When disorder of scandals gets worse, it automatically brings back the unanimous victimage that generates a new order or regenerates the old.
- Human history before the Christian revelation has been an endless alteration of order and disorder in all parts of the world.
- Ancient theories of the Eternal Return contain some truth, but cannot discover the engine that powers these cycles - the foundational power of the mimetic consensus or generative scapegoating.

**The Shift from Circular to Linear Time**:
- The end of this circular time, the shift from an eternally recurring world to a time which has a real beginning and a real end, is inseparable from the revelation of the force that until then had powered the cycles.
- This shift represents the **decisive defeat for Satan**, the end of his kingdom, which follows logically from the mimetic interpretation.


### Christianity's victory over Satan: Revealing the hidden lie of mythical origins and dissipating the darkness.

**The Idea of Satan as Defeated by the Cross**

**Satan's Power**:
- Dependent on a lie that must be firmly believed by all men to remain effective
- This untruth, or satanic lie, must be hidden and protected from human curiosity

**Mythological Origins of Satan**:
- Initial darkness springs from collective madness and hallucination of the transferential runaway and unanimous violence
- The violence at the heart of myth resembles the violence of the Passion, but the victim is always guilty
- Later, this darkness gives way to more decorous forms of befuddlement and self-deception - philosophies and ideologies

**Sophisticated Darkness of Modern Knowledge**:
- Continuous with the darkness of mythology
- Relies more and more on mythological expression, such as the Oedipus myth

**The Christian Revelation and Satan's Defeat**:
- Dissipates the darkness of the founding murder by showing the innocence of all victims, not just Jesus
- Undermines Satan's power, slowly at first but then faster and faster
- Mankind is no longer in bondage to Satan, thanks to the Cross

**The Secret Revealed**:
- The Gospels force out of hiding the secret of one collective murder typical of all human culture
- The spotlight on Satan makes it impossible for him to fool humanity any longer
- Once the secret is revealed, it loses all its value and looks pathetic compared to its historical effects

**Paul's Struggle to Define the Secret**:
- Paul never quite manages to define this secret
- The words he needs simply do not exist


### The Cross disarms Satan by revealing his deceptive scapegoat mechanism.

**The Metaphor of Legal Documents and Satan's Defeat**

**Background:**
- No appropriate vocabulary for what is being said
- Colossians 2:13-15 provides insight into question of victims, Satan, and the Cross

**Satan as Prosecutor and Defense Lawyer (Paraclete)**
- Legal tinge given to the question of victims
- Satan's power reduced to nothing by the Cross

**The Nailing of the Document to the Cross**
- Principalities and powers defeated, ridiculed
- Revealing Satan's secret: mimetic process behind death of Jesus and John the Baptist

**Understanding Satan's Defeat through the Cross**
- Jesus reveals Satan's secret, becoming intolerable source of disorder
- Satan sets trap to silence Jesus by mimetic murder and scapegoat mechanism
- Disciples provide world with truthful account of what should remain hidden: 1 Corinthians 2:7-8

**The Rulers of This Age (Satan and the Powers)**
- Crucifixion deprives them of powerful tool: scapegoat mechanism
- Had they known, would have protected it instead of crucifying Jesus
- Became hypocritical lawyers for the defense, imitating Jesus in a satanic way.


### The Cross' victory over Satan transformed Western attitude towards victims in history.

**The Idea of Victory in the Cross**

**Modern Commentators' Perspective**:
- Reduce New Testament thinking to "vulgar propaganda"
- See first Christians as power-hungry and narcissistic
- Criticize the idea that an ignominious death like the Cross is a victory over Satan

**Precedents in Christian Thought**:
- Some illustrious Christian predecessors also criticized this theme
- Eastern fathers emphasized the magical aspect, which Western fathers found unsatisfactory

**The Significance of the Cross**:
- Reveals the mimetic violence at the root of human society
- Leads to a growing concern for victims everywhere in the world
- Represents a unique modern attitude toward victims that does not exist in other cultures

**Modern History and the Victory of the Cross**:
- Dominated by the consequences of the victory defined by Jesus, Paul, and others
- Continuously uncovering new hidden victims of society, with the consensus against them dissolving over time

**Examples of Uncovered Victims**:
- Slaves
- Lower classes
- People of different ethnicities


### The role of victims in human history: Victimization, persecution, and liberation from Satan's influence.

**The Importance of Victims in Defining Our World**

**Modern World's Ongoing Struggle with Injustice**:
- Victimization of ethnic groups, women, handicapped people, young and old
- Mimetic violence has had a powerful influence on history and the modern world
- Inequality and arbitrariness still exist, despite efforts to conceal them

**Perversion of Concern for Victims**:
- Constant attempt by groups/individuals to usurp victimized position
- Transformation of concern for victims into an instrument of power and persecution

**Christianity's Perspective on Victims**:
- Gospels present the Christian future as full of division and strife
- Christ brings a sword, not peace
- Devil (Satan) is defeated by the Cross, but his power of disorder remains

**Eschatological and Apocalyptic Themes**:
- Whatever happening to our world ultimately means it is good
- Negation of Satan is only bad when accompanied by minimization of mimetic contagion


### Reevaluating the power and relevance of Satan in the Gospels.

Focus on Satan in the Gospels for modern perspective; overcoming shame.

Once fearful of Satan, Christians now ashamed, censoring him from Scriptures. Instead, we should emphasize his power and relevance as a critique of myths.

Gospels offer rich, modern perspectives on Satan that challenge archaic beliefs.


## Chapter 14 The Question of Anti-Semitism in the Gospels

**The Question of Anti-Semitism in the Gospels**

**Background:**
- Accusation of anti-Jewishness in New Testament Gospels by biblical critics, feminist critics, and intellectuals
- Anticipated by Nietzsche who saw Christianity as opposing power and authority, focusing on truth and concern for the weak
- Recent postmodern theology and criticism have continued this discussion

**Girard's Essay:**
- Published under title "Is There Anti-Semitism in the Gospels?" in Biblical Interpretation 1 (1993)
- Reveals things hidden since foundation of human culture, exposing murders since Cain and Abel
- Primary focus is not to indict Jews for Jesus' fate but to critique narrowly anti-Jewish readings

**Discussion on Anti-Semitism:**
- Discussions should focus on deeper meanings, not matters of speech like "the Jews" vs. specific religious groups
- In Gospels, mimetic rivalry, crowd contagion, and need for order involve primarily Jewish people and Romans

**Nietzsche's Perspective:**
- Christianity inculcates desire for truth and identification with the plight of others
- Destroying itself due to resentment towards powerful figures
- Understanding founding murder is crucial in interpreting Gospels.


### Exploring collective violence in the Gospels: Jewish accusations and the parable of the winemakers.

**Issue Surrounding Accusations Against Jews in Gospels**
- Main focus: large body of texts accusing Jews of preparing to kill Jesus before Passion
- Evidence includes: "Curses against the Pharisees," parable of the murderous winemakers, and certain texts in John's Gospel (e.g., accusations of being sons of the devil)

**Text Analysis:**
- Jews are not the only group attacked in these texts
  - Genesis references: blood "shed from the foundation of the world" (Matthew and Luke's epi tēs gēs)
    * This expression means on the earth, all over the earth
    * If murders were committed worldwide, Jews cannot be sole responsibility
- Implications:
  * Possible anti-Jewish bias in Gospels due to emphasis on Jewish involvement in killing holy men
  * However, not all instances of murder mentioned in Gospels involve Jews
  * Worldwide scope of some references suggests broader cultural commentary

**Parable of the Murderous Winemakers:**
- Jews are accused of collectively killing messengers sent by vineyard owner (prophets)
  - Owner's son, representing Jesus, is also killed
- Featured in debate about potential anti-Jewish bias in Gospels due to Jewish targeting
- Collective violence towards messengers suggests a larger commentary on human culture and behavior.


### Comparing the beheading of John the Baptist to Jesus' crucifixion: Mimetic polarization in biblical murders.

**Comparative Analysis of Murder Accounts in Gospels**

**The Passion and the Beheading of John the Baptist**:
- Both portrayals depict a polarization or mobilization of many people against a victim
- Until the moment of the murder, the victims had not aroused hostility from their future murderers
- The main phenomenon is a **polarization** of the crowd against the victim
- This occurs after being **initiated by a few instigators or one person**: religious leaders in the case of Jesus, Herodias in the case of John
- The causes are **mimetic**: people are carried away and possessed by events (e.g., Salome's dance) that mimic the desire to unite against the victim

**Peter's Denial**:
- Peter, who had the greatest spiritual investment in Jesus, denies him out of a desire to conform to the crowd's contempt
- This demonstrates how even the most committed individuals can be vulnerable to **mimetic polarizations**

**Conclusion**:
- The Gospels suggest that all the violent murders mentioned are similar to the crucifixion and beheading of John, resulting from **mimetic polarizations**


### Mimetic desire and human society's foundation in collective violence (Gospels)

**Mimetic Contagion and Imitation in the Gospels**

**Background:**
- Pilate's handling of Jesus reflects an anti-Jewish or pro-Roman bias? Unlikely due to parallel handling of Herod/John the Baptist relationship.
- Sovereign's subservience to the crowd manifested in both scenes, showing crowd as supreme power.

**Crowd and Political Power:**
- Foundation of the world rooted in first murder (Genesis) and first culture (Cain).
- Human society began with mimetic murders like the Passion.
- Mimetic rivalry arises from shared desire for object, leading to potential violence.

**Imitation and Imitators:**
- Jesus and Satan as teachers of imitation; humans always imitate God.
- Imitation recommended by Jesus as long as it doesn't cause acquisitive desire or mimetic rivalry.
- Mimetic rivalry can lead to envy, jealousy, pride, anger, despair (skandalon).

**Key Concepts:**
- Human beings imitate God through Jesus or Satan.
- Imitation is intrinsically good but can cause mimetic rivalry and sin when relentlessness makes it obsessive.


### The text explores the concept of "skandalon" as a source of intersubjective destructive addiction and social unrest.

**The Concept of Skandalon: An Obstacle Causing Repeated Stumbling**

**Definition**:
- Biblical term meaning an obstacle that one keeps stumbling against
- Derived from a Greek word signifying "to limp"

**Characteristics and Effects**:
- Results from human failure to avoid mimetric rivalry
- Leads to destructive addictions (e.g., drugs, sex, power, morbid competitiveness)
- Substitutes for one another as they multiply and intensify
- Becomes impersonal, anonymous, and interchangeable
- Contagiousness ensures endless proliferation
- Causes society to disintegrate, requiring a counterforce for control

**Scandals and Individuals**:
- Scandals begin small but can grow very large
- People seek public substitutes to unburden themselves
- As more join, the common victim's attractiveness increases, leading to collective violence
- The victim becomes the embodiment of all scandals, resulting in personal liberation for participants

**Jesus' Teachings**:
- Warned his disciples that he would become a scandal to them
- Represents the mimetic tidal wave that affects individuals
- In the case of Peter, the contamination and unanimity of violence can be followed in great detail among other disciples.


### The foundation of society through scapegoat sacrifices and collective violence.

**The Significance of Scapegoating in Society**

**The Cross as a Spectacle**:
- Pilate surrenders to the crowd after the Crucifixion
- All agitation subsides, and the mob peacefully disperses
- The crowd is appeased at the expense of an innocent victim

**Scapegoating as a Mechanism for Relief**:
- Scandals may be dependent on periodical evacuations through successful scapegoating
- The concept of a "scapegoat" is borrowed from the Bible, referring to the process itself

**The Rejection of the Stone**:
- Jesus refers to the scapegoating process in the parable of the vineyard
- The "stone that the builders rejected has become the keystone" metaphor applies to all religious and cultural institutions
- This understanding challenges the uniqueness of Christianity as a scapegoat religion

**Comparative Anthropology and Modernist Movements**:
- Comparative anthropologists showed that the overall Christian scheme is similar to archaic religions
- Rationalist conception of Christianity as mythical, confirmed by the modernist movement
- The disintegration of faith through the suspicion of anti-Semitism in the Gospels


### Understanding Scapegoat Consensus in Religion: Christians vs. Blind Acceptance of Founding Murder

**Primitive Gods, Primordial Heroes, Sacred Kings, and Founding Ancestors:**
- Keystones in various territories
- Confirm structural similarities between Christian revelation and countless other cults
- Christians have exaggerated uniqueness of Passion's violence against Jews
- Fearful tendency to postpone crisis of faith within Christianity

**Division after the Passion:**
- Large group united against Jesus: religious and political leaders, crowd
- Small group of first Christians: passionate conviction that Jesus is innocent, vindicated by God
- Christians reject founding murder, unlike other religions

**Scapegoating:**
- Religious epiphanies rooted in scapegoat processes
- Scapegoats seen as monsters of iniquity, expulsion necessary for community survival
- Gratitude and reverence may make them divine.


### Christianity's rejection of scapegoating as a religious foundation.

**Scapegoating in Myths and Religions**

**Principles of Scapegoating**:
- Dependent on a previous belief in power as troublemakers
- Guilty appearance before immolation, reverence afterwards
- Effectiveness of unanimous scapegoating

**Myths and Rituals**:
- Many conform to scapegoat pattern: malevolent/dangerous victims
- Others evolve, covering over initial "against" with benevolence

**Christianity vs. Other Religions**:
- Gospels denounce founding violence as evil, not sacred
- Reject scapegoating as a basis for religious epiphany
- Scapegoat mechanism cannot be explicitly stated in texts

**Scapegoating in the Gospels**:
- Jesus and Caiaphas's definition: necessary, justified by higher good
- Denounced as lie, not sacred truth or divine unity
- Vicarious immolation without goat's "ugliness" or injustice

**Scapegoating Criticisms**:
- Modern usage of "scapegoat" defines a principle of collective self-deception
- Cannot be expressed in texts that structure it
- Misinterpreted evidence by critics as scapegoat "theme" or "motif"


### Critique of anti-Jewish misinterpretations in Christian texts: Freud and scapegoating.

**Freud and the Oedipus Complex**

**Overview**:
- Discussion of Freud's relationship to the concept of the Oedipus complex
- Comparison to Nietzsche and Lévi-Strauss

**Misunderstanding of Gospels**:
- Accusation of anti-Jewishness is false
- Reveals violent origin of human societies
- Anti-Jewish reading is reason for misunderstanding
- Triggers relapse into scapegoating at expense of Jews
- Violence in Passion seen as superhuman or indictment of Jews
- Dissolution of contaminated Christianity leads to Christian anti-Semitism
- Needed: critique of narrowly anti-Jewish reading, not indictment of Gospels

**Scapegoating the Texts**:
- Christians may feel guilt regarding their own anti-Semitism
- Believe they were misled by religion, not responsible for scapegoating
- Effort to elude substance of Gospels ends up scapegoating the text

**Freud and Oedipus Complex**:
- Discussion of Freud's focus on this concept
- Comparison to other thinkers: Nietzsche, Lévi-Strauss.


## Chapter 15 Freud and the Oedipus Complex

**Girard's Engagement with Freud and Nietzsche:**
* Passionate engagement led to significant contribution to mimetic theory (Violence and the Sacred)
* Critique of Lévi-Strauss: "Lévi-Strauss, Structuralism, and Marriage Laws" (223-49) and "Differentiation and Reciprocity in Lévi-Strauss and Contemporary Theory" (155-77)
* Influence from Freud's Totem and Taboo: primordial murder of the father by brothers, incest prohibition, and Oedipus complex
* Importance of Girard's critique of Oedipus complex in Violence and the Sacred (169-185)
	+ Initial attempt to develop Oedipus complex based on mimetic desire
	+ Abandonment of mimetic theory for sexual or libidinal theory
	+ Identification with father and libidinous attraction to mother: strange duality
	+ Failure led to basis on purely cathectic desire, reserving mimetic effect for superego
* Girard's mimetic hypothesis is free of sexual bias (Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego)

**Freud's Oedipus Complex:**
* Initial attempt to develop from mimetic desire
* Abandonment in favor of purely cathectic desire and superego
* Identification with father and libidinous attraction to mother: strange duality (Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego)
* Ambivalence and death instinct as attempt to resolve rivalry and identification (Violence and the Sacred, 169-185)

**Girard's Critique of Freud:**
* Criticizes abandonment of mimetic theory in favor of sexual or libidinal theory
* Argues for importance of identification in understanding human reactions, relations, and origins (Violence and the Sacred, 169-185)
* Mimesis or mimetic desire is a key concept: not biased towards genetic heritage, preordained structure, or universal family situation.


### Mimetic desire: Conflict, rivalry, and obscure Freudian concepts.

**Mimetic Structure and Capacity in Human Condition**
- **Universal aspect**: mimetic structure and capacity of human beings
- Model or mediators required for desire
- Not predetermined which humans or objects are desired
- Frequent feminist critique: "androcentric" or "patriarchal"
  - Not based on thorough engagement with Girard's concept of mimesis
  - Politically influenced assessment of text

**Comparison with Freud's Oedipus Complex**
- Similarities and differences in mimetic desire and Freudian theory
- Mimetism leads to rivalry, violence
- Freud's work touches on this mechanism but fails to fully dominate his thinking
- Psychoanalysts avoid focusing on the subject of mimetic desire
  - Due to opposing factions: inconsistencies in Freud's work vs. psychologism rejection

**Mimetic Intuition in Freud's Work**
- Ambiguous, obscure, and vague concepts related to mimetic desire
- Identification as one offshoot of this ill-defined mimetic desire
  - Discussed in "Identification" chapter of Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego.


### Freud's theory on filial identification and mimetic desire in child development.

**Identification with the Father**
- A little boy exhibits special interest in his father
- He wants to grow like and be like him, take his place everywhere
- Behavior is typically masculine, not passive or feminine
- Preparation for Oedipus complex

**Similarities between Identification and Mimetic Desire**
- Both involve choice of a model
- Model is not necessarily the natural father
- Mimetic model directs disciple's desire to particular object
- Implication: identification rooted in third party's desire, not subject or object

**Realization of Active Identification**
- Either wholly imaginary or takes concrete form as desire for specific object
- Son seeks to take father's place everywhere, assuming his desires
- Proof that mimetic process influences filial desire (Freud: identification fits well with Oedipus complex)

**Conflict between Identification and Sexual Cathexis**
- Identification presented as fundamental to boy's development, anterior to any object choice
- Conflict between this mimetic process and autonomous sexual cathexis toward mother.


### Freud's interpretation of Oedipus complex and identification with paternal desire.

**Freud's Analysis of Oedipus Complex**
- Freud emphasizes identification with father as first step in developing sexual cathexis toward mother
- Two factors contributing to object choice: identification (mimesis) and fixation of libido on mother
  * Identification reinforces each other, strengthening the libidinal drive
  * Natural and logical turn of events if we regard this as mimesis of paternal desire
- Freud's definition of Oedipus complex: son notices father as obstacle to his mother; identification with father becomes hostile and fused with wish to replace father in her affections.
  * Implicit exclusion of mother from program initially, but this is not explicitly stated in Freud's text.

**Freud's Definition of Identification:**
- Son exhibits interest in and desire to grow like and be like his father, taking his place everywhere
  * Father directs son's attention to desirable objects through his own desires
  * Desires are inevitably directed toward own mother.


### Freud's evolving perspective on Oedipus complex and identification.

**Freud's Text Implications**
* Mimetic interpretation implied but never explicitly stated in Freud's text (Chapter 7, "Identification")
* Hidden meaning of "as well" retrospectively neuterlizes any mimetic interpretation of identification, especially towards the mother
* Freud's eagerness to dispel mimetic elements from Oedipus theory evident in his later work

**Oedipus Complex Definition (The Ego and the Id, 1923)**
1. Early age, boy develops object cathexis for mother
2. Identification with father:
   - Initially neutral
   - Later becomes hostile and changes into wish to get rid of father to take place with mother
3. Ambivalent relation towards father
4. Differences between earlier and later text on Oedipus complex:
   - Mimetic elements banished entirely from later definition
   - Anteriority of identification with the father not explicitly repudiated but given less emphasis
   - Sexual attraction to mother mentioned before identification with father
5. Inversion of original order in second text, reinforcement of sexual wish presented as a consequence instead of a cause
6. Formally rejects cause-and-effect relationship suggested initially.


### Freud's abandoned exploration of mimetic desire and its impact on Oedipus complex.

**The Absence of Libido Reinforcement**
- The effect is retained, but the cause (libido reinforcement) is lacking
- This results in a lack of coherence and understanding

**Freud's Ban on Mimesis**
- In "The Ego and the Id", Freud discards mimesis, sacrificing insights from "Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego"
- The reason for this ban is to avoid contradicting his Oedipus complex theory

**Identification and Mimetic Rivalry**
- Identification: son wants to be like/replace father
- Father's possessions, including the mother, are the son's "objects"
- Disciples' movements towards models' objects explained by identification
- Model and disciple will inevitably have rivalry over these shared objects
- Rivalry is not fortuitous or a question of usurpation, but predetermined by the model's choice
- The son responds to cultural command and the model's example in seeking to take father's place with the mother

**Consequences of Mimetic Rivalry**
- Reciprocal violence is a logical result of mimetic rivalry, similar to but different from Oedipal complex consequences.


### Childhood vulnerability and the traumatic impact of adult modeling on mimetic desire.

**Early Childhood and Reciprocity**
- **Reciprocity**: result of a process, not present in early childhood
- Children are vulnerable due to lack of reciprocal understanding
- Adults react to violent situations with violence; children reach out innocently
- Misinterpretation of child's actions comes from cultural systems

**Model-Disciple Relationship**
- Precludes sense of equality and rivalry
- Disciple imitates model's desires, unable to recognize connection
- Fails to grasp that he can compete with or threaten the model

**First Encounter with Mimetic Desire**
- Child's first no may be misunderstood as irrevocable act of excommunication
- Child incapable of meeting violence with violence, has limited experience with it
- First intervention by model is traumatic due to disciple's inability to understand

**Incest and Patricide Wishes**
- Do not belong to the child but originate from adult/model's mind
- Child is last to learn of these desires, adults attempt to enlighten him

**Intellectual Operation Assigned by Freud**
- Disciples unable to see model as rival, fail to perform assigned intellectual operation
- Adult disciple also struggles with this perception

**Model's Anger and Disciple's Response**
- Disciple feels compelled to choose between himself and the model
- He will always choose in favor of the model.


### Freud's theory of desire and rivalry challenged: child's awareness of conflicts not clear cut.

**The Idol's Wrath and Justification**
- The idol's wrath is justified by a failure on the disciple's part
- This guilt increases the prestige of the divinity
- Desire is redirected towards protected objects, forging a link between desire and violence

**Freud's Perspective**
- Freud wants to show that an impression is made on the child when they discover their own desires overlapping those of their parents
- Freud rejected mimetic elements in favor of a different approach

**Rivalry and Jealousy**
- The little boy notices his father as a rival, but this assumption is unlikely for most children
- Adults often fail to attribute mutual antagonisms to jealousy or imitation

**Critique of Freud's Assumptions**
- Assertion that the child is fully aware of rivalry is untenable
- Child may not recognize father as a rival in the sense of desire duplication
- This critique challenges psychoanalytical orthodoxy but offers valuable insights into the evolution of Freudian doctrine.


### Freud's attachment to consciousness and the inadequacy of unconscious concepts.

**Critique of Freudianism**

**Clinical Findings**:
- Cannot serve as evidence for transitory consciousness of patricidal or incestuous desire
- Clinical observation cannot yield such a consciousness

**Freud's Concepts**:
- **Unconscious**: unwieldy and dubious concept to explain the nonconscious nature of impulses determining psychological make-up
- **Suppression**: Freud obliged to devise due to refusal of conscious awareness of patricidal and incestuous desire

**Principal Complaint**:
- Attachment to a philosophy of consciousness in Freudianism
- Mythical element founded on conscious knowledge of patricidal and incestuous desire, though briefly experienced
- Compels abandonment of logic and credibility

**Unconscious and Consciousness**:
- Unobstructed consciousness offers no important information
- Serve to obscure the mimetic process, which has advantages over Freudian "complex"

**Mimetic Approach**:
- Offers a novel approach to psychiatric theory
- Circumvents fetish of "adjustment" and avoids inverse fetish of "perversion" typical of modern theory
- Individuals divide contradictory injunctions of the double bind into two different domains to neutralize it.


### Freud's psychoanalysis and the mimetic double bind: contradictory identifications and paternal obstacles.

**Societal Adjustment and Concealed Violence**
- **Primitive Cultures**: At origin of "adjustment" lies arbitrary violence
- **Well-Adjusted Person**: Conceals violent impulses, condones collective concealment
- **"Maladjusted" Individual**: Cannot tolerate this concealment, commits to falsehoods and forms of violence

**Psychoanalytic Perspective**
- Many psychic catastrophes misunderstood by psychoanalysts result from reaction against societal violence and falsehood
- Freudian mode of thought does not recognize these concerns as relevant to psychoanalysis
- Mimetic double bind: "Act like your model / do not act like your model" - contradictory double imperative fundamental to Freud's insights

**Freud's Ego and Id**
- The relation between the ego and superego is not exhausted by the precept "You ought to be like this (like your father)"
- It also comprises the prohibition "You may not be like this (like your father) - that is, you may not do all that he does; some things are his prerogative"
- Freud's definition of the superego presupposes something different from a mythical consciousness of rivalry
- It seems based on the model's identification with the obstacle, an identification unperceived by the disciple
- The superego is a resumption of identification with the father, appearing chronologically after the Oedipus complex rather than before it.


### Freud's Superego: Conflicting Identification and Mimetic Effects.

**Freud's Concept of Superego:**
* Freud did not suppress previous identification but relegated it to secondary status
* Identification with father becomes superego after complex takes hold
* Definition of superego aligns with concept of double bind and contradicts unconscious Oedipus complex
* Son's initial act of imitation performed with fervor, rewarded by disgrace
* Son struggles to understand contradictory commands, terror ensues
* Freud toys with mimetic effects in Superego definition despite earlier rejection
* Evolution of thoughts from Group Psychology (1921) to The Ego and the Id (1923):
  * Initially believed possible to reconcile mimetic effect with main thesis, Oedipus complex
  * Sensed incompatibility between two themes during composition
  * Clear contradiction between superego definition and unconscious Oedipus complex.


### Freud's struggle with the interplay of Oedipus complex and mimesis in desire.

**Freud's Approach to Mimesis vs. Oedipus Complex**

**Mimetic Process**:
- Detaches desire from predetermined objects
- Eliminates consciousness of patricide-incest and desire for it

**Oedipus Complex**:
- Fixes desire on maternal object
- Based on consciousness of patricide-incest desire

**Freud's Decision**:
- Opted for Oedipus complex over mimetic concept
- Suppressed effects of mimesis to prevent it from subverting his ideas
- Attempted to develop Oedipus complex based on both cathectic and mimetic desires, but failed
- Based ultimate version of the complex on purely cathectic desire, reserving mimetic effect for superego

**Duality in Freud's Position**:
- Tried to sever link between cathectic/Oedipal desires and mimetic preoccupations
- Attempt at synthesis failed due to difficulty separating elements of mimetic desire: identification, object choice, rivalry

**Superego and Mimesis**:
- In superego, son's paternal identification is accompanied by upsurge of rivalry for mother object
- Superego derives from need to repress Oedipus complex, which it exists to prevent


### Freud's ambivalent Oedipus complex and the reemergence of mimetic triangle.

**The Mimetic Configuration in Freudian Theory**

**Freud's Unintended Rebuttal of the Oedipus Complex:**
- Father identification reactivates Oedipal triangle (model, disciple, and disputed object)
- Freud struggles to articulate relationship among elements
- Mimetic rivalry haunts his thought

**Ambivalence as Evidence of the Mimetic Pattern:**
- Term frequently appears in Freudian speculation on Oedipus complex
- Represents bitter conflict between disciple and model over shared desire for object

**Initial Presentation of Identification with Father:**
- Not passive or feminine, initially presented as unified relationship
- Later attributed with underlying ambiguity due to change from positive to negative sentiments: despair, guilt, resentment.


### Freud's misunderstanding of mimetic desire: ambivalence vs. model in desire.

**Freud's Misunderstanding of Mimetic Desire**

**Freud's Limitations**:
- Could not accept a concept of desire based on mimesis
- Acknowledged the model in identification as a model of desire, but could not openly acknowledge it
- Took refuge in the idea of ambivalence to explain the effects of mimetic desire

**Effects of Mimetic Desire**:
- Fundamental trait of all human relations
- Universal double bind of imitated desires
- Incomprehensible as individual pathology or psychology
- Ascribed to "physical" causes when deciphered as individual phenomena

**Freud's Use of "Ambivalence"**:
- Attributed conflicts to the "body" instead of the logic of mimetic desire
- Endowed the "physical" with a propensity for clashing with the model-desire
- Gave psychoanalysis a reprieve by reasserting the claims of the physical, rather than demolishing the myth of the individual

**Freud's Discovery of Mimetic Desire**:
- Impeded by his focus on the Oedipus complex
- Perpetuated a traditional, retrogressive concept of desire
- Forced to disregard the model responsible for awakening and designating the object


### Mimetic desire vs. patricide-incest motif in Freudian analysis.

**Mimesis vs. Patricide-Incest Motif**

**Concept of Mimesis**:
- More serviceable than Freudian complex
- Eliminates need for repression of unconscious desire
- Explains Oedipus myth with economy and precision

**Freud's Renunciation of Mimesis**:
- Likely never formally rejected the interpretation
- Kept loyal to patricide-incest motif in his work
- Discovery of mimesis could have led to new insights

**Possible Reasons for Freud's Focus on Patricide-Incest**:
- Unconscious loyalty to this "crucial discovery"
- Prevented him from exploring the path of mimesis
- Mythic nature of patricide-incest motif in Oedipus myth and psychoanalysis

**Impact of Freud's Focus on Patricide-Incest**:
- Dazzled by discovery, prevented further exploration
- Created a "mythic nature" around the theory
- Invoked rebellious spirit when challenged or discussed.


### Critique of Freudian psychoanalysis: erasing mimetic desire from Oedipus complex and superego.

**Freudian Psychoanalysis: A Critique**

**Unsatisfactory Resolutions on Desire**:
- Freud's theories on desire never fully developed into a coherent theory
- His "cathectic" viewpoint prevented him from abandoning object desire
- Various Freudian concepts (castration complex, Oedipus complex, superego, unconscious, repression, ambivalence) are defensive positions in his struggle to resolve the problem of desire

**Freudian Analysis as a Series of Experiments**:
- Freudian analysis should not be viewed as a fully articulated system
- The superego and Oedipus complex are recastings of each other, with differences being purely illusory
- Uncomprehending critics provoked Freud to adopt dogmatic arguments that his followers blindly accepted and opponents rejected

**Post-Freudian Psychoanalysis**:
- Sought to systematize Freudianism by erasing the last traces of mimesis from the Oedipus complex
- Identification with the father is dropped, making the father a disgraced rival
- The supreme remains the venerated model, with no trace of the disgraced rival
- Ambivalence is good for patients but not psychoanalysts
- Rivalry without preliminary identification (Oedipus complex) followed by identification without rivalry (superego)

**Lacan's Observations**:
- The sequence from Oedipus complex to superego is bewildering and does not follow naturally
- Lacan noted this in one of his earliest articles, "Aggression in Psychoanalysis"
- The interest lies not in Freudian results or doctrine but in its challenges to traditional thinking on desire.


### Freud's struggle with understanding the relationships in his psychoanalytic model.

Freud's model, disciple, and common object relationship remained elusive; manipulating any two terms led to the third resurfacing, stifled by disciples as a castrating tactic. (Jacques Lacan, "Ecrits," Seuil, 1966, p. 117)


## Chapter 16 Nietzsche versus the Crucified

**Nietzsche versus The Crucified**

**Background:**
- Both Nietzsche and Girard are "christocentric"
- Departure point: The Crucified as center of history

**Nietzsche's Perspective:**
- End of the Crucified's reign over morality
- Murder of God (The Gay Science, no. 125)
- Beginning of new era
- Understood Christianity as "slave morality" rooted in ressentiment
- Rejected Christian morality as most powerful and baneful combination of conviction and lifestyle in history
- Intuited superior human being, der Übermensch, whose god is Dionysus and transcends ressentiment

**Girard's Perspective:**
- Nietzsche as guide to meaning of Christian revelation
- Understood Christianity from negative perspective to exorcise it from himself
- Jesus brought a sword, the order of charity or love (Pascal)
- Differences between Christ of Gospels and Nietzsche's Dionysus:
  - Jesus: brings a sword, order of charity/love
  - Nietzsche: affirmation of life itself, its eternal fruitfulness and recurrence, creates torment, destruction, will to annihilate.


### Nietzsche's Religious Criticism: Marginalized by Heidegger and French Nietzscheans.

**Nietzsche's Work: Debate and Interpretations**

**Background:**
- Intense debate about Nietzsche's responsibility in Nazi exploitation of his work
- Silence on anti-Christian stance despite its explicitness
- Nietzsche considered important due to various avatars
- Heidegger's impact on interpretations

**Nietzsche's Religious Problematic:**
- Obsession in last lucid years
- Considered irrelevant or embarrassing by contemporary Nietzscheans
- Marginalized when French critics began their work
- Heidegger's influence: incompatibility of religion and thought

**Heidegger's Impact on Interpretations:**
- Essential tenet: mutual incompatibility of religion and thought
- Nietzsche's work condemned as a "return to monotheism"
- Indifference to religion in Heidegger's work
- Model for radical indifference to religion.


### Nietzsche's ressentiment, religious themes, and the complexity of genius.

**Heidegger's Interpretation of Nietzsche and Ressentiment**
- **Heidegger**: saw monotheism as a monopolistic claim on the divine, a form of ressentiment
- Agrees with Heidegger on importance of ressentiment in Nietzsche's work
- Disagrees that religious nonthought and philosophical thought can be easily distinguished
- Believes Heidegger's view of "Dionysus versus the Crucified" as a mere struggle between religions is too narrow
- **Heidegger**: views essential history as postphilosophical, religion irrelevant
- **Nietzsche**: Christian theme becomes more prominent in later works, not a "mutilation" as some may argue
- Fragments dealing with the subject increase in number and importance
- Nietzsche's achievements cannot be separated from ressentiment
- Unlike Heidegger, Nietzsche believed in unique specificity of biblical and Christian perspective.


### Nietzsche's critique of Christianity vs. Dionysian paganism: Violence and sacrifice.

**Nietzsche's Critique of Christianity and Paganism:**
* Nietzsche affirmed the uniqueness of the Bible and New Testament, but opposed it to Christian apologetics (The Ethnocentric Fallacy)
* Nietzsche's critique was based on a less shaky basis than contemporary positivistic equivalence of all religious traditions
* Nietzsche revolted against the shallow assimilation of Judeo-Christianity with paganism
* Christian spirit tries to stifle "life" by repressing dynamic individuals in a culture (The Morality of Slaves vs. The Morality of Masters)
* Culture pays a price for breeding higher men: even the worst forms of violence
* Dionysus accommodates all human passions, including the lust to annihilate and the most ferocious appetite for destruction
* Dionysian violence leaves ruins in its wake (Mania = homicidal fury)
* Nietzsche did not turn Dionysian into something idyllic or inconsequential
* Nietzsche's references to Dionysian violence became more frequent and insistent over time, but often repetitive
* Nietzsche focused on the collective aspect of the god's murder in The Bacchae: a large human group involved.
* Exceptionally, Nietzsche directly focused on the collective aspect of the god's murder (The Will to Power, text number 1052)


### Nietzsche: Dionysus vs. the Crucified - Meaning of Suffering in Religion and Mythology.

**Nietzsche's Attitude Towards Dionysus and the "Crucified"**
- Nietzsche titled a text as "The Two Types: Dionysus and the Crucified"
- Distinction between Dionysus and "Crucified": meaning of suffering
  - Dionysus: life's eternal recurrence, even in torment and destruction
  - "Crucified": suffering as an objection to this life, a formula for its condemnation
- Similarity between collective murders of Dionysus and Jesus
  - Nietzsche felt the two were analogous
  - Insight shared by Freud in "Totem and Taboo"
  - Disappeared from modern anthropology, replaced by interest in culinary preparation

**Anthropological Significance of Collective Sacrificial Dramas**
- Anthropologists discovered the constant presence of collective dramas centering on sacrificial religions
- Dionysus and Jesus as symbols for this phenomenon
  - Not limited to Greek or Indo-European religions, found worldwide
- Important focus for comparative analysis
  - Reveals shared features in various cults
- Nietzsche resorts to Dionysus as a symbol for countless mythological cults.

**Conclusion:**
- Nietzsche's exploration of the similarities between Dionysus and the "Crucified" highlights the significance of collective sacrificial dramas in various religious traditions.
- The discovery of this common motif provided an essential focus for comparative analysis, helping scholars understand the role and meaning of suffering in different religions.


### Comparing religious sacrifices: Dionysus vs Jesus, roles and interpretations differ.

**Religious Anthropology: Nietzsche's Perspective**

**Background:**
- Positivists believed all religions are more or less alike based on shared "facts"
- Nietzsche and Freud rejected this conclusion

**Nietzsche's Viewpoint:**
- Rejected positivism: facts mean nothing without interpretation
- Emphasized the difference between interpretations of religious texts

**Comparison between Dionysus and Jesus:**
- Both involve collective murders or sacrifices
- Christian view focuses on innocence of victim, guilt of murderers
- In Dionysian mythology, god can be both victim and instigator of violence
- Change of roles confirms the indifference of mythology towards biblical morality

**Objection to Nietzsche's View:**
- Some may argue that all instances of dismemberment implicate the Dionysian as condemning violence
- However, this view is not consistent with Nietzsche's opposition to "the Crucified"

**Reinterpretation of Old Myths:**
- Under influence of Bible, murder of little Dionysus became a symbol of human propensity to evil
- This reinterpretation is alien to the original Dionysian mythology as opposed to "the Crucified."


### Nietzsche's perspective on pagan and Christian religions: affirming vs rejecting suffering.

**Nietzsche's Two Types of Religion**

**Pagans**:
- Understand that "life itself, its eternal fruitfulness and recurrence, creates torment, destruction, the will to annihilate"
- Affirm both the best and worst aspects of life

**Christianity (Nietzsche's perspective)**:
- Reject suffering, contrary to Nietzsche's belief in the pagan affirmation of suffering
- Jesus' death was an "objection to life" or a "formula for its condemnation"
- Christian Passion reinterprets religious violence as negative, making perpetrators feel guilty
- Condemns all human culture grounded in collective violence, slandering life itself

**Comparison to Positivistic Anthropology**:
- Nietzsche distinguishes the Christian Passion from other pagan religions, despite similarities in violent acts
- The Bible's interpretation of Cain story is unique and opposes the glorification of murder seen in Roman society.


### Nietzsche: Biblical vs. Mythological Origins of Human Society and Values

**The Irreconcilable Opposition Between Mythology and the Bible**

**Background:**
- Discussion of anthropological origins and their reflection in mythology and the Bible
- Nietzsche's perspective: mythology and Bible represent fundamentally different views

**Mythology vs. Bible**:
- Mythological heroes commit violent acts (Cain, Romulus, Dionysus)
- Bible denounces these actions as untruthful and linked to Satan
- Biblical Gospels connect innocent death of Jesus with collective victims

**Nietzsche's Perspective**:
- Understands opposition between mythology and Bible
- Disgust for bland eclecticism dissolving sharp issues in modernity
- Irreconcilable from ethical and intellectual standpoints

**Impact of Nietzsche**:
- Antidote to turning mythology into a kind of Bible or vice versa
- Highlights irreconcilable opposition between victimizers' perspective (mythology) and victims' side (Bible).


### Nietzsche's complex relationship with ressentiment and vengeance.

**Nietzsche's Thinking and Its Consequences**

**Exonerating Nietzsche**:
- Pious efforts to exonerate Nietzsche from the consequences of his own thinking are misguided
- He himself extended the scope of his judgment to political and ethical questions, providing encouragement for worst ideological aberrations
- Hundreds of texts show that Nietzsche's fierce opposition to the Bible in favor of victims logically led him toward inhuman attitudes in his later years

**Nietzsche's Later Writings**:
- There is a tendency to play hide and seek with Nietzsche's later writings
- It would be more interesting to investigate the inner compulsion that has led so many intellectuals to adopt inhuman standards in the last two centuries
- Nietzsche exemplifies this tendency perfectly

**Ressentiment**:
- **Ressentiment**: The interiorization of weakened vengeance
- Nietzsche suffers so much from it that he mistakes it for the original and primary form of vengeance
- Ressentiment is the child of Christianity, but not its father
- Ressentiment flourishes in a world where real vengeance has been weakened
- The Bible and Gospels have diminished the violence of vengeance and turned it into ressentiment

**Nietzsche's Blindness**:
- Nietzsche was less blind to the role of vengeance in human culture than most people of his time
- However, he was blind to the fact that the evil he was fighting was a relatively minor evil compared to more violent forms of vengeance
- His insight was partly blunted by the deceptive quiet of his post-Christian society
- He could afford the luxury of resenting ressentiment so much that it appeared as a fate worse than real vengeance

**Calling on Dionysus**:
- Nietzsche unthinkingly called on Dionysus to bring back real vengeance, considering it a cure for what seemed to him the worst of all possible fates, ressentiment
- Such frivolity could flourish only in privileged centuries and parts of the world where real vengeance had retreated so much that its terror had become unintelligible.


### The return of real vengeance and the futility of philosophical nihilism.

**The Return of Real Vengeance**

**Prayers for Vengeance Answered**:
- Sincere prayers are never in vain
- Prayers of those who desired vengeance have been heard

**Real Vengeance vs. Ressentiment**:
- **Real vengeance** is back among us in the form of nuclear and other absolute weapons
- This has reduced our planet to a "global primitive village"
- Real vengeance is so awesome that even the most vengeful men dare not unleash it
- Ressentiment (a 19th century concept) pales in comparison to this return of real vengeance

**The Urgent Need for the Gospel Message**:
- At more and more levels, the urgency of the Gospel message cannot be disregarded with impunity
- Those who appeal to real vengeance risk "making the wrong wish and coming to grief when it comes true"

**Disregarding the Return of Real Vengeance**:
- Most people continue to spout 19th century ideas as if the return of real vengeance were not an accomplished fact
- This can lead to a "barrenness of the spirit and a growing sterility in all its 'cultural activities'"

**The Mythological Significance of Nietzsche's Writings**:
- Nietzsche's espousal of mythological violence is more profound than his philosophical games
- Nietzsche's own writings, especially "Dionysus versus the Crucified", reveal his fierce battle to insure the revenge of Dionysus over the Crucified
- This can be heard in the inhuman aspects of Nietzsche's writing at the time, his obligation to justify even the worst forms of oppression and persecution.


### Exploring the complex relationship between Nietzsche, Dionysus, and the sacred.

**Nietzsche's Wager Against Biblical Principle**
* Universal wager against biblical principle seen as perverse
* Violent sacred, or Dionysus, glorified by Nietzsche and Heidegger despite violent nature
* Forces on both sides equally balanced: old sacred vs. destructive force

**Nietzsche's Commitment to the Process**
* Glorified primitive sacred in his work
* Paid a heavy price, including a breakdown
* Identified "sword" that Jesus brought to destroy human culture

**The Battle Between Dionysus and The Crucified**
* Heidegger saw only mimetic rivalry, missing the real difference
* Neutralized Nietzsche's imprudence in religion

**Collective Violence and The Primitive Sacred**
* Role of collective violence in genesis of primitive sacred
* Bible increasing intelligibility of that genesis

**Nietzsche's Paradoxical Involvement**
* Deeply involved but paradoxically in the process he criticized.


### Nietzsche's Madman: The Collective Murder of God and Its Significance

**Nietzsche's Perspective on God's "Death"**

**Skepticism towards the topic**:
- Readers may suspect the focus is on a too idiosyncratic preoccupation of Nietzsche, rather than yielding significant results.
- This attempt should reveal the **real fecundity** and possible contribution of Nietzsche's work to current critical formulae.

**Collective Murder of God**:
- The theme is reminiscent of the story of the madman seeking God in the marketplace.
- Many readers today would not be surprised or scandalized by this approach, as they understand the connection to Nietzsche's text.

**Modern Atheism and God's "Death"**:
- The notion that God is dying a natural death due to modern atheism is only part of the story.
- Nietzsche sees the disappearance of God as a **horrible murder** in which every man is involved: "We have killed him - you and I. All of us are his murderers."

**Existence of Gods**:
- Gods do not have to exist in reality to be murdered. They begin to exist as gods only after being murdered by humanity.


### God's collectively violent death and its religious implications.

**Nietzsche's Concept of God's Death: Collective Murder vs. Peaceful Death**

**Background:**
- Nietzsche felt that the collective crime of killing God was more powerful but harder to communicate
- Emphasized this idea in his text "God is dead"

**Key Points:**
1. **Collective murder of God**: God did not die a natural death; he was collectively killed by humanity
2. **Significance of the crime**: new festivals and sacred games will be invented to atone for this collective murder, making the death of God both its end and origin
3. **Religious implications**: the consequences are religious in nature, as the text describes the collective murder as a religious process rather than putting an end to it
4. **Misunderstandings**: many commentators focus on the "death of God" phrase without acknowledging Nietzsche's emphasis on collective murder, leading to misunderstandings of his true intentions
5. **Drama and power**: the text's dramatic power lies in its description of the collective murder of God, which is often overlooked in favor of more conventional interpretations

**Nietzsche's Genius:**
- Nietzsche took the discussion to its real beginning: the collective murder of God
- Despite misunderstandings, his text remains one of the most memorable on this topic due to its novelty and dramatic power.


### Exploring the hidden impact of Nietzsche's "God is Dead" proclamation and Heidegger's interpretation.

**Nietzsche's "God is Dead" Text**

**Background:**
- Collective unconscious reaction to Nietzsche's quote
- Quoted with excitement but unaware of significance
- Considered an avant-garde version of the Eucharist

**Significance of the Text:**
- Hidden theme: collective murder of God
- Misunderstood as peaceful death or natural occurrence
- Previous attempts to transfer efficacy to other areas failed
- Divine epiphany rooted in a collectively committed crime

**Impact on Religion:**
- Heidegger's perspective: traditional continuation of historicism
- Belief in birth of new god
- Mysterious promise of future divine appearance

**Heidegger's Interpretation:**
- Separate essay from two-volume Nietzsche commentary
- Title reveals effort to reinsert Nietzsche into tradition
- Focuses on end of supra-sensible in Platonic sense
- Overlooked collective murder theme

**Observations:**
- Heidegger's pronouncements continue 19th century historicism
- Belief in future god appearance
- Little attention given to the crime committed collectively.


### A philosophical debate on Nietzsche's "The Death of God" and its implications for religion and modernity.

**Nietzsche's "The Gay Science" and the Death of God**

**Rhetorical Ornamentation**:
- Nietzsche used rhetorical ornaments that were typical of his time, but which a superior thinker would avoid
- This includes alluding to the "death of God," which Heidegger criticized as being "vulgar atheism"

**Heidegger's Interpretation**:
- Heidegger argued that Nietzsche could only be referring to the Christian God when he spoke of "the death of God"
- Heidegger distinguished between "Being" (Sein) and "beings" (Seiende), with the former being eternal and the latter having a finite lifespan
- He believed that new gods may emerge in the future, now that the "twilight of the biblical God" has arrived

**Nietzsche's Shift in Perspective**:
- Nietzsche's shift from speaking about "the death of God" to "his murder" suggests that his preoccupation with this idea was quite significant
- This preoccupation may have been less explicit, but still influential in the development of his thought

**Comparing Heidegger and Nietzsche**:
- From the standpoint of modernistic orthodoxy, both Nietzsche's text and Heidegger's interpretation were "treacherous"
- However, from Heidegger's own perspective, he would have been better advised to distrust both Nietzsche's text and his own interpretation of it
