### INTRODUCTION

**Theories on Thoughts and Memetics:**
* People may feel their thoughts are not entirely their own due to external influence (witchcraft beliefs as an example)
* Ideas can be transmitted from person to person, replicating themselves inside our heads (meme theory)
* Richard Dawkins proposed the term "memes" for cultural particles that replicate like biological viruses
* Memetics aims to establish the existence of memes and their implications for human psychology and society.

**Introduction:**
* Author encountered people who believe in witchcraft beliefs
* Belief in witchcraft does not make life better, creates social tension
* Similarities between cultural evolution and biological processes
* Richard Dawkins proposed memetics as a way to describe cultural evolution using the same principles as biological evolution.

**Memes as Replicators:**
* Memes are ideas that "infect" brains like mind viruses
* Memes have their own interests, conflicting with our best interests
* Memetics identifies memes as replicators in cultural evolution
* Memetics contrasts from other approaches focusing only on genetic heredity.

**The Need for a Science of Memes:**
* Memetics aims to clarify the core idea of memetics: that memes are replicators
* Replication is a more precise claim about how evolution works
* Identifying memes and their sources can help answer crucial questions in memetics.


### Chapter One IN THE MIDDLE OF A MUDDLE

**The Replicator Dynamic: Communication and Evolutionary Processes**

**Events Involving Information Transmission:**
- Kuru: A pathogen causes a disease that spreads through infection, leaving the original copy in the source
- Darwin's Idea: Information spreads from one mind to another through reading
- Michelangelo Virus: Digital information is transmitted electronically, with no change in the hacker's computer

**The Concept of Replicators:**
- A unit that can produce a copy of itself is called a replicator
- The replicator dynamic underlies all evolutionary processes
- Represents the means by which information is replicated, often requiring a catalyst

**Kuru: Causes and Controversy:**
- Gajdusek's theory: Kuru caused by a dormant virus with long-term strategic effects
- Prusiner's theory: Kuru caused by prions, a novel class of proteinaceous infectious particles that violate biological dogma
- Neither theory has been conclusively proven yet

**Implications:**
- Understanding whether a replicator is involved in an event determines its significance in the larger evolutionary lineage.


#### Exploring two perspectives on information replication: genes vs. memes (memes as information-bearing replicators)

**Prions and Disease:**
- Link between consuming brain tissue and later development of prion diseases (CJD)
- Prions don't reproduce like viruses: no genetic bottleneck, easily transferable to new hosts
- Human CJD can be contracted from eating infected beef or mother's milk

**Prions:**
- Protein particles that cause diseases through conformational change
- Infectious but not dependent on DNA for reproduction
- Can transmit between species (mad cow disease)

**Malthus and Darwin:**
- Malthus' ideas influenced Darwin's development of the theory of evolution
- Explanations:
  * Genes using novel strategy to make organisms more clever
  * Ideas as replicators (memes) that reproduce in brains

**Memes:**
- Replicators residing in people's brains, reproducing during transmission between individuals
- Survival of memes can be seen as a battle for survival within the population of brains

**Computer Viruses:**
- Can be explained from two perspectives: traditional or novel replicator (meme) viewpoint
- Traditional view: communication determined by wills of communicating parties
- Memetic perspective: information packet (virus) has own agenda, manipulates carriers for reproduction.


#### Investigating causes of information communication: Genes vs. memes and social networks

**Meme Theory: The Role of Viral Communication**

**Central Question:**
- What causal forces underlie the communication of information?
- Genetic or non-genetic replicators, who is the primary driver?

**Viral Marketing:**
- Coined by Steve Jurvetson in 1997 as self-replicating advertisements for businesses
- Effective growth through word-of-mouth marketing
- Focus on early adopters and influential individuals to spread message

**Three Types of Influential Individuals:**

**Connectors:**
- Gregarious gossipers with wide social networks
- Speed information spread between different walks of life
- Reduce likelihood of idea staying in isolated groups

**Mavens:**
- Helpful people with expert knowledge
- Introduce ideas to strategic contacts in specific areas
- See trends in their earliest phases

**Salesmen:**
- Persuasive individuals who convince others of a product's value
- Transform basic vision into digestible form for masses
- Increase "stickiness" of an idea

**Infectious Ideas:**
- Memes: elements of culture passed on by non-genetic means, such as tunes, ideas, catchphrases, fashions, pottery techniques, or architectural styles
- The term "meme" combines hints of memory, mimetic, and gene in one pithy package.


#### Memetics: Cultural Evolution through Memes as Viral Replicators with Weak Scientific Foundations.

**Meme Theory: An Overview**

**Background:**
- Memes introduced as second form of replicator independent of genetic determinism
- Resides in people's brains, reproducing during transmission between individuals
- Originates from social learning and imitation

**Characteristics:**
- Acquired through reading books or watching television
- Explanation for cultural evolution
- Popular among philosophers, psychologists, sociologists, computer scientists, and interested individuals
- Lacks formal theoretical framework in some cases
- Antipathy from academics

**History:**
- Originated as a metaphor for the spread of ideas (Meme = "mind virus")
- Adoption of epidemiological approach to study communication events
- Memes seen as parasites using human hosts' resources for transmission and survival

**Weaknesses:**
- Allows intellectual laziness in understanding complex processes
- Lack of rigor in general discourse compared to hard science standards
- Misconceptions about the nature and evolution of memes.

**Meme Transmission:**
- Reduced to activity of loquacious and gregarious people who influence product reputations (Seth Godin's "Unleashing the Ideavirus")
- Complex analysis in academic literature on social networks and idea contagion diluted with each iteration of borrowing process.

**Analogies:**
- Memes compared to viruses that parasitize human hosts for their own transmission
- Both memes and viruses undergo competition for survival.


#### The debate on the definition and nature of memes in cultural evolution: genes vs. contagion or viral metaphor.

**Epidemiology vs. Memetics: Understanding the Debate**

**Epidemiology:**
- Studies population level trends, not means of spread
- Doesn't account for changes in pathogen nature or evolution
- Focuses on rate of spread, not physical form of pathogen

**Meme Theory:**
- Memes compared to genes as cultural replicators
- Debate between "meme-as-germ" and "meme-as-gene" factions

**Problems with Meme Theory:**
- Lack of clear definition or evidence for memes' physical nature
- Overlapping arguments with gene theory
- Controversial suggestion that cultural replicators inhabit brains

**Arguments for Memetics:**
- Memes have evolutionary interests, shaping human behavior
- Cultural evolution cannot be explained solely by genes
- Memes can create copies of themselves through imitation and transmission

**Memetics vs. Standard Theories of Cultural Change:**
- No clear evidence supporting the existence of memes
- Lack of consensus on defining a meme's physical nature or how it replicates, varies, and gets transmitted.

**Meme Theory Implications:**
- Expansion of human brain and restaurant tipping phenomena explained by memes (no evidence provided)
- Controversial suggestion that cultural replicators inhabit brains alongside prions.


### Chapter Two A SPECIAL KIND OF INHERITANCE

**Cultural Evolution: A Special Kind of Inheritance**

**Background:**
- Berthold Laufer's critique of cultural evolution theory as outdated and incorrect
- Marshall Sahlins' belief in the significance of evolutionary theories in anthropology

**Human Evolution and Cultural Diversification**
- Increase in complexity and diversity of cultural forms over time
- Explanation needed for this process: memetics, genetic evolution or other mechanisms?

**Properties of Evolution:**
1. **Heredity**: Entities give rise to similar entities (A to A, B to B)
2. **Variation**: Heredity is not exact; variations occur in populations
3. **Fitness**: Variations impact survival and reproduction rates
4. Heredity doesn't require replication, but correlation between parents and offspring exists
5. Evolution by natural selection can occur even without replication
6. Replication: mechanism underlying biological heredity; genes as replicators
7. Heredity vs. evolution: heredity measures phenotypic traits (observable), evolution is about both heredity and replication
8. Importance of population size, Malthus' theory, and Darwin's addition of inheritance and variation principles
9. Variation principle: offspring may have slightly different characteristics than parents; ability to inspire copies essential for evolution
10. Replicators: DNA molecules in biological terms; heredity due to descent with modification in a lineage of replicators
11. Heredity allows sequential replacement instead of duplication, as seen in the example of degraded and replaced DNA molecules.


#### Exploring cultural evolution through replication vs heredity

**The Evolutionary Nature of Culture**

**Replication and Variation in Biology**:
- Replication of genetic material does not always result in an exact copy
- Replicated material can produce something slightly different, but still able to replicate
- This represents a "branch-point" in the lineage, with old and new forms coexisting

**Fitness, Variation, and Heredity**:
- Fitness refers to a replicator's ability to spread through a population
- Fitness is dependent on environmental conditions
- Evolution occurs when traits that confer a competitive advantage increase in frequency

**Cultural Evolution**:
- The question of whether culture replicates or just exhibits heredity
- **Possible Explanations**:
  - Cultural traits may reappear without being recreated through social transmission (like memes)
  - Cultural similarities could be due to universal genetic biases shaping learning and behavior

**The Difficulty of Defining Culture**:
- The concept of "culture" is broad, including artifacts, behaviors, and beliefs
- A clear definition is necessary to understand how culture evolves through replication


#### Exploring theories on the origins of culture: Sociobiology vs. Memetics

**Cultural Evolution: A Comparison of Theories**

**Definition of Culture**
- Predominantly seen as a cohesive set of mental representations
- Reproduced through enculturation of subsequent generations
- Emphasis on social learning and transmission

**Tension between Genetics and Cultural Transmission**
- Attempt to keep culture separate from genetics
- Long period of human childhood allows for prolonged cultural apprenticeship
- Desire to acknowledge resemblance between cultural and genetic transmission

**Sociobiology: A Modern Evolutionary Theory of Society and Culture**
- Emerged in the 1970s as a "modern" evolutionary theory
- Human behavior understood through genetically acquired learning biases and rational calculation
- Behavior is a form of phenotypic plasticity that adapts to environmental stimuli
- Fitness maximization is the decisive principle in explaining behavior

**Critique of Sociobiology**
- Doesn't acknowledge cultural transmission as an independent factor in evolution
- Genetic and environmental factors alone can explain behavioral variation
- Human sociobiologists argue that culture is a product of interaction between genes and environment.

**Implications for Memetics**
- Understanding the relationship between genetics, environment, and cultural transmission remains an open question in the study of cultural evolution.
- The tension between different theoretical approaches continues to drive research and debate within this field.


#### Exploring the origins of human behavior: Culture as an evolved trait or biological process, sociobiology and evolutionary psychology perspectives.

**Sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology**

**Background:**
- Sociobiology: explains behavior through natural selection
- Humans placed in same conceptual box as other animals
- Mind conceived as general-purpose information processor
- Focus on subsistence, resource exchange, parenting, reproductive strategies

**Sociobiological Perspective:**
- Culture reduced to evolved trait
- Behavior governed by psychological or physiological mechanisms
- People tend to make optimal choices due to evolutionary processes
- Fitness maximization in human behavior
- Studies on fitness and offspring correlation
- Focuses on foraging societies where culture is perceived as constrained

**Evolutionary Psychology:**
- Founded on evolution to give psychology a scientific paradigm
- Brain, the most complex object in the known universe, must be understood through evolution
- Default assumption in 20th century psychology was general information processor model of brain
- Experiments by John Garcia led to concept of prepared fears: fears that are learned due to species’ evolutionary history.

**Behaviorism:**
- Dominant school of thought in psychology before sociobiology
- Behavior is a response to stimuli, not explainable solely in terms of conditioned memory or stimulus-response.

**Prepared Fears:**
- Garcia's experiments revealed that rats could not learn to associate lights and buzzers with nausea as they were not part of their evolutionary history.
- Learned aversions quickly induced and persistent, even after long intervals between trials.

**Impact on Psychology:**
- Behaviorism dominated psychology until the rise of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology
- Intervening variables had to be invoked to explain results that couldn't be explained simply in terms of stimulus-response or conditioned memory.


#### Evolutionary psychology: Brain as evolved organ for processing information and solving adaptive problems through mental modules with rapid response instincts.

**Behaviorism vs. Evolutionary Psychology**

**Behaviorism**:
- Behavior is a learned response to environmental conditions
- Brains are simply trained by experience
- No need to invoke internal structure in the mind to explain behavior

**Evolutionary Psychology**:
- The brain computes, but it doesn't compute everything or with equal alacrity
- The brain is an evolved organ for processing information
- Evolutionary psychology sees the brain as a "special-purpose learner" limited in what it can learn by innate brain structures

**Selective Forces**:
- Incidental circumstances cannot be the focus of selective forces, as they never materialize again
- The attributes of the mind responsible for successful behaviors can be rewarded over time, leading to adaptations in the brain

**Evolutionary Pressures**:
- Evolutionary psychologists focus on the decisional process before behavior, which is more important for evolution's course
- The human brain consists of a set of evolved psychological mechanisms designed by natural selection to solve adaptive problems faced by our ancestors

**Human Evolutionary Niche**:
- Reconstructing the ancestral environment and selective pressures that influenced the evolution of human mental adaptations
- Evolved structure of the human mind is adapted to the life of prehistoric hunter-gatherers
- Important tasks include acquiring food, avoiding predators, gaining reproductive opportunities, parenting, and living with others

**Modular Reasoning or Learning Circuits**:
- Evolved psychological mechanisms are specialized for solving particular adaptive problems
- Modules have complex structures and are supplied with substantial innate knowledge about their proprietary domain
- These "mental instincts" develop reliably in all normal human beings without effort or formal instruction

**Automatic Processing**:
- Recognizing a familiar face involves a multistage sequence of unconscious mental events occupying nearly one-third of the cortex
- Having to "think" about seeing would add time and be maladaptive for survival responses like the flight reflex after seeing a cobra.


#### Evolutionary psychology: Universal psychological adaptations rooted in human nature

**Evolutionary Psychology**

**Overview**:
- Evolutionary psychology focuses on understanding the functions of psychological adaptations that drive human behavior
- Universal mental structure underlying unique human nature
- Discovery and description of these adaptations provide a basis for universal laws in psychology

**Universal Psychological Adaptations**:
- Result of cumulative selection over hundreds of thousands of years
- Includes modules for interpreting behavior and making flexible responses: physical causality, objects, living things, animals, humans, "theory of mind," and social contracts
- Universal psychological mechanisms generate diverse behaviors and preferences in response to circumstances

**Evolutionary vs. Sociobiology**:
- Evolutionary psychology emphasizes the role of innate mental content, while sociobiology focuses on evolved behavioral responses

**Culture and Inheritance**:
- **Evoked Culture**: Innate information expressed contingently in different environments
- **Epidemiological Culture**: Information spread through a population like a virus
- Evolutionary psychologists argue that most knowledge is innately encoded in the human genome, with individual experience serving to activate and shape it

**Jukebox Analogy**:
- Humans are born with a "jukebox" containing all potential musical styles (i.e., psychological adaptations)
- Different individuals express different adaptations based on their unique developmental and historical circumstances


#### Cultural information exceeds human brain capacity, challenging the evoked culture argument.

**Evolutionary Psychology and Cultural Transmission**

**Evolutionary Psychologists' Position**:
- Cultural traits are explained by heredity rather than information transmission
- Convergent evolution based on shared experience, not transportation of memes
- The brain is big enough to hold all the "records" required anywhere in the world

**Problems with Ignoring Information Transmission**:
- Requires a very large "jukebox" to hold all the potential cultural information
- Human genome cannot account for all recently evolved culture stored in the brain
- Ethnographic records contain much more information than can be stored in the human brain
- Evolutionary psychology's assumption of pre-stored knowledge does not account for new cultural phenomena like slang, technology, and personal preferences.


#### The debate on the role and significance of cultural transmission in human evolution.

**Cultural Variation and Evolutionary Psychology**

**Evolutionary Psychology's Perspective on Cultural Variation**:
- Evolutionary psychologists argue that cultural variation can be explained as a response to interpersonal conflict, based on principles of evolutionary psychology.
- Example: Children living with stepparents (not genetically related) are at higher risk of being killed than genetic offspring.
- Cross-cultural differences in homicide rates are significant and independent of environmental/socioeconomic variables.
- Evolutionary psychologists suggest that culture is not a straightforward response to environmental stimuli, as cultural ecology theories proposed.

**Limitations of Evolutionary Psychology's Explanation**:
- Evolutionary psychology cannot fully explain intracultural or intercultural variation in cultural practices.
- Other factors like historical inertia and "national character" play a role in shaping cultural differences.

**Transmission of Cultural Information**:
- Sociobiologists/evolutionary psychologists argue that culture is merely a superficial veneer with little impact on biological evolution.
- Cultural anthropologists argue that culture is an integral part of human existence, determining how we interpret experiences and access resources.

**Cultural Transmission Process**:
- Cultural transmission occurs through social learning, not just individual innovation or random factors.
- Novel practices/ideas spread through a population in a "S-shaped" adoption curve, with slow initial growth followed by saturation and decline.


#### The role of cultural transmission in the spread of novelties and social influence.

**Cultural Transmission: S-Shaped Diffusion Patterns**
* **S-shaped patterns**: not explained by individual trial-and-error experience or rational adoption alone
* **Conformist transmission**: psychological bias toward adopting traits exhibited by prestigious individuals or social group
* **Importance of social transmission**: not to be dismissed as trivial, influences beliefs and values

**Approaches to Understanding Cultural Transmission**
* **Mathematical communication theory**: developed at Bell telephone labs
* **Cybernetics**: brainchild of Norbert Wiener
* **Epidemiology**: study of how pathogens disperse through populations, applicable to cultural evolution

**Informational Epidemiology**
* Explains distribution of beliefs in a population as cumulative result of diffusion events
* Cultural trait seen as a virus: weaker analogy than genetic evolution

**Cultural Selectionism**
* Focuses on what qualities cultural beliefs must exhibit to succeed and propagate
* Adapts population genetic models to cultural transmission
* Emphasizes **units of selection**: entities that undergo multiplication and heredity (replicators)
* Distinguishes from earlier applications of evolutionary theory to social phenomena, which viewed all change as progress
* Culture defined as information acquired from others through teaching or imitation at the population level.


#### Culture as a form of evolution through selection and social transmission of ideas

**Cultural Evolution: A Darwinian Perspective**

**Variation in Cultural Knowledge**
- Transmission is never perfect, leading to variation between individuals
- Culture distributed across individuals due to limited mental capacity
- Basis for selection processes (physical to psychological)
- Cultural evolution analyzed using Darwinian methods

**Gene-Culture Coevolutionary Modeling**
- Emphasizes traditions of information learned through social transmission
- Accounts for unique features of cultural inheritance
- Examples: multiple parentage, transmission within peer groups

**Cultural Inheritance and Evolution Theory**
- Ideas are the "replicator" of culture, behavior is its expression (phenotype)
- Mental planning as an intermediate step between idea and manifestation
- Variation introduced through errors in transmission

**Population Thinking in Cultural Selectionism**
- Focus on population level information propagated forward through time
- Agnostic about the underlying process, allowing use of multiple models

**Cultural Selection: A Darwinian Process**
- Selective forces: psychological biases leading to preference for certain traits
- Increase or decrease in frequency due to adoption by individuals
- Natural selection can also act on cultural variation through hosts' behavior and survival/fertility.

**Independence of Cultural and Genetic Inheritance**
- If cultural inheritance is independent, it can be modeled separately from genetic inheritance.


#### Cultural evolution: Genes and social learning interact for trait transmission

**Models of Cultural Trait Transmission**

**Cultural Evolution Through Cycles:**
- Changes in frequency of cultural traits occur through cycles of social interaction and differential social transmission (cultural selection)

**Interaction Between Genetic and Cultural Inheritance:**
- In some situations, individual's propensity to adopt a cultural trait depends on their genetic makeup
- Interaction can be modeled as a parameter determining the probability of acquiring a trait based on genes
- Example: Evolution of lactose intolerance and milk consumption

**Learning as a Means for Cultural Change:**
- Learning allows individuals to acquire information about local conditions, adjusting behavior faster than genetic changes
- Social learning has advantages in terms of cost and accuracy
- Helps avoid engaging in behaviors that run counter to one's interests
- Selectionist models indicate that social learning is more efficient when environmental conditions change rapidly or if individuals migrate to different niches

**Cultural Evolution and Psychological Biases:**
- Universal psychological biases produce variability in cultural traits not directly tied to ecological differences
- Barriers to transmission can form, creating distinct cultural groups (e.g., ethnicities)

**Differences Between Genetic and Cultural Transmission:**
- Cultural evolution is embedded in and constrained by genetically evolved psychological propensities
- Biases can lead to disparate cultural equilibria over time due to dynamics internal to the cultural realm
- Cultural selectionism holds that differing transmission systems introduce important changes in evolutionary dynamics (e.g., information flow in opposite directions)


#### Cultural evolution: Genes vs. memes and heritability vs. replication

**Cultural Selectionism vs. Memetics: Two Approaches to Understanding Culture**

**Differences Between Cultural Evolution and Genetic Evolution:**
- Cultural evolution can produce more rapid change than genetic evolution
- Cultural practices can persist even in the face of natural selection against individuals engaging in them
- Differences in inheritance systems account for these dynamic properties

**Origins of Cultural Inheritance:**
- Biological theory explains cultural inheritance through natural selection acting on genes
- Cultural evolution cannot be reduced to biological fitness maximization by natural selection directly on genes

**Mechanisms of Cultural Transmission:**
- Traits with high cultural fitness can increase in frequency despite being maladaptive genetically
- Cultural traits may influence the fitness of genes, or genes may determine which direction cultural traits will move
- Genes and cultural traits can each go their own way independently

**Cultural Selectionism vs. Memetics:**
- Both approaches acknowledge the central role of transmitted information in culture
- Differences lie in how they explain the reproduction of cultural information
- Cultural selectionism requires only heredity, while memetics require replication
- Memetics has been criticized for failing to provide a reasonable theory of meme replication

**Implications:**
- Understanding the mechanisms behind culture requires addressing both genetic and cultural factors
- Memetics and cultural selectionism offer distinct perspectives on how cultural information is transmitted and evolves over time.


#### Memetics: Memes vs. Genes and their influence on behavior and adaptation.

**Memetics: Controversies and Misconceptions**
* **Susan Blackmore's The Meme Machine**: Presumes existence of memes; focuses on selection among them
* Question: Which memes are more likely to find a safe home and get passed on?
* Dan Dennett's perspective: Memes can benefit in cultural trait contests (Darwin's Dangerous Idea)
* "Who benefits?" question applied to memes versus genes controversy
* Ant and the "brainworm" fluke example: Parasitic fluke infects ant's brain, making it perform counterproductive behavior
* Not the same situation as genes competing among themselves
* Different stakes for memes and genes in rivalries
* Meme depends on behaviors like social communication for transmission
* Genes want to keep their host alive, not concerned about gossiping behavior
* Memes invest more energy in ensuring they win "to gossiper or not to gossip" fight
* Outcome of a conflict does not necessarily indicate who the adaptation is evolved for
* Maladaptation can be due to memes (parasitic replicators) but also genes or their conflicting interests.

**Parasitism and Symbiosis**:
* Parasites don't necessarily manifest themselves through maladaptations
* Cultural parasites such as memetic ideas need not cause maladaptations
* Some maladaptive behaviors may result from conflicts between genes or a gene's expectations and the creature's current conditions.

**Misconceptions about Memes**:
* Dennett's perspective is too narrow: Maladaptations don't always indicate meme activity
* Not all maladaptive behaviors are caused by memes; some may result from conflicts within genes or between genes and organism conditions.


### Chapter Three ADDING ROOMS TO DARWINS HOUSE

**Expanding the Living Room: Darwin's House of Evolutionary Theory**

**Darwin's Achievements**:
- Charles Darwin lived at Down House for 40 years, writing works that made him famous
- His house is a national treasure and has been recently restored
- Darwin's wife Emma Wedgwood bore him 10 children, making daily life cramped

**Expansion of Darwin's Intellectual Property**:
- Theoretical carpenters have added "rooms" to Darwin's scholarly mansion
- New wings have been added for evolutionary approaches to chemistry, economics, and computer science
- An entire "upstairs" has sprung up in the form of Darwinian humanities
- Cosmologists have found inspiration in Darwinian thinking, leading to theories of multiple universes competing for survival

**Darwinism and Memes**:
- Need to ensure that Darwinian principles apply beyond just genes (memes)
- History of evolutionary theory:
  - Mendel's work on inheritance of visible traits
  - Galton's statistical work showed genetic inheritance of small variances in traits
  - Reconciliation of Mendelism and quantitative genetics through multiple genes

**Neo-Darwinian Synthesis**:
- Unification of evolutionary theory to include both qualitative and quantitative characters
- Formed the cornerstone of contemporary evolutionary theory for last 50 years

**Punctuated Equilibrium**:
- Idea that evolution proceeds in bursts, with long periods of stagnation
- Widely touted by creationists to challenge Darwinism
- Gould affirmed his allegiance to Darwin's ideas

**Evolutionary Theory Beyond Natural Selection**:
- Stuart Kaufmann's work on complex structures arising from physical and chemical constraints
- Many aspects of organism's form don't have to be coded for by genes, but arise through self-organization


#### Exploring Evolution: Altruism, Genes, and Hamilton's Insight

**Natural Selection and Evolutionary Change**

**Natural Selection**:
- Primary determinant of direction lineages organisms take over time
- Even if not solely responsible for organism form, it is still the most important biological agent
- Darwin's theory emphasizes that "if any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory"

**Altruism and Social Insects**:
- Challenge to Darwin's theory: how do sterile worker insects that forgo reproduction to assist the queen contribute genetically?
- Hamilton's insight: related animals share many genes, and genes can evolve ways to help each other out, benefiting in terms of representation in next generation
- "Hamilton's rule": if individual profits from altruistic act shares higher proportion of genes with the benefactor than the cost-benefit ratio, genes behind such altruism can evolve

**Expansion of Darwinian Theory**:
- Sociobiology: a generalization of Darwinism to encompass social life phenomena
- Hamilton's gene's-eye view: natural selection favors mutual assistance between related genes, regardless of location
- Recognition that genes exist in multiple copies within populations and should evolve to collaborate

**Darwinian Universe**:
- Darwinian theory has been applied to various fields, including evolutionary ecology, psychology, economics, and more
- Justification for calling these theories "Darwinian":
  - Theory of evolution by natural selection as driving force behind directional change in evolution
  - Recognition of relationship between various influences on genetic change (Neo-Darwinian Synthesis)
- Limitations: does not adequately cover changes in gene frequencies by other means and does not provide a framework for identifying organisms


#### Universal Darwinism: Replicators and Evolution's Functional Components

**Evolutionary Theory Beyond Organisms: Universal Darwinism**

**Organisms vs. Replicators as Fundamental Units of Evolution**
- Darwin's theory focused on organisms, but questions arise about its application to culture and other non-organic systems
- Genes are limited in providing a foundation for understanding cultural evolution
- Universal Darwinism: recognizes two functions - replication and selective interaction

**Replicators as Basic Units of Evolutionary Processes**
- Replicators are information units that can pass on their structure through copying
- Examples include Mendelian genes, computer viruses, memes, etc.
- Replication is the central phenomenon underlying any evolutionary process

**Defining Replication**
- Causation: The source must be causally involved in the production of the copy
- Similarity: The copy must be like its source in relevant respects
- Information transfer: The process that generates the copy must obtain information from the same source
- Duplication: One entity gives rise to two or more replicators

**Replicator vs. Source: Minimal Conditions for Replication**
- Causation: Replicator participates in the process that results in its copy
- Control over replication process is neutral, but the replicator must be responsible for making it happen


#### Exploring the concept of replication: DNA as an example and other examples falling short.

**Replication Criteria:**
1. **Information Transfer**: Replicators must transfer information from one generation to the next without external intervention.
2. **Similarity**: Source and copy must belong to the same class of entities and have relevant respects in terms of qualities that maintain generative ability and produce similarity.
3. **Local Process**: The process of replication is encapsulated within the replicator itself, without any external instructions or influences.
4. **Duplication**: Replicators multiply by increasing their number, changing the relative frequency of types in a population.

**Examples:**
- **Queen's Stamp**: Though it fulfills some criteria, lacks lineage and proximate cause to qualify as replication.
- **Office Paper with Sales Graph**: Fulfills all criteria but requires human intervention, making the paper itself not a replicator.

**Implications:**
- Replication is based on causal linkages and lineage rather than just similarity.
- Proximate cause plays an important role in understanding true instances of replication.


#### Evolution and replication: Replicators, interactors, and lineages in genetics

**Replicators and Interactors in Evolutionary Process**

**Replicators:**
- Templates for relevant information (causation)
- Similarity between original and copy (if the copier is good)
- Information derived from originals (inheritance relationship fulfilled)
- Both original and copy are inspected side by side (duplication)
- Can be further reproduced, creating a lineage
- Mutations may lead to evolutionary changes (selection)
- Not limited to biological entities
- Power: exerts positive influence on probability of replication
- Determines which replicators "win" in reproduction process
- Produce interactors (vehicles or protected environments for replication)

**Interactors:**
- Temporary storehouses for aggregated genes
- Distinguished from replicators by inability to pass on structure directly
- Multiply collective capabilities of genes and obey their will (reproduction)
- Interact with environment, fostering or causing demise of replicators they house
- Selected based on what they do (interactions with environment)
- Cannot form lineages like replicators

**Evolution as a Process:**
- Replication sequence leads to chains of similar events (lineage)
- Each instance related by the fact that a replicator of the same type produced it
- Descent: recurring features reproduced from scratch each time they appear.


#### Universal Darwinism: Replicators, Interactors, and Evolutionary Theory's Levels of Individuality

**Lineages and Evolution: Replicators and Interactors**

**Replication as Foundation of Evolution:**
- Lineages: continuous sequences linking replicators past to future
- Replicators: agents responsible for evolution through differential survival
- Heredity + Variation + Fitness identify individuals capable of evolving

**Dawkins' Universal Darwinism vs. Lewontin's Approach:**
- Dawkins: replication as foundation, limited reach
- Lewontin: heredity as necessary condition, levels abstraction

**Levels Abstraction in Evolutionary Theory:**
- Identify individuals at various levels of organization
- Individuals defined by essential properties for evolution
- Organisms are more tightly organized than groups or species

**Replication vs. Inheritance in Memetics:**
- Memetics: replicator called the meme is central to cultural evolution
- Difference between memetics and other schools of thought on culture lies in replication versus inheritance focus.


#### Replication theory: understanding self-replicating systems and memes through energy, catalysts, and reaction types.

**Memetics and Replication Theory**
* Memetics is the area of research focusing on memes as cultural replicators
* Unique claim: memes fulfill criteria of a cultural replicator (causation, similarity, information transfer, duplication)
* Replicator theory from Vienna School offers insights into nature of replication and memes
	+ General theory of evolutionary process
	+ Applicable to all phenomena involving self-reproduction
* Replication involves energy input for duplication principle to occur
* Catalysts required when replicators lack energy or ability to manage energy during reaction
* Replicators require resources and concentration in a container to avoid interference
* Replication reactions begin with enzyme and substrate, forming temporary complex whole, then dissociating into products
* Autocatalysis: replicator serves as its own catalyst, self-replication (single step, first-order replicator equation)
	+ Malthusian growth process: births linear function of density; constant per-capita birth rate
	+ Survival of the fittest: faster growing replicator dominates microenvironment


#### Evolutionary dynamics: Replication processes and survival regimes, from autocatalytic to survival of the first.

**Replicator Dynamics: Beyond Darwin's Optimizing Process**

**Replication Processes**:
- Replicators that use templates for duplication tend to follow a pattern of growth similar to DNA replication
- Autocatalytic replication: each replicator serves as its own template, leading to exponential population growth
- Second-order replicated equation: replicators require an independent catalyst and resources to reproduce, with faster growth dependent on availability of the catalyst

**Evolutionary Dynamics**:
- **Survival of the First**: replicator with highest initial concentration wins the race, regardless of its fitness
- This regime is a "winner-take-all" situation where the first to finish dominates the population
- Examples: protein-catalyzed replication, sexual reproduction

**Hypercycles**:
- Mutualistic group of molecules that catalyze one another in a circular fashion
- Replication is relatively slow due to requiring all members to be present
- Fastest cycle outcompetes others, especially if they use the same resources
- Larger cycles are at a disadvantage due to higher mutation risk and resource requirements.


#### Different replicator growth rates lead to distinct evolutionary dynamics.

**Evolutionary Regimes and Replicator Growth Rates**

**Overview:**
- Three distinct evolutionary regimes based on replicator growth rates: survival of the fittest, survival of everybody, and survival of the first.
- The type of mechanism used for replication determines its speed and resulting evolutionary dynamics.

**Survival of the Fittest (Exponential Growth):**
- Each replicator produces one copy of itself each time around
- No intrinsic advantage over time
- Replicators compete on equal terms based on their own characteristics

**Survival of Everybody (Sub-exponential Growth):**
- One replicator can produce multiple copies, but resources are exhausted
- All replicators have a chance to survive and increase in frequency
- No optimization of biological fitness over time

**Survival of the First (Super-exponential Growth):**
- Replicators produce more than one copy at a time
- Fastest replicator wins by sheer numbers
- Adaptations do not necessarily accumulate over time

**Replication Mechanisms:**
- Different mechanisms result in distinct rates of increase over time
- Growth rate depends on concentration of existing replicators, availability of resources, and whether the replicator or an assistant serves as catalyst.

**First-Order Replicators:**
- Can produce qualitatively different evolutionary dynamics within the class
- Variation in growth rates determined by reaction kinetics (intermediate combinations of elements)

**Importance of Mechanistic Understanding:**
- Abstract models are not enough to understand evolution at a given level of organization.
- Replicators use different mechanisms for replication, which affects outcomes and selection dynamics.


### Chapter Four THE REPLICATOR ZOO

**The Replicator Zoo: Prions as Alternative Biological Replicators**

**Background:**
- Charles Darwin's observation of parallelism in organic life forms and fossils
- Discovery of prions: a new class of replicators independent of genes, challenging Crick's central dogma of biology

**Prions as Replicators:**
1. Discovered in 1957, but only recently understood
2. Cause infectious diseases through protein particles transmission
3. No DNA or RNA involved in replication
4. Catalyst-induced conformational change leads to self-replication
5. First instance of different mode of replication from genes within biological realm
6. Exciting development for biology, generating scientific interest and controversy

**Protein Structure:**
1. Made up of amino acids arranged in chains
2. Form unique three-dimensional structures (native state)
3. Shape determines function
4. Difficult to predict from sequence alone
5. Protein folding governed by electrochemical bonds
6. IBM's efforts to model protein folding using a petaflop machine
7. Recent success in modeling through focusing on coarse-grained features and fundamental physical laws
8. Molecular chains explore a smaller range of shapes than theoretically available due to topology determination.


#### Proteins: Prions and their role in unusual diseases and evolution

**Protein Folding: Predicting Protein Structures and Mechanisms**
- **Modeling protein folding**: based on simplified representations of polypeptide chain for small proteins
- New methods focus on the end-state of process - protein's overall shape
- Misfolding can lead to prions, which can cause diseases like TSEs (scrapie in sheep and goats, BSE or "mad cow" disease, CJD in humans)

**Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs)**
- Characterized by accumulation of a specific form of prion protein in the central nervous system
- Normally folded proteins can be influenced to adopt an infectious prion state, leading to plaque formation and neuronal damage
- Prions replicate themselves through this process without nucleic acid involvement
- Different strains of prions exist, each with unique shapes that transmit disease upon contact with normal protein molecules

**Prion Replication and Transmission**
- Influence of infectious prion on normal proteins causes refolding into infectious prions
- Prions can cross species boundaries, leading to new variant CJD (mad cow disease in humans)
- Carriers of prions may transmit them to others of the same or different species

**Prions as New Forms of Replicators**
- Prions are not the primary agents of biological heredity but could be widespread explanations for diseases
- Originally found only in vertebrates, now found in other classes of proteins across various organisms
- Older prions do not cause disease or significantly disrupt normal functions; newer ones can lead to disease in mammals.


#### Prions as replicators: unique characteristics and evolutionary implications for memes.

**Prions: Replicators and Molecular Chaperones**

**Properties of Prions:**
- Act as molecular chaperones, catalyzing protein conversion into prion form
- Interaction with chaperone (protein X) triggers replication process
- Can lead to accumulation of prions in the brain

**Prion Replication:**
- Linear increase in number when one prion is present
- Selection regime: only fittest survive
- Independent of genes, but DNA codes for protein molecules
- Limited replicators with few strains
- Modular: transferable domains can attach to various proteins

**Characteristics of Prions:**
- Reversible: switch between normal and infectious forms
- Arise through various means: genetic predilection, spontaneous mutation, contact, interpersonal transmission
- Impact on species evolution: potential effect on epigenetic inheritance

**Computers and Security:**
- Computers exhibit both machine and intelligent properties
- Confusing nature of computers in terms of security.


#### Computer viruses: replication in digital systems and implications for physical substrates.

**Computer Viruses: Understanding Replication Processes**

**Background:**
- Humans tend to treat computers as living beings due to their integration into society
- Confusion between symbols (programs) and binary states in electrical circuits (code)
- Computer viruses are programs that reproduce by attaching themselves to other executable files

**Definition of a Comp-Virus:**
- Sequence of symbols in machine memory causing another sequence to appear elsewhere
- Modifies other programs to include its code for further replication
- Can be classified as: shell, intrusive, or add-on viruses based on attachment methods

**Components of a Comp-Virus:**
1. **Search Routine**: locates new, uninfected hosts for replication
   - Determines virus reproduction speed
   - Trade-off between size and functionality
2. **Copy Routine**: copies the virus into the area identified by the search routine

**Interest in Comp-Viruses:**
- Practical: stopping next epidemic from bringing down computer networks
- Similarities with memes in replication processes and stages of evolution.


#### Computer Viruses: Replication, Triggers, and Optional Damage Functionality

**Computer Viruses: Replication and Triggering**

**Virus Replication**:
- Virus must replicate during this stage of the life cycle
- The more complex the virus, the larger the copy routine needed
- EXE files are more complex, requiring a larger copy routine

**Triggering Conditions**:
- Viruses may infect at different times:
  - Each time a program is executed
  - When specific triggering conditions occur (e.g., date/time, keystrokes, file presence)

**Virus Residence and Triggering**:
- If the virus is resident in memory, it can wait for a diskette access or program execution before infecting
- Triggering conditions are often rare, so viruses may remain undetected

**Additional Virus Functions**:
- Viruses may include routines to avoid detection:
  - Co-opt the system (stealth)
  - Execute destructive or prank code (attack phase)
- These additional functions are often detrimental to the virus's survival

**Comparing Computer and Biological Viruses**:
- **Computer viruses**: Gain control of a computer, make a copy of themselves
- **Biological viruses**: Necessarily produce destructive effects due to their physical structure

**Primary vs. Secondary Phenotypic Effects**:
- Primary phenotype: Replication function (length, trigger, location in memory)
- Secondary phenotype: Damaging or prank code added by programmers
- This division is only possible due to the super-molecular scale of computer viruses


#### Computer viruses: Classification, theory, and memory storage in electronic signals.

**Computer Viruses: Replicator Theory and Classification**

**Background:**
- John von Neumann's architecture for computers (1950s)
- Division between data processing unit (CPU) and memory
- Data held temporarily in RAM or permanently in ROM

**How Computers Process Information:**
- Signals establish electrical charge in computer registers
- Computation relies on electrons moving through circuits
- Machines register information as absence/presence of electric charge
- Binary code: 1 (on) and 0 (off), represented by electronic pulses

**Creating Software for Computers:**
- Programmers use source code in human language
- Compiler turns source code into object code
- Translator converts object code to machine code (binary)

**Computer Viruses:**
- Written as electrical or magnetic charge states in physical registers
- Can be written in higher-level languages like Pascal, C, Lisp, or directly in machine code for precise control over functions.

**Replicator Theory and Classification:**
- Replicator theory provides a rationale for classifying comp-viruses
- Classifications based on various traits: type of file infected, operation method, etc.
- Need to establish a clear principle to eliminate chaos in classification systems.


#### Classifying computer viruses by substrate and replication methods: short-term vs. long-term memory and Phase I, II, III distinctions.

**Replicator Theory Classification of Computer Viruses**

**Criteria for Classifying Replicators:**
- Based on substrate type: RAM vs. Disk (short-term vs. long-term memory)
- Distinction between magnetic and optical long-term comp-viruses is not very important due to similarities in functioning
- Three potential substrates for computer viruses: electronic short-term memory (RAM), magnetic, and optical long-term memory

**Types of Copy Mechanisms:**
- Replication reaction defines the replicator type after substrate consideration
- Basic cycle moves from long-term to short-term memory and back again
- Differences in viral life cycles come from various search and copy routines

**Phases of Computervirus Development:**

**Phase I (1960s):**
- Simple RAM-based viruses confined to a single computer
- One-way trip from disk to RAM, where they replicate and then die
- Distinction between software program, virtual operating environment, and small programs in RAM

**Phase II (Early 1980s):**
- Infection of new computers through intermediary hosts (floppy disks)
- Replication of source program itself, residing on long-term memory devices
- Two complications: spreading between computers and executable programs in RAM

**Phase III (Late 1980s):**
- Networked computers linked through electrical connections
- Broadened search for potential hosts to include any connected computer
- Reproduction cycle moves from one disk's long-term storage to another computer's long-term memory through its RAM
- Use of specialized signals for transmitting information over an electronic network.


#### Comp-viruses in artificial life: Self-replicating digital organisms and evolutionary ecosystems.

**Comp-viruses and Artificial Life (ALife)**

**Characteristics of Comp-viruses**:
- Not intrinsically destructive
- Don't append themselves to preexisting files
- Duplicate themselves elsewhere in memory

**Benefits of Recognizing Comp-viruses as Replicators**:
- Removes the belief that there is no "good" comp-virus
- Comp-viruses can be used for beneficial purposes, like curing sick computers
- Potential for scientific and technological advancements in ALife research

**TIERRA: An Artificial Life Experiment**:
- Programmed by Thomas Ray as a realplace (virtual environment) in RAM
- Inhabited by self-replicating comp-viruses competing for resources
- Mutations introduced through random flips of instructions during replication
- Viruses eliminated if they become "decrapit" or unable to further replicate

**Comp-Viruses as Replicators and Interactors**:
- Replication involves the virtual operating system executing virus instructions in memory
- Viruses have no protection layer between code and The Reaper
- Some viruses evolved to be parasites, borrowing replication code from more complex viruses
- Ongoing evolutionary arms race between host and parasite comp-viruses

**Continued Evolution of Comp-Viruses**:
- New types of self-contained, fully functional programs emerged (22 bytes long)
- Further tinkering with initial conditions produced additional biologically analogous processes


#### Artificial life: Viruses as digital replicators in computer simulations.

**TIERRA: A Binary Environment for Evolution**

**Ray's Experiment**:
- Ray designed TIERRA to simulate evolution in a binary environment
- Allowed selection of longer or shorter replicators and emergence of cooperation, cheating, and sexual reproduction
- Demonstrated that evolution occurred through natural selection, mutation, and reproduction without the need for new code

**Replication in TIERRA**:
- Replication of binary sequences (memory states) occurs in RAM during TIERRA runs
- Viruses exhibit four characteristics that identify true replicators:
  - Causation: Instruction read from one address causes system to write data to next address
  - Similarity: Both addresses have same instruction (MOV)
  - Information transfer: Operating system installs "move" command in second register by referring back to first address
  - Duplication: Two MOV instructions where previously there was one

**Imp Program as a Replicator**:
- Imp is a single instruction ("MOV $0 $1") that causes it to be copied into next location during execution
- Copying is the attack stage of Imp's life cycle, which can overwrite enemy programs and turn them into Imp
- Satisfies all four replication criteria: causation, similarity, information transfer, duplication

**Digital Evolution in TIERRA**:
- Short viruses reproduce more rapidly than long ones, leading to selection for shorter genomes
- Quarantined environment cut off from the rest of the computer by self-referential code
- Virus code is data that serves as instructions for the operating system, enabling replication within the TIERRA environment.


#### Computer viruses: evolution from floppy disks to networked systems. Early forms and spread.

**Artificial Life and Computer Viruses**

**Computer Simulations**:
- Limitations of computer simulations within "holodeck" environment on Star Trek
- Dependency on specific niche for survival and replication

**Biological vs. Digital Analogues**:
- Digital analogs to DNA/RNA-based viruses exist
- Evolutionary processes are "universal" in replicators of all types

**From Floppy to Hard Drives**:
- Computer-borne viruses began escaping confines of original host
- Virus spread escalated rapidly, with 50,000+ viruses in the wild by 2000
- Predicted to reach nearly 500,000 viruses by 2010

**Early Virus Experiments**:
- Fred Cohen's research on network security and virus spread
- Controlled experiments showed rapid virus spread within computer networks

**Boot Sector Viruses**:
- First widely circulated virus type
- Infects boot sector of floppy diskette, replicates when accessed

**File Viruses**:
- Attach to executable files and activate behind user's knowledge
- Spread widely in late 1980s, causing system downtime and denial of service

**Pendulum Swing between Virus Types**:
- File viruses more common in late 1980s due to more ways to infect files
- Boot sector viruses regained dominance by mid-1990s as Windows became prevalent

**Virus Prevalence**:
- Considered urban myths, with slow rise in prevalence and low equilibrium level
- Well-prepared organizations experienced 4 incidents per year for every 1,000 PCs


#### The evolution of computer viruses in the digital age: from disks to networks.

**The Evolution of Computer Viruses: From Disks to Networks**

**Background:**
- Rapid growth in computer use since the 1990s
- Shift from local area networks (LAN) to wide area networks (WAN), including the Internet and World Wide Web
- Standardization around TCP/IP protocol for information communication
- Development of hypertext and browsers enabling easy access to linked computers

**The Rise of Network Viruses:**
- First network virus: Melissa (1995) - spread via email attachments, infected 20% of Internet users at the time
- Introduction of WordBasic language simplified virus creation (1995)
- Love Bug virus (May 3, 2000) - first to spread through the Internet, caused billions of dollars in damage

**Types of Computer Viruses:**
- File viruses: initially dominant, spread as attachments on emails
- Macro file viruses: became most prevalent with the widespread use of Microsoft software and networking (75% of all viruses by end of century)
- Other types: personal digital assistants, mobile phones

**Impact of Virus Writers:**
- Widespread accessibility to virus writing tools
- Virtual communities of virus writers sharing code through chat groups
- Tutorials on virus creation available online

**Future Developments:**
- Continued evolution of viruses targeting new technologies (PDAs, mobile phones)
- Increasing complexity and multipronged attacks (Nimda worm)

**Computers as Organisms:**
- Computers compared to organisms in terms of structure and function
- Ability for computers to evolve with time through new files and complex structures


#### Computer viruses: Coevolution, ecology, and intentional mutation.

**Computer Viruses: Coevolution and Ecology**

**Host Organs and Parasites**:
- New types of computer "host organs" (e.g., functions like word processing) lead to the evolution of parasitic "viruses" that specialize in infecting those organs
- Viruses coevolve with their host "species" (computer systems), adapting to new software and hardware
- Viruses can also interact and conflict with each other, affecting their virulence

**Host Species and Operating Systems**:
- Each computer "species" (e.g., PC, Macintosh) has its own operating system, which viruses must adapt to
- This limits the ability of viruses to replicate across different computer species

**Ecosystems and Networks**:
- A network of computers can be seen as a "social group" with shared communication protocols and "customs" for information exchange
- The Internet is an "ecosystem of silicon-based organisms," with multiple computer species communicating through common protocols

**Evolution of Computer Viruses**:
- Most viruses are linked to the dominant computer species (IBM PCs, Microsoft software)
- Mutations in viruses are intentional, requiring human intervention to reprogram and redistribute them
- This limits the ability of viruses to evolve through natural variation like biological organisms
- Viruses must be "clever" to survive in a rapidly changing environment with frequent changes in operating systems and host species

**Replication Dynamics**:
- The replication of computer viruses involves multiple independent events (e.g., sending infected emails)
- This can lead to effective reproduction rates much higher than 1-to-1, but the actual spread is limited by filters on successful infection


#### Computer viruses: Replication and transmission through RAM, hard disks, and networks.

**Computer Viruses: Evolution and Replication Processes**

**Characteristics of Comp-viruses:**
- Only one memory cell operated on at a time in ALife case
- No parallel processing in von Neumann computers
- Operating system plods from one register to the next
- Linear rate of growth due to self-replication
- Similarities with DNA and prions

**Replication Process:**
1. Instructions go through RAM for execution
2. Some calls require accessing hard disk or ROM
3. RAM serves as enclosed domain for replication reaction
4. Dependence on external resources varies among viruses
5. Replication occurs in phases: I, II, III

**Phase I:**
- Infection localized to the RAM disk within individual computers
- Short-term and restricted to specific computers
- Replication reactions almost entirely restricted to RAM

**Phase II:**
- Spread dependent on instructions remaining resident in RAM
- Programs infect other information passing through RAM
- Copied to hard media for transmission via "sneaker net"
- Role reversal: program in long-term memory becomes replicator, data structures in RAM are the catalysts

**Phase III:**
- Electronic replication of network comp-viruses
- Vastly increased rate of spread leading to epidemics
- New reality of epidemics resulting from electronic transmission
- Need for anti-viral software and counteroffensive measures among virus writers.


#### Computer viruses as replicators: Electronic memes and signal mediated replication.

**Comp-Viruses and Replicator Theory**
* **Replication Process**: Comp-viruses replicate by converting existing memory states to produce copies of themselves.
* Similarities to Prions: Both rely on the existence of specific conditions, have a co-opting strategy, and can create copies of themselves in various forms (magnetic or optical memory).
* Robustness of Replication: Comp-viruses are more robust than prions due to their ability to evolve and compute any result that a universal computing machine can. However, their evolutionary potential is limited by human imagination.
* Mediated Information Transfer: In comp-viral replication, signals generated by the replicator can serve as message mediators, which loosens the bonds to individual substrates.
* Implications for Evolution: This flexibility raises questions about what factors contribute to the replicator's adaptability - super-molecular nature, digital coding, or signal mediation?
* Phase I and II Comp-Viruses: Do not exhibit this feature, suggesting it is a new development in Phase III viral lifecycles.


### Chapter Five THE DATA ON INFORMATION

**The Nature of Information**

**Information as an Abstraction**:
- Information is often seen as an abstraction
- Pinker's "free gift paradox" - information can be passed without loss
- Information is not a physical thing, but rather an abstract concept

**Replicators and Information**:
- Replicators like genes are not material objects
- The physical gene (DNA) is not what is conserved and passed on
- The information embodied in the nucleotide sequence is what gets transmitted
- Replicators exist on different substrates, using different codes

**Plato's Realm of Forms**:
- Platonic philosophy sees ideas as existing in an abstract heaven (the realm of Forms)
- Replicators belong to the domain of Forms, while interactors are in the material world
- This leads to a dualism between the mind and brain

**Information and Computation**:
- Information is not tied to a physical substrate
- Computers can manipulate weightless information
- As computers become smaller, they approach physical constraints

**Conclusion**:
- Johnson's argument that information is separate from matter is mistaken
- The fundamental units of information are becoming entangled with their physical substrates


#### Information is physical: The connection between matter, energy, and information in physics

**The Physical Nature of Information**

**Information as a Physical Quantity**:
- Information is not immaterial, but is a physical measure associated with matter and energy
- Information can change the course of events, making it a physical entity

**Landauer's Principle**:
- Processing information requires energy to rearrange material bits
- Erasing information incurs an energetic cost (the "thermodynamic cost of forgetting")
- This cost arises from the physical limitation that information must be erased to make way for new computations

**Reversible Computing**:
- Traditional computers erase data as part of computation, leading to energy consumption
- Reversible computing can circumvent this by reusing data and its energies instead of discarding them

**Quantum Information Obeying Unconventional Laws**:
- Quantum mechanics can allow for "quantum teleportation" - transporting information across large distances without traversing the intervening space


#### Quantum teleportation: instantaneous transfer of quantum states without physical medium using entangled particles and classical communication.

**Quantum Communication: Teleportation of Information**

**Background:**
- IBM's Charles Bennett suggested a way to achieve quantum teleportation
- Demonstrated by transporting a quantum state of light from one side of a lab table to another without physical medium between them

**Principles:**
1. **Entanglement**: Two particles become entangled when brought into contact and separated
2. **Non-locality**: Entangled particles can have effects on each other despite being distant
3. **Quantum mechanics**: Altering one particle affects the other without any material link between them
4. **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: Observation disrupts a system's state
5. **Communication process:**
  - Alice and Bob receive entangled particles, each holding one of the pair
  - Alice brings her message particle near her entangled particle for measurement (destroying its state)
  - Measurement yields information about the correlation between particles (binary answers)
  - Classical communication channel used to send one answer to Bob
  - Bob performs transformation on his entangled particle based on information from Alice, retrieving original message's quantum state.

**Implications:**
- Perfect communication with no information loss possible in theory using quantum methods
- No interaction with the world during transmission leads to minimal disruption of message
- Shannon's theory of information not universal as it applies only to cases where transmission goes through space.

**Challenges:**
- True teleportation not achievable due to physical barriers in instantaneously transmitting all relevant information about an object.


#### Understanding biological information as distinct from physical structure in evolution

**Biological Information vs. Physical Information**

**Introduction:**
- Information can be transported or transmitted using physical structures
- Biological information is not equivalent to physical information

**Physical Structure vs. Biological Information**:
- DNA molecule serves as an example of a physical structure that exhibits both structure and biological information
  - Redundancy, closure, built-in error correction, etc., are physical properties but not biological information
  - Sequence of base pairs is the actual carrier of genetic information for evolution

**The Nature of Biological Information**:
- Distinguishing biological information from other forms of structure in biology is necessary for understanding its role in replication and evolution
- Biological information cannot be equated with physical structure or order alone

**Early Genetic Thinking**:
- Prevailing view before 1950: Genes transferred chemical specificity through time, not information
- Molecular recognition is based on a precise fit between molecules, resulting in relatively high stability due to weak chemical bonds.

**Molecular Recognition**:
- Random bumping together of large macromolecules leads to molecular recognition when surfaces match well
- Specificity arises from the ability of enzymes to physically latch onto specific types of molecules, allowing them to catalyze particular reactions.


#### Pauling's perspective on biological information: Structure, allosteric proteins, and lock-and-key model.

**Biological Information: Structure Determines Function**

**Introduction**:
- Pauling's belief that "structure determines function" extends to gene-based inheritance
- Proteins can attach to DNA based on complementary shapes, forming strong interactions
- These interactions regulate gene expression and transfer information through conformational changes

**Allosteric Proteins**:
- Certain proteins have multiple stable atomic configurations
- Allosteric proteins interact with each other, transferring information via structural changes in receiving molecules
- This requires close interaction for proper alignment and configurational change

**Biological Information vs. Physical Information**:
- Biological information is capable of transferring constraints or specificities of structure
- It arises when one bit of matter helps another become like itself
- Flexible, allosteric proteins are the defining factor for biological information

**Information Transfer Process**:
- Information is communicated through lock-and-key interactions between molecules
- Change in receiving molecule's shape is the message, not the new shape itself
- Both locks and keys change conformations in the transfer process

**Information Replication**:
- Duplication of original configuration occurs when a lock fits into its complementary key
- DNA replication is an example of this complementarity-based information replication

**Shannon's Theory of Communication**:
- Shannon's theory focuses on reducing uncertainty about message content, neutral to physicality
- Biological information requires meaning and function, not just structure or order

**Conclusion**:
- Biological information is a function of ordering physical matter with specific constraints and adaptability.


#### Replication and Information: Sticky Replicator Principle vs Functional Equivalence in Memetics.

**Replicators: The Sticky Replicator Principle**

**Replication Process**:
- Involves true information transfer
- Tied to a particular physical substrate
- Implies replicators are picky about what they will stick to and the contexts they are found in

**Sticky Replicator Principle**:
- Replicators are specific to one kind of material and stick to it
- Consequences:
  - Abstract conceptions of information won't wash for replication issues
  - Any theory involving replication must specify a physical claim about the replicator's mechanism

**Functional Equivalence**:
- Suggests if two things can do the same job, they are the same kind of thing
- Applied to replication leads to substrate-neutral memetics
  - Memes can exist on different substrates (brain, computer, paper) as long as they produce the same outputs

**Issues with Functional Equivalence**:
- Doesn't provide a clear mechanism for replication
- Can't distinguish memetics from other theories of cultural evolution
- Leads to explanatory futility in memetic studies

**Replication vs. Computation**:
- Replication is more precise than computation
- Functional equivalence is too loose a criterion for evolutionary purposes


#### Understanding Replication: Structural Equivalence for Memes and Genes

**Replication Theory: Understanding Replicators as Information Carriers**

**Background:**
- Replicators are fundamental units of inheritance
- Criteria for replication identified: causation, similarity, information transfer, duplication (Inheritance transferred as specificity)

**Replicator Theory:**
- Complementary understanding of replication phenomenon
- All criteria present in replicator equation and reaction concept
  - Information transfer: Replicator serves as own catalyst
  - Causation: Replicator catalyzes itself
  - Duplication: Beginning point for the process
  - Similarity: Goal of replication

**Physical Nature of Replicators:**
- Contrary to contemporary thinking, replicators must be physical things
- Genes and memes have various media for archival purposes
  * Books can be transferred to CD or sound waves
  * Genes can be sequenced and stored in computer memory

**Replicators vs. Memes:**
- Misconception: Neither memes nor genes exist in all media
- This proposition would lead to problematic consequences if true.

**Conclusion:**
- Replicators are fundamental units of inheritance with specific criteria (causation, similarity, information transfer, duplication) that define them as physical entities capable of self-replication. Their ability to exist in various media should not overshadow their essential nature as replicators.


### Chapter Six STALKING THE WILD MEME

**Memes: Stalking the Wild Meme**

**Background:**
- Memes defined as shared elements of culture learned through imitation from others
- Susan Blackmore's perspective: memes are information lodged in specific human memories, actions, and artifacts
- Dennett suggests memes exist both in the head and out in the world

**Questions Raised:**
1. Where are memes found? In behavior, brain, or artifacts?
2. How many ways can a meme be infected? From how many "cultural parents"?
3. How long can a meme live?
4. How do memetic alternatives compete with each other? What do they compete for?
5. What forces cause memes to mutate, and at what rate?
6. Are memes translated from one form to another, and how?

**Need for Understanding Mechanisms:**
- To identify a replicator, we must specify its replication reaction
- Memeticists have yet to determine the physical mechanics of memetic replication
- Importance of understanding mechanisms:
  - Parallels in genetics and epidemiology
  - Potential for advances in the field
  - Faulty analogy to Darwin's time argument won't work

**Implications:**
- Memes may be transmitted through epigenetic means, not just nature or nurture
- Memes could have a significant impact on our understanding of knowledge and society.


#### Memes as cultural replicators: brains vs. artifacts debate.

**Memes as Cultural Replicators: The Mental Substrate**

**Background:**
- Memes face unique challenges due to their dependence on genes and historical context
- Memetics can't ignore the role of genes in cultural inheritance
- The need for empirical evidence to support meme hypothesis

**Meme Substrate: Brains, Behaviors, or Artifacts?**

**Dawkins' Definition of Memes:**
- Initially included beliefs, behavior, and artifacts
- Later restricted to mental substrate as memetic "genotype"
- Belief that ideas are causally prior and more important than their products

**Memes as Ideas:**
- Dawkins believed memes exist in brains but can propagate through books, computers, etc.
- Memes are informational entities regardless of where they're stored

**Arguments Against Memes as Artifacts:**
- Cars aren't born; they are assembled from preprocessed materials
- Construction involves prior activities, making it less encapsulated than meme replication
- Similar issues arise with proteins

**Importance of Defining Meme Substrate:**
- Universal Darwinism doesn't provide clear reasons for preferring mental identification
- Need a substantial defense of the choice of substrate for memes.


#### Exploring cultural replicators: Behaviorism vs. mentalism debate, memes and replication criteria

**Differences Between Replication and Production: Ribosomes vs Automobiles**
- **Ribosomes**: Constructed through a complex process as part of cell growth; no instructions from previous ribosomes for next one's construction. Instructions come from DNA in the cytoplasm.
- **Automobiles**: Produced, not reproduced. No directive instructions on car robots' movements come from previous cars, but rather from a central computer program or human instructions.

**Artifacts as Replicators vs Memes**
- Artifacts can be replicators (e.g., Xeroxed patterns, computer viruses), but cannot explain the phenomenon of culture due to their recent existence and technological nature.
- Culture is older than artifacts; human culture requires an unlimited replicator for explanation.
- Behaviorism: Cultural replicators are behaviors that transmit signals from macroenvironment (physical world) to microenvironment (mind) and create new replicators in the form of similar behaviors.
- Mentalist perspective: Knowledge underlying cultural behaviors is the replicator, while generated behaviors are interactors.

**Behavioral Replication Criteria**
- Similarity: One "hello" equals another; spoken phrases have identical sound waves (sonograms).
- Causation: First man's greeting initiates a process resulting in second man producing a response.
- Choice of language used in greeting impacts nature of replay.


#### Exploring memes in behavior: Einstein's parrots and the transmission of ideas

**Information Transfer: Behavior vs. Memes**

**Behavior as a Replicator:**
- Example of "hello" exchange shows behavior doesn't duplicate
- Signal undergoes complex life cycle or sequence of independent productions
- No temporal overlap between the source and copy
- Duplication condition not fulfilled in behavior

**Memes vs. Behavior:**
- Behaviorist vs. Mentalist camps
- Einstein's Tea Party story: focus on how great German physicist Max Planck learned novel idea from Albert Einstein
- Empirical measures of vocalizations (sonograms) suggest similarity between humans and parrots
  - Impressive fidelity of transmission across species
- Transmission chain: human to bird and back again, with perfect repetition by last link in the chain

**Behavior as a Replicator vs. Memes:**
- Behaviorists argue behavior is meme
- Mentalists argue ideas are memes

**Einstein's Tea Party Story Analysis:**
- Human speech (behavior) appears to be transmitted from Einstein to parrot Jolly, then to parrot Polly, and finally to Max Planck
- Similarity in vocalizations suggests robust replicator ability
- Focus on the behavior as potential meme?

**Mentalist Argument:**
- Ideas behind "E=mc2" and connotations also passed through minds of characters in the story
- Not clear which aspect, behavior or idea, is the meme.


#### Behavior and memes: human vs parrot transmission dynamics

**Behaviorism and Memes**

**Replication of Mental Structures**:
- Likely not possible to transfer from one species' brain to another due to differences in brain structure
- Behavior is more likely to cross the species barrier than mental representations

**Evolutionary Dynamics**:
- Determine where the replicator lies, rather than comparing "similarity" of mental and behavioral representation
- Gertrude (Einstein's maid) did not understand the meaning of "E=mc2", even if she remembered the phrase
- Difficulties in translating between human languages and parrot language

**Transmission Fidelity**:
- In a human lineage, fidelity depends on ability to imitate local behavior and correct errors
- In a parrot lineage, high fidelity with low mutation rates but no error correction

**Transmission Modes**:
- Humans can maintain communication chains through various means (e.g., printed materials, electronic media)
- Parrots cannot read or use computers, limiting their information transmission methods


#### The brain as an isolated and protected environment for meme replication. Exploring its suitability according to Replicator Theory.

**Memetics: The Role of Brains as Memes' Substrate**

**Observable vs. Long-Term Dynamics**:
- Observable is brief exchange of information during social interactions
- Evolutionary focus is on long-term dynamics and fate of replicator lineages

**Mental Similarity and Replication of Mental Content**:
- Behaviorists argue mental similarity includes all intricacies of implication and inference
- This would mean links to everything the individual knows about Einstein, not just "E=mc2"
- However, complicated network of associations is individual and cannot be part of a single replicating meme
- Memes may be cobbled together associations that become associated only in particular contexts

**Behaviorist Objections and Response**:
- Behaviorists argue memetics focusing on brain is unobservable and thus empirically impossible
- This confuses subjective with objective aspects of mental events
- Brain activity can be observed using sensors and imaging technologies like EEG and MRI
- Genes were once unobservable but physicalized, and the same could happen for memes

**The Brain as a Likely Substrate for Memes**:
- The brain is an isolated, protective environment where replicators could evolve
- It provides ambient energy and scaffolding for replication reactions
- The hard braincase protects it from physical trauma and radiation
- Cerebrospinal fluid provides buoyancy and mechanical support
- The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain from external signals and viruses


### Chapter Seven MEMES AS A STATE OF MIND

**Chapter Seven: Memes as a State of Mind**

**The Evolution of Replicators**
- **Memes**: initially replicated within individual brains due to chemical processes in the brain, determined by laws of chemistry, not logic.
- Nervous systems allowed for meme replication:
  - Emergence of single-celled organisms with facilities for receiving information and taking action on behalf of genes.
  - Development of more complex organisms with cooperating cells, including neurons that produced electrical spikes instead of chemical signals.
  - Formation of centralized nervous systems with specialized neurons for sensory input, motor output, and interneuron communication.

**The Electric Meme**
- Neurons collaborated to make finer discriminations about the world around them, leading to the formation of memory clusters.
- Specialized neurons emerged to manage internal organization within the brain.
- Evolution of the human brain: increasing size and complexity with a larger neocortex and neocerebellum.

**The Human Brain and Memes**
- Humans have about 100 billion neurons that form a complex communicative network, with approximately 100 trillion connections.
- Each cubic millimeter of cortical tissue includes 100,000 neurons, 500 million dendrites, and nearly 1 billion synapses.
- Neurons are structurally and electrically polarized, with specialized ends for receiving signals (dendrites) and transmitting signals.


#### Neuron communication: Dendrites, synapses, and plastic brains' development

**Neuron Functioning**
- Dendrites act as "bushy antenna" receiving signals from other neurons
- Stimulation of dendrite triggers action potential or spike in cell body
- Axon generates millisecond-long pulse, sending signal to synaptic terminal
- Synapses transmit chemical or electrical signals across gap between cells
- Activate receptors on target cell membrane for message transmission

**Synapse and Neuron Interconnection**
- Each neuron has up to 10,000 synapses from about 1,000 other neurons
- On average, each neuron touches another in 10 places
- Synaptic connections ensure complex decision making processes for interneuronal communication

**Neuron Complexity and Evolution**
- Bigger brains evolved due to enhanced lives of animals
- Simple nervous systems respond directly to sensory information
- Fixed action patterns arise from genetic code underlying brain development
- Learning allows changes in responses based on new experiences
- Human twins exhibit differences despite genetic identity

**Brain Plasticity and Complexity**
- Bigger brains provide greater plasticity of response
- More complex nervous systems create truly staggering possibilities for flexible responses
- Genes cannot directly specify the exact topology of neural networks
- Indirect determination of final brain form through gene-set rules.


#### The role of genes and experience in shaping complex structures like the brain

**Complexity of Objects from Heterogeneous Interactions**
- Complex objects can be created by a small number of heterogeneous objects interacting with one another
- Neuronal connectivity is determined by general rules, not specific neuron characteristics
- Genes act like recipes, allowing neurons to adapt to the environment they find themselves in

**Genes vs. Recipes: Creating Complex Structures**
- Genes don't act as blueprints; they provide instructions for development
- A few genes can have significant effects on final shape and function of a body
- Brain growth is controlled by Hox genes, which determine very general processes

**Neuronal Development: Experience Shaping the Mind**
- The brain goes through multiple phases of synaptic change during development
  - Before birth: 3 out of 5 phases occur
  - Early childhood: 4th phase leads to remarkable changes in neuron count
  - Adolescence: Last phase, characterized by slower decline in synaptic connections

**Brain Development: Use It or Lose It Hypothesis**
- Brains are always in flux due to sensory stimulation and fine-tuning
- Mutation rate constraints the complexity of phenotypes natural selection can preserve
- Evolution of larger nervous systems allows for information storage outside the genome

**Advantages of Big Brains: Flexibility and Learning**
- Genes favor learning over instincts when acquiring difficult-to-code information
- Increased brain size increases neuron count within the cranium faster than surface neurons


#### Brain functions: Memory and self-referentiality, memes as information replication in the brain.

**The Brain as a Self-Generating Environment**

**Behavior and Sensory Stimuli**:
- Contrary to the idea that behavior is a reaction to sensory stimuli, much of the brain's activity comes from internally generated information
- The brain continually reassesses the current situation based on memory
- The brain represents its own place in the body and world, using this model to interpret new inputs

**Brain as a "Solipsistic" Organ**:
- The brain becomes its own environment, responding primarily to stimuli it has generated rather than received
- This makes the brain a "solsipsistic" organ, capable of self-replication

**Memes as Replicators in the Brain**:
- Memes may arise from changes in brain states that are not accompanied by DNA expression
- Learning mechanisms suggest short-term memory changes occur without gene involvement
- Memories are stored as changes in synaptic connections, which can be modified through three main processes:
  - Recruiting new neurons
  - Forming new synaptic connections between existing neurons
  - Changing the strength of existing synaptic connections


#### Neuronal plasticity: Synaptic connections and long-term memory storage without gene expression

**Neuronal Plasticity and Synaptic Connections:**
- **Third mechanism for altering synaptic connections**: Complex phenomenon involving physical and chemical factors
- Important role in memory storage
- Can be strengthened or weakened in milliseconds (short-term memory)

**Long-Term Memory:**
- Consolidation changes in synaptic plasticity involve a protein called **CREB**
- Gene transcription critical for long-lasting changes in neuronal networks
- Gene expression can be localized to individual synapses, resulting in production of proteins under local control

**Short-Term Memory:**
- Independent of new protein synthesis
- Synaptic plasticity contributes to short-term memory storage as well
- Changes occur without immediate instruction from nuclear DNA

**Independence from Genes:**
- Short-term changes in synaptic plasticity do not depend on gene expression for milliseconds-level changes at individual synapses.
- This domain of brain activity is unlikely to be explained by gene expression mechanisms alone.

**Integration of Short and Long Term Memory:**
- Short-term memory changes likely trigger long-term consolidation processes
- Two distinct kinds of information in the brain, with different dynamics and causal structures

**Implications for Memes:**
- Short-term memory mechanisms can create memetic information independently of gene-produced memories.
- This information can be transmitted between individuals without dependence on genetic assignment (like prions).


#### Neuronal communication and the replication of neuronal states as memes through neuromemetics.

**Neuromemetics: Defining Memes as a State of Mind**

**Background:**
- Search for meme definition focusing on physical substrate and replication mechanism
- Abstract definitions of memes are insufficient, must be associated with specific neuronal network aspects

**Arguments against Synaptic Connection Model:**
- Contradicts current understanding of distributed memory in the brain
- Memories cannot be physically extracted from the brain

**Proposed Definition: Memes as an Aspect of Neuronal Networks**
- Memes are a class of memories that can copy themselves
- Replication occurs in the context of communication between neurons

**Neuronal Communication vs. Replication:**
1. Neuronal communication: Information passes from one node to another, but states are not duplicated
2. State-switching: One node's state moves to another after stimulation, with no replication
3. True replication of neuronal states through communication: Both nodes exhibit the same state simultaneously, fulfilling all four conditions for replication (causation, similarity, relatedness by descent, and duplication)

**Additional Considerations:**
- Neuromemetics: Electrochemical states of neurons serve as foundation for study
- Vague about physical scale of replication due to current ignorance on neural functioning details
- Using "node" to indicate where replication happens.


#### Neuromemes: Electric states as replicators in neuroscientific memetics

**Neuromemetics: Understanding Neuronal Interaction and Memes as States of Mind**

**Definition of Meme:**
- A configuration in one node of a neuronal network that induces the replication of its state in other nodes (Sperling, 2023)
- Not limited to single neurons or synapses but can be ensembles of strongly interconnected neurons
- Replication occurs when a meme causes similar states in multiple nodes, either in the same or another physical group
- Memes are physical things, electrical in nature, tied to neurons but not identical to them

**Types of Neuronal Interactions:**
1. **Neuronal Communication:**
   - Spike leaves source node in a new state and changes receiving node
   - No duplication of states (Sperling, 2023)
2. **Neuronal State-switching:**
   - Source node changes from state A to B but leaving the receiving node in its original state
   - Movement, not duplication (Sperling, 2023)
3. **Neuronal State Replication:**
   - Source and receiving nodes settle into state A or B; alternatively, source node changes to state A while leaving two receiving nodes in the same state
   - Causation, similarity, inheritance, and duplication fulfilled (Sperling, 2023)

**Neuromeme Characteristics:**
- Configuration: Determines a node's propensity to fire based on neurotransmitters, proteins, glia, and nitrous oxide present
- Not defined as probability but measured in physical complement of molecules
- Specific stimuli required for replication (Sperling, 2023)

**Implications:**
1. Preserves the distinction between informational templates and dynamic entities
2. Memes are not bound to particular cells; their substrate is energetic rather than material
3. Precise relationship between memes and signals they produce necessary for replication in various stages of information processing through brains.


#### Neuromemes as separable, functionally identical replicators within a network.

**Meme Replication and Identical Descent**

**Meme Replication**:
- Meme does not depend on identity of individual neurons or their unique connectivity to other neurons
- Memes can replicate, move from area to area, and stimulate other nodes to join in the infectious state
- Ability to replicate is crucial for continued replication of a meme in different locations and persistence of memetic lineages

**Freedom from Materiality**:
- Meme information can travel across nodes into the environment
- Transmissibility is crucial for memes to be replicated in different locations

**Divisibility and Corpuscles of Culture**:
- Memes are separable, even though brain is composed of a single neuronal network
- Specific node involved in manifestation of a meme
- Multiple memes can be latent in the same node, waiting for proper stimulus to express

**Replication Process**:
- Neuronal state stores information and serves as interpretable instruction to initiate replication process
- Information in a replicator must serve two functions: as a store of information and as an interpretable instruction
- Neuronal state can both be read (interpreted) by a catalyst and implicitly represent other things

**Identical Descent**:
- Two nodes are identical by descent if they have the same parental nodes and are similar in quality
- Similarity is based on the Same Influence Rule, which requires nodes to pass information through the neuronal network in the same way
- Memetic states can be reproduced with some fidelity in different parts of the same brain and between brains

**Equivalence of Nodes**:
- Two nodes releasing the same pattern of spikes at different places may not drive the dynamics of the brain from the same angle
- However, they may still be equivalent if they participate in the same decision-making circuit and add the same kind of value to their local information processing stream


#### Memes: Replication, Stationary Model, Neurons, Feedback Loops, Short and Long Term Memory

**Neurons and Memes:**
- **Stationary Meme Model**:
  * Replication occurs through electro-chemical processes within the cell or feedback from outside the cell
  * Short loop: reciprocal connections between different areas of cortex
  * Long loop: signals sent out into macroenvironment come back in, reinciting stimulation of source node
* **Mobile Meme Model**:
  * Source node loses original state but induces two downstream nodes to become infectious

**Stationary Meme Replication:**
- Electro-chemical process within the cell ensures maintenance of state despite disturbances
- Feedback from outside the cell: short loop (within brain) or long loop (microenvironment feedback)
  * Short loop: reciprocal connections between different areas of cortex
  * Long loop: signals sent out into macroenvironment come back in, reinciting stimulation of source node
- Interaction between short-term and long-term memory mechanisms can bring nodes back into an infectious state after firing

**Long-Term Memory Consolidation:**
- Memories become chemically unstable every time they are retrieved
- Reconsolidation occurs: new proteins synthesized to reinforce or update memories
  * Can lead to false memories if information is not consistent with original memory
- Infectious states can be fixed in place by protein synthesis if reconsolidation mechanism kicks in

**Long-Term Memory and Memes:**
- Memes can modify long-term memories during recall and prior to reconsolidation through fast-acting mechanisms
- This allows memes to remain on the spot, as they are not restricted to short-term memory.


#### The text discusses the mobility and transmission of memes in the brain using an electrical soup analogy. It explains that memes are like letters floating on a sea of chemicals, moving around and changing connections to create variation and evolution. The text suggests that neurons must remain adaptable to accommodate new information and memories while keeping some degree of consistency.

**Meme Replication: The Second Model**
- Movement of original meme from one location to another
- Neurons have flexible receptive fields that can shift quickly
- Implications for longevity and creation of lineages

**Neural Adaptability**
- Brain faces competing goals: learning and memory
- Spatial segregation in hippocampus for selective admission into long-term storage
- Neurons must remain highly adaptable to accommodate various functions

**Memes as Free Replicators: The Brain as a "Soup"**
- Memes compared to computer viruses and prions
- Move freely in the brain, segregated from long-term memory
- Change connections, relationships, neurotransmitters, and chemical partners

**Neocortex as a Vast Landscape**
- Neurons serve various functions with some consistency
- Varied locations for higher functions like planning and executive control
- Memes need not be tied to specific locations

**Transmission of Memes: The Electrical Soup Analogy**
- Brain is an electrical soup, memes are lighted portions on a massive network of wires
- Memetic variation and evolution can occur easily through changes in the wiring diagram
- Closer familial ties between some memes (A to B easier than A to C)
- Reverse mutations less common due to neuron adaptability.


#### Brain as a small world network: memes' survival and evolution through dynamic connections

**Neuromemetics: Memes as a State of Mind**

**Differences Between Memes Models:**
- **Stationary Meme Model**: Memes consist of an ensemble of components, with replicator nodes being somewhat complex
- **Mobile Meme Model**: Memes are more dynamic and can rapidly evolve within a host's brain

**Brain Structure and Connectivity:**
- Brain is a "small world" network: Connected through short chains of intermediary nodes
- Every neuron is connected to other disparate neighborhoods via long-distance connections
- Small-world networks enhance signal propagation, computational power, and synchronization

**Malleability of Memories:**
- Brain changes rapidly, making it a challenge for memory stability
- Neuromemes evolve within the brain through mutation and diversification
- Variant forms of neuromeme can coexist in one brain and dominate meme population
- Flexibility within host's lifetime is an expectation of neuromemetics, not a conundrum.


#### Memes as rapid information replicators in the brain: evolution and complexity.

**Replication in the Brain: Meme Theory**

**Reasons for Replicating**
- To account for redundancy in a system where neurons can die
- Genetic evolution uses multiple copies of information as backup and adaptation
- Redundancy ensures fault tolerance
- Information is stored in multiple locations, reducing the risk of loss

**Origin of Intra-Brain Memory Replication**
- Distributed representation and multistage incorporation of memory lead to replication
- The need for efficient memory representation drives replication

**Meme as a State of Mind**
- Memes may evolve from the back-up process in the brain
- Information moves around within the brain, with potential for duplication and replication
- Duplication is common, especially in big brains

**Meme Replication Mechanisms**
- Neurons can be replaced, but knowledge cannot be easily transferred to a new neuron
- Redundancy ensures that information is not lost even if a neuron dies
- Memes may have originated from the need to keep copies of crucial information

**Replicator Theory and Meme Evolution**
- Replication determines evolutionary dynamics: Only fittest memes survive and combine to produce more complex adaptations.
- Linear or Malthusian growth allows for meme complexity to increase over time.


#### Meme replication and its parallels with other replicators: unlimited, modular, and robust.

**Meme Replication and Memes as a State of Mind**

**Meme Replication**:
- Sequence of steps:
  - Incoming stimuli serve as "super-molecular equivalent of catalysts"
  - Signal transfers memetic information from source node to replication assistants or catalyzes functionality
  - Original stimulus sets off "chain reaction" through downstream node, leaving it in an infectious state
  - New stimulus is produced and can transmit infection to other nodes
- One preexisting meme required for another to be produced

**Meme Replication Characteristics**:
- Parallels with prions and computer viruses:
  - Can replicate via conversion of neuronal substrate
  - Can become non-infectious when neuronal node is not a replicator
  - Can replicate through super-molecular instigators (signal-stimuli)
- Exist on single substrate (neurons)

**Meme Unlimited Replication**:
- Memes may be unlimited replicators, able to maintain evolutionary lineage despite mutations
- Requires neuronal nodes to take on many states and remain infectious
- Comparison to genes, prions, and computer viruses suggests memes are modular and unlimited

**Memes as a State of Mind**:
- Memes must run the gauntlet of selection, with only the fittest surviving
- Display other parallels with prions and computer viruses
- Exist on a single substrate (neurons)

**Open Questions**:
- Unclear whether neuronal nodes can take on many states and remain infectious
- Need to know more about the brain to answer this question


#### Neuroscientific exploration of memetic selection and brain's unconscious processing.

**Neuronal Representation and Memetics:**
* The larger the brain, the more robust memes become as they can organize at higher levels (higher neuronal territory)
* Early memes lacked significant plasticity due to fewer neurons involved and simpler structures
* Over time, memes have become increasingly complex and powerful, mirroring the expansion of brains
* Selection plays an important role in evolution of ideas (memes) at two levels: mind and performance
* Conscious decision making involves choosing among alternative ideas through a process of selection
* Unconscious selection also occurs before ideas reach consciousness
* Brain signals responding to events can be mirrored at multiple places, creating competition among interpretations for behavioral response direction
* Synchronization coordinates behavioral responses based on best thinking and suppresses cheating behaviors
* Attention acts as a top-down selection system among competing spike trains, favoring responses conducive to organism's survival and reproduction.

**Memetic Evolution:**
* Memes, like organisms, tend to perpetuate their structure and breed, fuse, recombine, segregate content, and evolve
* Selection operates at two levels: mind and performance
* Performance value depends on change brought to behavior of person or group that adopts an idea
* Spreading power (infectivity) of ideas depends on preexisting structures in the mind and innate structures.


#### Neuroscientific perspective on memes: States as physical structures with context-dependent meaning and representation through firing patterns.

**The Neuromemetic Perspective on Meme Replication**

**Selection Mechanisms**:
- A meme can be selected for:
  - **Memory retention**: Ability to maintain its state
  - **Producing a spike train**: Winning in decision-making competitions
  - **Being responsible for beneficial behavioral responses**: Strengthens ties to other nodes, increasing chances of winning next time

**Decision-Making as Darwinian Selection**:
- Decision-making is a process of Darwinian selection in the brain
- Alternative scenarios are put up, let them "battle it out", and the surviving candidate determines action
- Tentative ideas are "chopped off" by selective agents
- Favored memes are favored for further propagation

**Memes as States of Mind**:
- Memes don't represent anything, they just are
- Memes produce spikes that express their "intention"
- Meaning is context-dependent and unrepeatable, so it cannot be equated with memes
- Memes are physical structures that implicitly represent something through their capability to produce specific spikes

**Cognitive Complexity of Spike Representation**:
- Between a sensory stimulus and motor output, there can be numerous links between neurons
- Neurons pass messages until a resolution about what to do emerges
- Each node's output represents a complex aspect of the input, depending on its place in the chain of activation


#### Neuromemetics: Memes as complex neural representations with variable meanings and possible early origins

**Neuromemetics: Memes as a State of Mind**

**Hierarchical Processing and Neuromemes**:
- Sequential nature of cortical processing allows for complex representational levels
- Memes can exist at any stage in the sequential process
- Spike trains produced by memes can represent a range of implicit representations
- Memes may not be limited to conceptual level, but can also represent primitive distinctions or entire traditions

**Concepts and Mental Representations**:
- Concepts are heterogeneous complexes made up of more primitive cognitive bits and pieces
- Current psychological theories suggest concepts are constructed during a developmental process
- No two high-level representations are likely to be exactly alike, varying from individual to individual

**Neuromeme Replication**:
- The relationship between neuromeme state, spike train, and behavior may not be simple
- No easy rules exist for converting neuromeme state to observable behavior
- Identifying the parameters in spike trains that are relevant for meme replication is unclear

**Memetic Variability**:
- A single spike train may represent different memes in different contexts
- Memes may share a physical similarity despite representing different meanings
- This counterintuitive, but reflects the neuronal nature of memory storage

**Origin of Memes**:
- Neuromemetics suggests memes could have originated earlier than previously thought
- Requires the presence of programmable neurons, which only became possible with larger brains


#### Memes as social, cooperative entities in the brain's evolution

**The Electric Meme: Memes as Replicators in the Brain**

**Origins of Memes:**
- Began life within simple-minded organisms' brains
- Physical tokens that have evolved to reproduce and adapt
- Coopted learning mechanisms for their own purposes

**Memetic Evolution:**
- Competition for replication: minimizing non-essential activities, small-sized replicators
- Parasitic relationships evolve (parasites on parasites)
- Complexity favored when transmission depends on useful work beyond reproduction

**Functions of Memes:**
- Produce adaptive behavior in organisms
- Cooperative evolution: both genes and memes promote "good" behavior
- Need to cooperate leads to complexity and symbiotic relationships

**Meme Evolution Environment:**
- Differentiated from independent replicators like genes or prions
- Social entities with physical ties to one another as parts of a neuronal network
- Cooperation necessary for survival and reproduction

**Nature of Neuromemes:**
- Memes tend to be symbiotic parasites, not virulent
- Successful memes are gregarious and tolerant
- Human success dependent on coevolution with memes

**Implications:**
- Memetic evolution occurs in a different environment than standard selection criteria
- Memes and organisms have a real symbiotic relationship
- Misconceptions of host-destroying memes are mistaken.


### Chapter Eight ESCAPE FROM PLANET BRAIN

**Escape from Planet Brain**

**Peirce's Perspective**:
- Direct communication of ideas requires icons
- Indirect methods of communicating ideas depend on the use of icons

**The Problem of Solipsism**:
- Philosophers question whether we are isolated in our own minds
- We may be "dreaming" or just virtual programs running on a massive computer

**Memetics and Mind-to-Mind Communication**:
- Memes must have a life cycle that includes transmission from host to host
- Infected hosts produce "icons" (vectors) for the meme to travel through
- The infected brain then decodes the vector, becoming a new host

**The Interactor Question**:
- How do memes act like their biological counterparts in transmitting themselves?
- Unlimited replicators must be "heterocatalytic" like prions or computer viruses
- Memes engage in both replicative and phenotypic behavior

**Memes as Memories**:
- Memes are essentially memories that need to be recalled, not just replicated
- Recall (with reconsolidation) is a "dead-end" information production process for the meme


#### Exploring memes as signals and their role in transmitting phenotypic information.

**Meme Transmission: Signals as Phenotypes**

**Problems with Viewing Signals as Meme Vehicles:**
- Susceptible to corruption and division
- Loss of information during translation between coding systems
- Memes can't replicate or carry the whole blueprint themselves

**Signals as Memetic Phenotypes:**
- Signals progress from one brain to another, carrying potentially modified phenotypic information
- Memes must still have a means for social transmission and the development of culture.

**Problems with this Perspective:**
- It is unclear how memes can replicate or carry the whole blueprint if they are not the message but only its expression in signals.
- This perspective contradicts the presumption that the replicator must be carried along inside the interactor, as observed with genes.


#### Signals as instigators in memetics: conserving information through replication reactions.

**Memetics: Understanding Signals as Instigators**

**Background**
- Memetic inheritance is a Lamarckian process where acquired variation becomes source for replication reactions
- Weismann's discovery disproved soft inheritance, stating that acquired changes don't affect the germ line
- memetics faces challenges in accounting for rapidly changing culture and maintaining information stream for new generations

**Signals as Instigators**
- Signals are not interactors or phenotypes
- Instead, they are "instigators" triggering replication reactions in the brain
- Memes remain in their original location while signals seek out new hosts to create sister memes
- Signals function as packets of patterned energy and ensure inheritance relation through identical meme production.

**Role of Signals**
- Memes send forth a signal that searches for novel locations to replicate
- The originating meme remains idle while the signal interacts with the environment and finds a new host
- Signals act as catalysts or matchmakers, accelerating or facilitating the replication process.

**Implications**
- This perspective conserves information by keeping memes within their original location
- It provides an explanation for cultural transmission without losing essential information.


#### Memetic replication through neural signals: Instigators instead of interactors (Memetics, Signal Transmission)

**The Electric Meme: Understanding Memetic Replication through Signals as Instigators**

**Overview:**
- Memes are not inter actors or phenotypes but signal instigators
- Signals contain information leading to meme replication in new hosts
- No direct meme-to-meme contact during replication

**Meme Replication:**
- Does not involve construction of new substrate
- Flipping neuron states to create memetic state
- Minimal role for signals: contain necessary information for replication reactions

**Signal and Meme Relationship:**
- Arbitrary relationship, not necessarily thematic or symbolic
- Signals may inspire conversion in existing neuronal nodes
- No incorporation of variation introduced during transmission into the offspring meme

**Implications:**
- Memetic lineages can persist over time despite low-fidelity signal replication
- Information theory applies to memes as signals are responsible for their replication.

**Meme Transmission:**
- Social signaling is an elaboration of meme strategy in earlier phases of evolution
- Neuronal signals transduced from electrical pulse within the cell to chemical neurotransmitters between cells
- Signals may be transmitted through various forms (photon streams) for external communication.


#### The evolution and selection of memes as social signals in the brain and beyond.

**The Difference Between Neurons and Motor Neurons:**
- Older parts of the cortex are responsible for motor programs
- Communication through behavior is ancient and prevalent in animals

**Meme Transmission:**
- Memes piggyback on a primitive function of non-memetic neurons
- Survive original host and engage in new evolutionary process
- Selection processes exist both within brains and between them

**Challenges for Social Signals:**
- Physical obstacles: distance to next uninfected host, disruptors
- Mental obstacles: competition from alternative ideas

**The Poverty of the Stimulus:**
- Chomsky's argument that what gets transmitted is insufficient in content
- Gaps in messages require filler for correct interpretation.


#### Communication and evolution: Reconstructing meaning from impoverished signals and biased replication.

**Communication Process: Replication vs. Mutation**

**Depauperate Messages**:
- Necessary information is not fully transmitted from sender to receiver
- Receivers must interpret and reconstruct meaning based on the message and contextual factors

**Rich Response and Evolutionary Psychology**:
- Humans have evolved mental structures (modules) that allow reliable inference of missing information
- These "rich responses" can result in replication of the original message, despite its poverty
- Memes that fit these preexisting modules for processing are more likely to survive

**Instigation and Conversion**:
- Signals are instigators, playing a small but crucial role in meme-making
- Memes work through the conversion of an existing substrate, rather than constructing something new from scratch

**Mutability vs. Cumulative Adaptation**:
- Errors introduced during transmission can still lead to cumulative adaptation if they are not biased
- A psychological bias can cause memetic norms to tend toward a new value, leading to evolutionary change


#### Memes as parasites: Memetics, communication evolution, and complex signals.

**Evolution of Memes through Social Signaling:**
* Memetic replication occurs through social signaling as an alternative way to maintain information inheritance
* Precise replication rarely happens, but long-term consequences lead to cumulative adaptation over time
* Heavy-duty reconstruction at receiving end doesn't exclude memes from being replication events
* Social communication systems vary in sophistication; evolution led to more complex memes
* Memes evolved as parasites on chains of communication in species with larger nervous systems and better social learning abilities
* Signals became objects of selection, leading to increased complexity through aggregation into sequences (e.g., language)
* Evolutionary advances include signal generators, interpreters, and the ability for signals to form cooperative messages (sentences)
* Selection pressures led to quick comprehension and parsing of continuous streams of inputs into meaningful units (words).


#### Evolution of memes and communication: brain as meme host and coevolution with genes.

**The Evolution of Communicative Systems**

**The Need for More Interesting Messages**:
- Generators of signals needed to produce more interesting messages to parse
- Required better cognitive abilities for buffering output as sentences were being put together
- Stored partially interpreted messages at the other end, awaiting full sense expression and receipt

**The Role of Neural Mechanisms in Language Evolution**:
- Most "action" occurred in the neural mechanisms for generating and interpreting spikes
- Supports reliable and accurate conversion of neuronal states, even if infectious
- A mere inducement (e.g., "hello") can set off the replication process, even when the source is far away

**The Evolution of Memes**:
- Each brain is an independent universe, with memes evolving independently in each
- Memes may have evolved adaptations and complexities to increase their survival chances
- The basic conditions for memetic evolution were always the same, as brains evolved
- Memes could "migrate" from one evolutionary context to another through social communication

**The Coevolution of Genes and Memes**:
- Genes and culture have coevolved, leading to "innate" traits that support cultural abilities (e.g., language processing)
- Memes have developed more elaborate life cycles and interactions with the environment
- This has led to a greater dependency of the human brain on memes over time

**Rethinking Communication**:
- Communication is defined as a process in which messages (typically translated into signals) are produced and consumed
- This process can occur at various scales, from atoms to organisms
- The sender, receiver, and consumer of the message need not be the same


#### Communication: Mechanical and Inferential Approaches (Shannon vs. Human Interaction)

**Communication Processes: Mechanical vs Inferential Approaches**

**Mechanical Approach**:
- Based on mathematical model of communication
- Devised to design telephone-switching networks
- Primary focus on efficiently transmitting messages through channels with highest possible fidelity
- Sender selects message, codes it into a signal that travels through a communication channel
- Receiver decodes the signal back into a message for destination
- Differences between sent and received messages due to corruption by noise or interference
- Solution: situate an observer outside the communication channel to note discrepancies and transmit corrections
- Limited understanding of sender's and receiver's psychology or intersubjectivity

**Inferential Approach**:
- Limited to intentional agents, with human conversation as a key example
- Communication involves production, decoding of signals, **and inferring intentions** by both senders and receivers
- Rooted in the work of philosopher H.P. Grice
- Recognizes communicative events must be understood before they can be successful
- Scope more restricted than Mechanical approach but reflects human cognitive abilities.


#### Communication theories: Mechanical, Inferential, and Evolutionary approaches to meaning exchange.

**Communication Theories: Mechanical vs Inferential vs Evolutionary Approaches**

**Mechanical Approach**:
- Focuses on how information is transmitted between sender and receiver
- Emphasizes the efficiency of message transfer
- Does not explain why communication occurs or who can engage in it
- Has limited theory on message content

**Inferential Approach**:
- Sees communication as a mutual negotiation of meaning
- Challenges the Mechanical approach's equating of meaning with messages
- Believes that much of what is inferred from messages is not transmitted, but rather derived by the receiver from the communicative situation
- Lacks a theory for how the source selects among possible messages to send
- Assumes cooperation between message senders and receivers, which may be unusual

**Evolutionary Approach**:
- Describes the evolution of signaling behaviors in animals
- Communication is a specialized behavior involving the broadcast of information
- Selection acts over generations to change an animal's repertoire of displays that provide information about its condition or environment
- The behavioral context in which the cue is produced and received is ritualized to minimize ambiguity

**Key Differences**:
- **Mechanical Approach**: Focuses on single events of information exchange, with a goal of efficient message transfer
- **Inferential Approach**: Sees communication as mutual negotiation of meaning, where much inferred meaning is not transmitted
- **Evolutionary Approach**: Describes the evolutionary basis for animal signaling behaviors that provide information about conditions or situations


#### Communication theory: Sender, receiver, and message evolution through populations and chains.

**Communication Chains and Evolutionary Approach**

**Dissemination vs. Communication Events**:
- Dissemination: profligate sender broadcasting signals into environment, hoping to find receivers
- Recognition of repeatability and information spreading through a population

**Dyadic Communication Event Limitations**:
- Mechanical and Inferential approaches ignored communication chains and message modification
- Evolutionary approach expands temporal/spatial horizon to focus on population-level phenomena

**Communication Chains and Descent with Modification**:
- Repeated communication results in desent with modification of constituent information
- Evolutionary story about stories: how lives and social traditions interact over time

**Biological and Cultural Evolution as Message-Passing**:
- Evolution of messages missed if focusing only on brain (psychology) or dyad (communicative acts)
- Biological and cultural evolution as a story of message-passing through DNA or cultural messages

**Problems Addressed by the Evolutionary Approach**:
- Doesn't assume sender and receiver intend to cooperate
- Accounts for diverging biological interests leading to arms race in signaling abilities

**Message Content and Constraints on Transmission**:
- Evolutionary approach suggests signals may arise from pre-existing sensory biases
- Lacks mechanism for selecting among possible messages to send
- Focuses on individual organism's perspective (sender or receiver)

**Coevolutionary Approach as an Alternative**:
- Communication involves sender, receiver, channel, and message
- Adaptation in senders, receivers, and parasites that interact with communication process
- Emphasizes successful communication can result in replenishment of information conveyed.


#### Coevolutionary approach to communication: Memes as parasitic replicators and signals' role in meme propagation

**Coevolutionary Approach to Communication**

**Background:**
- Evolution of human communication involves cognitive sophistication and novel channels
- Coevolutionary approach links communication to large-scale social phenomena, cultural change
- Two relationships: sender and receiver as conspecifics with potential divergent interests, and potential hosts to a parasitic replicator (meme)

**Primary Differences from Evolutionary Approach:**
- Signals defined as "free-living," extended phenotypic products of memes
- Communication is one stage in a meme's life cycle
- Meme replication occurs through signals; parasite resides inside the brain

**Implications for Psychology:**
- Potential conflict of interest between receiver and message
- Adaptations to deal with memes and their signals (instigators of replication)

**Content of Signals:**
- Instigators of meme replication in both brains
- Pressured to convey information vital for meme reproduction
- Design features: survive travel through macroenvironment, carry crucial bits of information

**Message Selection:**
- Adaptations in message-sending brain for selecting reliable messages
- Preferred messages fit processing modules in receiving brain

**Advancements over Alternative Approaches:**
- Coevolutionary approach provides implications for channels and signals that other approaches lack.

**Examples of Insights from Coevolutionary Models:**
- Sex evolved to take advantage of genetic recombination in sexual reproduction
- Variation maintained within species to deal with rapidly evolving parasites
- Coevolution produces optimal outcomes or more rapidly achieves fitness in various disciplines, including computer science.


#### The debate over imitation's role in memetic replication and its psychological requirements.

**Cultural Traits as Parasites and Memes**
- Considering cultural traits as parasites or replicating memes may provide insight into communication process

**Imitation vs. Imitation as a Psychological Ability**
- Imitation is problematic as a concept due to lack of understanding on how it happens
- Cultural selectionists argue imitation is necessary for culture's emergence in humans, but its mechanics remain unclear
- Social learning includes various skills like paying attention to situational context or demonstrator's movements
  - Imitation involves acquiring rules for new behaviors through observation

**Debate on Requirements for Imitation**
- Mentalists argue imitation requires "theory of mind" and complex mental representations
  - Enables inferring intentions behind behavior and learning new skills
- Behaviorists argue imitation can occur without complex mental abilities
  - Rapid, unreinforced learning of novel behaviors suggests general proclivity to imitate

**Importance of Resolving Imitation Debate**
- Determines which species are capable of cultural evolution if imitation is restricted to certain ones (e.g., apes, humans)
  - Birds might be excluded if imitation requires big brains or complex mental abilities.


#### Imitation as a mechanism for cultural evolution: challenges and limitations.

**Singing Behavior and Imitation**
- Birdsong exhibits characteristics of cultural evolution (mutation, drift, directional selection) but does not involve true imitation
- This introduces a problem for theories of cultural evolution based on imitation: birds can have culture without the ability to imitate
- Complex population-level effects can arise despite limited cognitive abilities in populations
- Cultural selectionists argue that imitation is still the mechanism of cultural learning, even if animals exhibit culture without imitating

**The Problem of Fidelity in Transmission**
- Imitation may not provide sufficient psychological services to insulate socially transmitted information from modification
- Culturally acquired ideas are often lost or transformed in memory after acquisition (Chinese whispers example)
- To ensure reliable inheritance, imitation must be buttressed by additional psychological processes
- Mirror neurons, while a possible mechanism for imitation, do not fully solve the problem as they are likely found throughout the brain and do not limit information processing to a simple loop between perception and action

**Evolutionary Challenges in the Evolution of Imitative Ability**
- The evolutionary advantage of investing in neural tissue for imitative ability is limited when it is rare, as individuals carrying the mutation are handicapped by the extra energy requirements
- This creates a "Catch-22" situation: the beneficial effects of imitative ability only emerge when it is common, but it is unlikely to evolve from a single rare mutation
- The start-up cost for the complex cognitive machinery underlying imitative ability presents a significant barrier to its evolution


### Chapter Nine THE TECHNO-TANGO

**Technology Evolution: Artifacts as Phenotypes**

**Background:**
- Human minds give birth to ideas for artifacts in their minds (mental objects)
- These ideas are expressed physically through human activity (phenotypes)
- Early artifacts are independent physical objects, divorced from the vital force behind their creation

**Artifacts as Extended Phenotypes:**
- Originate in human mind as mental objects (genotype)
- Physical manifestation is the artifact itself (phenotype)
- Artifacts are extensions of memes, created through an intermediary agent, the host organism
- Early artifacts are simple and not self-replicating

**Niche Construction:**
- Making artifacts involves transforming natural resources in the environment
- Human beings reform their surroundings to survive and reproduce (ecological engineering)

**Evolution of Artifacts:**
- Ideas behind artifacts evolve, leading to new products and selection pressures
- Physical objects themselves do not evolve directly
- Characteristic production cycle: idea, product, use, selection; then new idea, new product, new round of selection.


#### Niche construction through artifact creation and memes interaction

**Niche Construction**
- Animals like ants, termites, bees construct their niche by making homes out of mud
- Worms chew up their surroundings to make it more congenial for themselves and microbes/plants
- Humans are the "niche constructors nonpareil" as we have transformed the planet through generations of powerful activity
- Niche construction creates a new evolutionary loop where the transformed environment puts selective pressures on the organisms that made those modifications
- Every new technology introduces capabilities and hazards

**Artifacts and Evolution**
- Artifacts, such as paintings and fashionable clothes, are part of our cultural environment
- Creating artifacts can significantly influence the direction of biological evolution
- Artifacts are physical objects in the environment that can be interacted with
- Making artifacts can be a "natural" consequence of genetic programs for that kind of behavior
- Skills for modifying the environment can also be transmitted through social learning (culturally learned niche construction)
- This allows individuals to acquire new abilities for making things, enabling them to respond to environmental challenges without genetic mutation

**Artifacts as Interactors**
- Artifacts are linked to memes by the fact that they must be wielded appropriately to have real force
- People with expertise make artifacts an important component of culture
- The idea of a wagon is embodied in its design, making it a "vehicle" for carrying the wagon-meme
- The wagon-meme must get out of the physical wagon and into a mind to create the next generation of wagon-memes
- Wagons can communicate the idea of motion and transportation through their form, causing the meme to leap into the perceiving mind.


#### Discussing memes, artifacts, and the role of interactors in replication processes. Artifacts are not self-replicating systems; they depend on external factors such as knowledgeable individuals or factories for creation and maintenance.

**The Recipient's Acquisition of Memetic Copies**
- The recipient acquires a memetic copy of the inventor's idea of efficient transportation via rolling wheels through perception
- Perception allows for the separation of idea from instantiation, extracting "wagonness" and reconstructing the wagon
- The meme travels from brain to artifact (wagon) and back into another's mind through a signal

**Problems with the Explanation**
1. Perception is not an active process of "magical darts" but a passive reception of signals by organisms.
2. Introduces an asymmetry in how memes enter and leave artifacts, suggesting a "magical process" for signal transformation to meme-hood.
3. Biological genotypes and artifactual "interactors" have reverse roles: biological replicators are inside organisms, while ideas for making new artifacts are outside in someone's brain.
4. Artifacts lack the ability to repair themselves or convert energy like organisms and require external assistance.
5. The mechanism for converting energy supply into useful form may not be within the artifact itself.

**Artifacts as Interactors**
- Artifacts are not independent reproductive systems but part of a larger system: knowledgeable individuals or factories producing them
- Artifacts are "zombies" controlled remotely, unlike organisms with internal replicators and catalysts.

**Simple vs Complex Artifacts**
- Simple tools are extensions of organisms and not interactors
- Machines have internal structure and can process information, making them potential interactors
- The invention of machines linked to independent power sources enabled factories and self-moving artifacts (trains)


#### Artifacts as signal templates for meme transmission. Memes exist in brains, artifacts mediate communication.

**Artifacts as Interactors and Templates for Signals**

**Artifacts as Interactors:**
- Some artifacts are like organisms: have internal differentiation, can use their own power source
- Examples: computers, wagons, rockets
- Can move under their own power and be "smart"
- Artifacts can be called "metabolic artifacts" or "interactors"
- Historical development of sophisticated artifacts
- Evolutionary process responsible for this development
- Artifacts can act as templates for signals

**Signals:**
- Patterned streams of particles flowing through a channel
- Natural: organism produces them (e.g., speech)
- Technological: machine produces them (e.g., photon stream)

**Artifacts as Templates for Signals:**
- Consolidated artifacts consist of a substrate with information inscribed on it or in them
- Examples: tattoos, paintings, books, magnetic tape, DVDs
- Artifacts can be templates for generating signals
- No need for memes inside the artifact to replicate idea

**Memes:**
- Information that passes through artifacts on its way from one mind to another
- Signals may carry memes before and after contact with artifact
- Memes learn to exploit in-place mechanism for their own replication

**The Rosetta Stone:**
- Rocks don't talk, but form a durable substrate for signal templates
- Memes reside only in brains, not in the stone itself
- Dead memes appear again in brains through indirect means (e.g., translation)


#### Artifacts as carriers of memes: Signals vs. templates for communication.

**Artifact Transmission of Memes**

**Indirect Transmission through Artifacts**:
- Stone functions as a long-term storage device for written templates
- When "read off", produces a catalytic signal to re-create the meme in a brain
- Can be as efficient as direct transmission if conditions are right

**Artifact Production Process**:
- Neuromemes can produce signals or artifacts
- Makes a choice between:
  - Producing a brain spike (social signal)
  - Producing a physical template (artifact)
- Artifact production requires coordination of complex host activity

**Delayed Replication with Artifacts**:
- Adds uncertainty to the memetic life cycle
- Delayed replication compared to direct signal transmission
- But artifacts can potentially represent an improvement in reaching more brains

**Communicative Artifacts**:
- Some artifacts are explicitly designed to serve as signal templates (communicative artifacts)
- Allows signals to reflect off the artifact, leading to meme reproduction
- Examples: Books, messages in bottles

**Adaptive Features of Communicative Artifacts**:
- Designed to facilitate message transmission
- Improvements in printing make message dissemination easier
- Successful communicative artifacts focus on efficient communication, not on communicating the artifact itself


#### The evolution of artifacts and memes: from simple templates to complex computer memory.

**Evolution of Memes and Artifacts**

**Development of Artifacts for Meme Replication:**
- First route: simple artifacts (rocks, ink on paper)
  - Encodes messages as patterned structures
  - Physical substrate used as "background"
- Second route: machines producing artifacts with signal templates (printing press, tape recorder)
  - Neuromeme produces a signal that induces host behavior to produce an artifact
  - Artifact then produces a memetic artifact with a signal template
- Advantage: Machines can create many more copies of communicative artifacts than possible without them

**Artifacts Controlling Signal Production:**
- Electronic artifacts (tape players, television sets)
  - Generate signals themselves rather than reflecting ambient radiation
- "Generation gap" between traditional templates and electronic media
- Increased control over signal content, destinations, and distribution
- Potential population of hosts increases dramatically

**Artifact-Based Signal Templates:**
- Computers as homes for sophisticated templates
  - Memories are active and flexible (can be modified)
  - Millions of bits of information can coexist in a single machine

**Coevolutionary Sequence:**
- Artifacts and memes form a symbiotic relationship
  - Increasing dependency between the two species
- Advantages for Memes:
  - Ectoparasitic templates are exposed to the environment and can be readily degraded
  - Limited message production (only transcription of template structure)
  - Forms of artifacts become increasingly complex, but sophistication of signals remains unchanged.


#### Artifacts as Replicators: Memes and Evolutionary Roles

**Artifacts as Replicators: The Evolutionary Roles of Artifacts**

**Artifact Protection and Opportunity**:
- Artifacts provide shelter from environmental forces, protecting the template within
- Artifacts offer opportunities to feed off their resources for creating more complex structures

**Computers as Artifactual Hosts**:
- Computers provide a microenvironment for templates to live in
- Computers enable the development of new code and sophisticated execution structures
- Networked computers allow for replication of programs (template states) through signal transmission

**Artifacts vs. Organic Hosts**:
- Artifacts are not biological, so the relationship is "at a distance" through templates
- Artifacts cannot adapt to the presence of parasites

**Artifact Replicators**:
- Computer viruses are an example of artifactual replicators that duplicate themselves in electronic memory
- Nanites - nano-machines that can self-assemble and potentially self-replicate - may represent true artifactual replicators

**Meme-Artifact Interaction**:
- Memes compete with nanites for control over evolution
- Interests of physical replicators and biological/cultural ones may not align

**Memes and Artifact Evolution**:
- Simple artifacts have functions that directly follow their form, like prions
- More complex machines can embody multiple ideas (memes)
- Artifacts can evolve by developing component parts with independent functions
- Templates can contain information that must be interpreted to have meaning


#### Coevolution of Memes and Artifacts: A Darwinian Perspective on Technology

**Coevolution of Memes and Artifacts**

**Communicative Artifacts**:
- Material object becomes secondary, serves as a good support for the template
- Doesn't matter if words are written on stone, paper, or computer screen
- Development of more sophisticated artifacts like nanites does not make simple phenotypic artifacts obsolete

**Phenotype to Replicator Transition**:
- Prions: replicating proteins that acquire ability to replicate through physical modification of shape
- Become independent replicators, transforming from genetic phenotypes
- Carbon 60 (buckyball) molecules can self-assemble into aggregates with regularized shapes
- Potentially become replicators themselves

**Artifact Design Modification**:
- User notices faulty aspect of tool and attempts to improve it
- Can involve changes in behavior or design modification
- Process of artifact mutation can be Darwinian, involving selection among random mutations

**Technological Change as Darwinian Process**:
- New artifact types created through invention (random mutations)
- Innovations are modifications of inventions through recombination of parts
- Cumulative selection leads to adaptive design with greater power to transform environment
- Parallel evolution in technical knowledge base and in artifacts themselves

**Interaction of Memes and Artifacts**:
- Coevolution between memes and artifacts, especially communicative artifacts
- Aspects of an artifact may be produced through replication of a meme
- Other aspects may be non-memetic in nature
- Creates coevolutionary relationship between artifacts and ideas


#### Parallels between memes and artifacts in cultural evolution: Interactions and coevolution.

**The Interaction between Mimes and Artifacts: A Complex Relationship**

**Two Darwinian Processes**
- Evolution in memes and artifacts work together to achieve cultural change

**Coevolutionary Dynamics**
- Both memes and artifacts have independent evolutionary dynamics
- Coevolutionary relationships between them due to their mutual involvement

**Types of Artifacts: Simple Phenotypes, Interactors, or Replicators?**
- Different models needed to understand varying kinds of relationships between memes and artifacts

**Symbiotic Relationship**
- What benefits hosts also aids memes as mental parasites
- Overlapping expectations between standard social science and memetic approach

**Conflict Between Memes and Artifacts**
- Potential for conflict arises when memes and artifacts become replicators themselves
- Who controls technological evolution?

**Memes and Artifacts in Human Culture**
- Memes began as replicators, advanced through interactions with signals and artifacts
- Artifacts rapidly evolved from simple phenotypes to replicators due to their involvement with ideas

**Implications for Our Notion of Culture**
- Current definition of culture as information in individuals' heads is too narrow
- Suggestion: Replace "ideas in people's heads" with a broader concept that includes artifacts and their evolution.


#### Cultural evolution and the role of social learning and human imitation.

**Defining Culture: The Overlap Between Social Learning and Technology**

**Cultural Consensualists vs. Social Learning**:
- Cultural consensualists argue that cultural beliefs result from shared experiences, not just social transmission
- This breaks the link between culture and society, which most social scientists want to keep

**Culture as Acquired Through Social Living**:
- The true criterion of what is cultural is how such information is acquired: through **social learning**, rather than genetic or mental inheritance
- Culture is something individuals acquire during their life spans through **social living**

**Cognition and Technology**:
- You can't really separate the production of communicative artifacts on the factory floor from their role in the dissemination of information
- The state of communication technology determines what artifacts can do as manipulators and purveyors of information
- Artifacts are intermediaries; the routes of information circulation involve many interchanges between people and artifacts

**Recognizing the Environmental Aspect of Culture**:
- Much of non-genetic information is stored in various kinds of artifacts in the environment, reasserting the uniqueness of human species
- The "cultural adaptation" that separated humanity from other creatures has diminished with the discovery of cultural traditions in animals

**Cumulative Culture as a Distinguishing Factor**:
- What distinguishes humans is **cumulative culture**, where cultural advances are built upon each other to reach more sophisticated levels
- The key mechanism driving this ratchet effect is the human ability to understand others as intentional agents and truly imitate them


#### Cultural complexity emerges from the interaction of genes, memes, and artifacts.

**Cultural Learning vs. Social Learning**

**Reliability of Information Transmission**:
- Socially transmitted information can be reliable due to learners ignoring errors made by teachers
- This allows for cultural learning (exclusive to humans) and social learning (observational learning in animals like chimpanzees)

**Apes' Ability to Imitate**:
- Apes cannot directly transmit action patterns or strategies through observation
- They can learn what things to pay attention to and draw their own inferences about how to use that knowledge

**Cumulative Culture and Artifacts**:
- **Culture has a body as well as a mind**, made up of artifacts like metal and plastic
- The ability to manufacture and share artifacts may be the real cause of cumulative culture
- Humans are increasingly dependent on their constructed environment

**Memes, Artifacts, and Cognition**:
- Genes, memes (information units), and artifacts create a complex life-form similar to symbiotic relationships
- Cognition can be offloaded into the environment, providing advantages like public accessibility and long-term durability

**Differences Between Humans and Apes**:
- Apes have the physical abilities (hands, brains) but lack the necessary artifacts for cumulative culture
- This deficit may be due to a psychological inability to indicate each other's behavior or engage in complex planning

**Conclusion**:
- Cumulative culture is not necessarily dependent on big brains alone, but rather on the ability to produce and share complex artifacts.


### Chapter Ten RETHINKING REPLICATION

**Replication: Insights from Non-Genetic Replicators**

**Repetition and Precise Conditions**:
- Nature can only achieve permanence through replication of material things
- Many precise conditions are involved in the replication of physical things
- All replicators are material things

**Defining Similarity and the Same Influence Rule**:
- Crucial to determining which replicators belong together
- Satisfied if two replicators have the same job with similar overall consequences
- Identifies a class of replicators that share physical form and role

**Physical Instantiation of Replicators**:
- Some aspects are irrelevant to their evolutionary roles
- Examples: Genes with non-coding regions, fragmented computer virus programs
- Same Influence Rule applies

**Super-Parasitic Replicators**:
- Cannot replicate on their own and rely on existing machinery
- Examples: Prions, computer viruses, memes
- Engage in third-order replication to grow populations
- Use conversion of substrates as primary mechanism for replication

**Causally Distinct Avenues of Replication**:
- Mutation (file corruption)
- Transmission through protected channels
- "Natural" bias (structural tendency to adopt relevant conformation)


#### Super-parasitic replicators: memes, genes, and computer viruses and their evolutionary dynamics.

**Parasitic Replicators: Memes**

**Definition:**
- Memes are a form of super-parasitic replicator, similar to viruses and prions
- Depend on biological substrate provided by genes
- Use signals as intermediaries for replication

**Evolution:**
- Three major phases: simple reproductive cycles to more complicated ones
- Began replicating within single hosts, then developed ability to distribute among hosts
- Mechanisms for jumping the gap between hosts are different from viruses

**Reproduction:**
- Replicate at linear rates (Malthusian replicators)
- Use inter-neuronal and inter-personal signals as instigators
- Can undergo selection, with fit variants surviving over time

**Comparison to Computer Viruses:**
- Both use electrochemical terms for definition
- Primary difference lies in the biological vs. artifactual substrate
- Similar evolutionary developments: three major phases and complex life cycles.

**Implications:**
- Memes have immense implications for understanding cultural evolution
- Parasitic replicators are forces to be reckoned with in modern world
- Distinction between super-molecular and other super-parasites.


#### Replication and evolution: Biological vs. cultural distinctions through signals.

**Replication of Super-Molecular Replicators**

**Development of Signal-Mediated Replication:**
- Evolution of replicators from simple to sophisticated mechanisms
- Use of signals for mediation of replication
- Loosening constraints on physical conformations
- Flexibility in substrates a replicator can adopt
- Relationship between super-molecular replicators and signal-mediated replication

**Characteristics of Signal-Mediated Replication:**
- Information transfer through signals instead of direct contact
- Loss of physical connection between source and copy
- Useful to think about replication reactions as physical events in space and time
- Energy input required for reaction, producing a second instance of the replicator

**Biological vs Cultural Replication:**
- Distinction between biological and cultural replication
- Physical overlap is not a clear divider
- Material contact but no material overlap (e.g., prions) does not exclude biological nature
- Signals as mediators distinguish cultural from biological replication
- Biology relies on communication for facilitation, but signals are not central to the replication process
- Cultural replication always involves code-switching and multiple steps in inheritance.


### Chapter Eleven THE REVOLUTION OF MEMES

**Chapter Eleven: The Revolution of Memes**

**Culture and Human Evolution:**
- Culture not inherited genetically, acquired through learning from others
- Genes have given way to culture as primary driver of human evolution

**Early Understanding of Genes:**
- No consensus on nature of genes before 1950s
- Identification of physical genes a scientific revolution

**Molecular Memetics:**
- Needed to establish memetics as a science
- Similarities in cultural traits over time explained by memes

**The Nature of Memes:**
- Hidden in the brain, not artifacts or behaviors
- Brain's isolated, energy-rich environment an ideal place for memes

**Electric Memes:**
- Suggestion that memes are electric entities in the brain
- Electric charge: stream of electrons and ion movements

**Memetic Replicators:**
- Rapidly replicating states within neuronal networks
- States determine node's electrochemical propensity to fire action potentials

**Memes' Evolutionary Stages:**
- First evolved within brains
- Non-memetic information processing: network flexes and distorts as state changes location
- Replication within a brain: signals stimulate one node, causing another to acquire the same configuration
- Memes become infectious: copies can be "caught" by other nodes in the network.


#### Neuromemes and social memetics: evolution of parasitic ideas in the brain and beyond.

**Memetic Evolution: From Neuromemes to Social Memetics**

**Neuromemes**:
- Copy of a state that might not be functional ("junk meme")
- Substrate for replication is the physical network of neurons (neuropil)
- Replicator is an electrochemical potential in a neuron or set of neurons
- Node's state measured by sensitivities to incoming stimuli
- Effective network: linked neurons likely to fire simultaneously

**Social Memetics**:
- Signals are perturbations that propagate information between brains
- Memes replicate between brains through social interaction and behavior
- New copies of meme formed in both brains
- Evolution independent of host organism

**Memetic Perspective**:
- Brain is a "new kind of spherical 'planet' on which an ecology of replicators can evolve"
- Memes are parasites that evolved from neuromemes
- Memes cannot be equated with the mind or self, as they are just one aspect of brain function

**Artifacts and Signals**:
- Artifacts: static substrates for signals (e.g., computer memory)
- Signals: dynamic information carriers (neural or social)
- Memes involve artifacts through construction or use in signal production
- Coevolutionary process between memes, artifacts, and organisms drives cultural change.


#### Neuromemetics: Understanding Memes as Replicators from Biology to Sociocultural Phenomena

**Neuromimetics: Understanding Meme Evolution**

**Overview:**
- Neuromimetics is a theory that explains meme evolution through three phases - neurometric, social, and coevolutionary.
- This approach connects advances in biological and neurological sciences to the explanation of social phenomena.

**Three Phases of Meme Evolution:**
1. **Neuromimetics (First Phase)**:
   - Information transfer is based on signal production between neurons within organisms.
   - Replication is mediated by signals within organisms.

2. **Social Memetics (Second Phase)**:
   - Signal-mediated replication occurs between organisms.
   - Memes evolve through social transmission and imitation.

3. **Coevolutionary Mimetics (Third Phase)**:
   - Information transfer becomes more indirect with artifact and signal mediation.
   - Memes inspire behaviors that produce or modify signals, leading to replication between organisms.

**Benefits of Neuromimetics:**
- Provides a naturalistic theory of communication and culture.
- Ensures continuity with results from biological and physical sciences.
- Allows social science to build upon discoveries in these fields.

**Memes as Replicators:**
- Memes are defined as replicators that evolve through descent with modification.
- They operate at the intercellular level within an organism rather than between organisms.
- Neuromimetics recognizes the psychological aspect of meme evolution and history.

**Unification of Sciences:**
- Replicators can potentially unify sciences by connecting physics, chemistry, biology, and social sciences through their generating process.
- Each replicator builds on previous ones, leading to new sciences that study their products at different scales of organization.
