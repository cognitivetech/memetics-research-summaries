# Luke Burgis Wanting The Power Of Mimetic Desire In Everyday Life 2021

> A groundbreaking exploration of why we want what we want, and a toolkit for freeing ourselves from chasing unfulfilling desires. Gravity affects every aspect of our physical being, but there’s a psychological force just as powerful - yet almost nobody has heard of it. It’s responsible for bringing groups of people together and pulling them apart, making certain goals attractive to some and not to others, and fueling cycles of anxiety and conflict. In Wanting, Luke Burgis draws on the work of French polymath René Girard to bring this hidden force to light and reveals how it shapes our lives and societies. According to Girard, humans don’t desire anything independently. Human desire is mimetic - we imitate what other people want. This affects the way we choose partners, friends, careers, clothes, and vacation destinations. Mimetic desire is responsible for the formation of our very identities. It explains the enduring relevancy of Shakespeare’s plays, why Peter Thiel decided to be the first investor in Facebook, and why our world is growing more divided as it becomes more connected. - [Luke Burgis_Wanting_The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life 2021](https://www.amazon.com/Wanting-Power-Mimetic-Desire-Everyday/dp/B08KGVLHVX?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

### Exploring desire and its connections to human interaction through the concept of Bodies without Organs (BwO)

**Girard's Insight into Desire and Objects**

**Desire vs. Reality**
- Denying truth: people come up with reasons to justify their desires instead of facing reality (e.g., a farmer not showing his wife the potential inability to make a living from farming)
- Persistent objects of desire create constant tension within oneself
- Objects of desire are internal, not external

**The Human Unconscious**
- Desire and need intertwined: both have equal importance
- Understanding inner needs helps resolve persistent desires
- Inner resolution is essential for change

**Choosing Objects of Desire**
- People choose objects of desire unconsciously
- Objects reveal our internal needs and desires
- Conscious acknowledgement of these desires can lead to understanding themselves better.

**The Nature of Desire and Objects**
- Desires are constant, not easily satisfied: a continuous cycle (e.g., wanting more food when already full)
- Desires create tension that needs resolution
- Satisfaction is temporary and leads to further desire.

**Inner Conflict**
- Internal conflict between desires arises from the inability to prioritize or balance them out (e.g., work vs. family)
- Inner resolution required for lasting peace
- Understanding our deeper needs can help resolve internal conflicts.

**The Human Connection to Desires and Objects**
- Desiring objects is part of being human, a form of communication and artistry
- Sharing experiences related to desires builds connections between people (e.g., artists expressing their inner feelings through art)
- Understanding the reasoning behind our desires can lead to deeper empathy towards others.


### Exploring the depths of desire through the concept of bodies without organs (BwO) in literature and human connections.

**The Gravity of Desire**

**Modes of Expression**:
- People engage in secret admiration for things they desire
- This can manifest as art, music, or writing
- It is a way to express the intangible and emotional aspect of desires

**Girard's Analysis**:
- Girard analyzed the role of mimetic desire in human behavior
- He argued that desire drives people to emulate each other, leading to conflict
- This can be seen in literature, mythology, and art

**Examples of Mimetic Desire**:
- Profiles of famous figures like Shakespeare, Marilyn Monroe, and McCullough
- Their inability to contain their desire led them to imitate others
- This resulted in groundbreaking works that reflected this mimetic impulse

**Girard's Ideas Challenged the Establishment**:
- Girard's ideas challenged established notions of individual achievement and creativity
- He argued that these were often a result of mimetic desire, rather than innate talent
- This sparked controversy and debate in academic circles

**Mimetic Desire Across Disciplines**:
- Mimetic desire can be seen across various disciplines and fields
- From ancient mythology to modern art, literature, and philosophy
- It is a pervasive force that shapes human behavior and expression


### Biography of Gerard Brangwyn: Life, Art, and the Exploration of Mimetics and Desire.

**Girard's Life and Influence**

**Early Life**:

- Criticized the idea that animals could not fully comprehend human emotions
- Believed that animals' self-sufficiency was powerful and influential

**Key Quotes**:
- "What has frightened you really is your own self, in a form that you have denied." (on understanding the self)
- "There was a lot of resistance - a doctor's resistance to being irreversible, a doctor's resistance to being involved in a real dilemma." (on confronting the reality of situations)
- "The intellectual transformation was quite quick, but it didn't solve everything. It took me a while to digest it in my very being." (on the impact of new ideas)

**Impact**:
- Influenced thinking in psychoanalysis, religion, and civility through his work
- Contributed to the fields of psychiatry and psychology with his insights


### Exploring the power of desires and connections in human behavior through the concept of Masses of Desire from "The Society of the Spectacle" by Guy Debord.

**Competitive Relationships:**
- **Importance of clear communication**: When people are valuated based on their performance for others, they are forced to be themselves and resist being molded into someone else's vision or consensus. This leads to intense debates about differences in beliefs and intentions.
- **Equality is essential**: Sameness is not necessary; individuals should be respected for their unique perspectives.
- **Fighting for self-expression**: People are compelled to fight for the acceptance of their own thoughts, feelings, and desires, rather than conforming to others' expectations.

**Influence of Art:**
- **Homogenizing influence**: Cultures come together through art, fostering an understanding and appreciation of differences in thought and expression.
- **Major figures in various arts**: e.g., Cainan, Abel, Ismail, Ishmael, Esaau and Jacob, Joseph Merrick, Shakespeare, Isaac Asimov, Carl Jung, Edgar Allan Poe.

**Human Nature:**
- **Inner conflict**: Individuals must learn to embrace their own desires in the face of external pressures that push for conformity.
- **Importance of self-expression**: It is crucial to fight for the preservation of individuality, even if it means defying societal norms or expectations.

**Conclusion:**
- **Embrace differences**: Respect and celebrate uniqueness instead of striving towards uniformity in thought and expression.

## Part I The Power of Mimetic Desire

Desire's Body without Organs: Distinguishing valid desire from fascist or suicidal impulses on the plane of consistency.

The Body without Organs (BwO) is the essence of desire. It represents our deepest desires and drives, encompassing physical, biological, psychic, social, and cosmic aspects. The material challenge for schizoanalysis lies in recognizing authentic BwO from its problematic manifestations, such as cancerous bodies or empty vitreous bodies.

The test for desire: distinguishing between destructive or violent tendencies and those that contribute to constructing the plane of consistency. The plane is a collective totality of validated BwOs, not including their negative counterparts.

Understanding the nature of this totality: logical or real? Can all effects be achieved on the plane without actual substance use or drugs? An abstract machine is required to create continuity among desires and maintain connections, preventing emptied or cancerous doubles from dominating.


### 1. Hidden ModelsRomantic Lies Infant Truth

**Hidden Models of Romanities: Infant Truth, Cesare's Self-Decision... Love by Another's Eyes**

**Romantic Illusions vs. Reality:**
- People want what they cannot have (Cesare's self-decision)
- Loving someone for their appearance instead of true essence
- Misinterpreting intentions, objective qualities, or desires
  - Desire is driven by a need to fill the void in one's own life
  - Mistaken motives: deceive others or reveal true self
    * Inner desire vs. outer appearance

**Symbolism:**
- Fruit symbolizes growth and development (Greek mythology)
- Representation of inner turmoil within oneself
- Frustration arises from the inability to reconcile inner contradictions

**Importance of Persistence:**
- Instantaneously realizing that something is not for us
- Accepting and acknowledging emotions without judgment
  - Embrace the lesson, not the pain itself.

**The Role of Others:**
- Peer pressure to conform to societal norms (Bible's Cant)
- Misinterpretation of others' intentions leading to confusion or conflict
  - Persistence in understanding one's own truth instead of others' perceptions

**Embracing Truth:**
- Contradictions within oneself can be reconciled through introspection and self-acceptance
- Understanding that love is about growth, not superficial appearances or abilities.


#### Secrets Babies Keep

**Babies' Humanity: The Beauty of Babies**

**The Babysitter's Observations**:
- Babies mimic many different sounds
- They are capable of imitating various emotional expressions
- Babies are observant and can pick up on others' voices, faces, and intentions

**Melzoff and Moore's Research**:
- Conducted research in 1977 with infant's interest in learning and brain science
- Studied the development of imitative behavior in babies
- Found that infants are interested in other people's eyes, faces, intentions, and emotions

**The Power of Imitation**:
- Babies have the ability to imitate and learn from others
- This development allows them to socialize and connect with others
- Infants can understand complex emotional states through imitation and attention

**Melzoff and Moore's Findings**:
- Babies imitate gestures, facial expressions, and vocalizations of adults
- Imitation helps babies learn and develop various skills, including language and social interaction
- Observations showed that infants are attentive to others' emotional states and intentions

**The Importance of Imitation**:
- Infants' imitative behavior is crucial for their development
- It allows them to understand and interact with the world around them
- Imitation helps babies learn complex behaviors, such as language and social skills

**Additional Research by Melzoff and Moore**:
- Conducted research in 2007 and 2009 with René Girard's art
- Studied how infants react to art and understand the intentions behind it
- Found that infants can grasp complex emotional states through imitation and attention

**The Power of Attention**:
- Babies are attentive to others' expressions, gestures, and vocalizations
- This attention allows them to learn and develop various skills, such as language and social interaction
- Infant's ability to focus on others is essential for their development and understanding of the world.


##### Exploring desire and interconnectedness through the perspectives of Melanie Klein and Mirror Neurons.

**Melzoflax's Explanation of Infant-Mother Bonding:**
* A mother looks at her baby as a sign that her desire for the object is strongest
* The baby takes this as a signal to start interacting, leading to an infant's mind developing in response to the mother
* This process is shown through the Romanantic Ideal (MEG) - a concept introduced by Mirror Neurons in the 1990s. It suggests that an infant's brain activity reflects the actions of others, allowing for emotional connection and imitation.

**Melzoflax's Observation of Infant-Mother Bonding:**
* Mothers exhibit a strong desire to interact with their babies (Mirror Neurons)
* Babies respond by picking up on this desire and reflect it back, creating a reciprocal bond between them.

**The Importance of Mother's Role in Infant Development:**
* A mother's brain activity influences her infant's development through the Romanantic Ideal (MEG)
* This allows for emotional connection and imitation to occur between the two
* The process is compared to a mirror, with both parties reflecting each other's actions and desires.

**Misconceptions About Infant-Mother Bonding:**
* Mirror Neurons were discovered in the 1990s by Italian scientists, who observed that infants' brain activity reflected their mother's actions and desires.
* This led to the concept of the Romanantic Ideal (MEG), which explains how emotional connection and imitation develop between a mother and her infant.
* However, the exact mechanism behind this process is still not fully understood by researchers.

#### Two Kinds of Models

**Imitiation of Others' Desires vs. Acceptance of Differences**

**Observing Others**:
- People seem to express desires and needs through mimicked facial expressions, even subtly
- This is a form of social connection for understanding and relating to others

**Mimicking vs. Acceptance**:

- Accepting differences allows for true expression and connection on an deeper level

**Examples of Imitation**:

- **Fictional Characters**: Characters in books, movies, or art can inspire a sense of connection through shared experiences

**The Nature of Differences**:
- Differences between individuals can lead to conflict, but also to understanding and growth
- Accepting these differences allows for the "cathartic" release of tension and the ability to coexist peacefully

**Imitiation vs. Inclusivity**:
- **Mimicking** can be a way to include others, but it doesn't truly address the root cause of differences
- **Acceptance and inclusion** allows for true connection and understanding


#### Celebristan

**Celestial Influence on Human Behavior:**
* People are affected by those around them, either positively or negatively

	+ Can't be physically present everywhere at once
* Societal pressures may impede acceptance of celestial ideas
	+ Fear or resistance from peers can deter individuals from embracing new beliefs
* Practical challenges, such as lack of resources or skepticism, hinder the spread of celestial influence.

**Inspiration and Commitment:**
* Inspiration comes from observing others' genuine commitment to their beliefs
	+ Witnessing how they live out their convictions
* True commitment requires both faith and action
	+ Example: Saint Francis' dedication to poverty inspired others
* Emotion plays a significant role in inspiring change within individuals.

#### Distortion 3 Reflexivity

**The Taste of Saints**

**Experts vs. Experts**:
- Expertise is presented as a form of resistance to reality
- It's not about being more knowledgeable, but about persistence and conviction in one's opinion
- The "mime" of an expert can be seen as a craving for freedom and avoidance of external pressures

**Example: The British Pound Incident (1992)**:

	+ External barriers: societal norms, expectations, and reactions from others
* When someone is ready to express their true desires, they may exhibit signs of distress beforehand, such as fidgeting or difficulty concentrating. This can be an indication that they are about to reveal something important.
* People often use nonverbal communication (e.g., body language, tone of voice) to convey hidden messages or emotions related to their desires.
* Desire can also manifest in the form of art, writing, music, or other creative outlets when individuals may not feel comfortable expressing themselves directly.

- Revealed that the cats represent a need for connection between humans and animals, as well as addressing the cynicism within society

**Egyptian Artist's Revelation**:
- Cats symbolize vulnerability in human interaction
- E gyptians used to depict cats in art to convey love and sacrifice
- The truthing of ory represents the need for emotional connection and understanding
- Sacred rites - such as fertility, grief, and death - are essential in this process

**Sacred Rites**:
- Cats represent a need for human connection and addressing societal cynicism
- The Down Town Project was criticized but ultimately conveys the importance of these sacred rites
- These rituals involve acknowledging emotions, such as grief or fear, in order to move forward

**Critics' Perspective**:

#### Sacred Violence

**The Invention of Blame: Social Discovery**

**Danager of Purity vs Safety in Judgment**:
- Jon Lanier's computations on New York City's Times Square
- Spectator's statements: "Infamy or Yield"
  - Protect me from what I want, rather than what I need
  - Demanding a connection between mental desire and physical reality
- People everywhere are exposed to a contest of vitality that reveals the inability to tend to our own needs

**Von Clausewitz's Militarization of Metaphysics**:
- Prussian general von Clauswitz: "What is war?"
  - Not just fighting on a military battlefield, but also moral and political battles
  - Conflict arises when one side admits to a deficit in their own position or needs

**The Calculation of Misery**:
- People within communities can create an end, such as war, that requires both sides to be involved
- The question is how this conflict could have been prevented if all parties admitted to their own shortcomings


#### The Danger of Purity

**Effect of Preventing Morbidity: Scape Goat Mechanism**

**Scape Goat Mechanism**:
- Occurs when people drive the "scapegoat" (i.e., a person or group) to the edge of their community, blaming them for their own misfortunes
- Example: Greek story of Aristoteles and the pharmaakos (a sacred scapegoat)
  - Pharmaakos represented the people's fears and troubles
  - The people would crowd around it, forcing it to the edge of the community
  - This collective act symbolized how everyone is responsible for their own miseries

**Ari's Story**:
- Involved a painting by Aristoteles depicting a scapegoat (a goat) being led to the edge of the community
- The painting was interpreted as a commentary on the collective responsibility of the community in dealing with their own problems
- The people, unwilling to take responsibility, blamed the scapegoat for their miseries

**Collective Act**:
- The people would crowd around the pharmaakos, forcing it closer to the edge of the community
- This act symbolized how everyone is responsible for their own misfortunes

**Impact on Community**:
- The scapegoat mechanism allowed the community to collectively release their tensions and anxieties onto one individual or group
- This prevented individuals from taking responsibility for their own actions and contributions to the problem

**Symbolic Meaning**:
- The pharmaakos represented the people's fears and troubles, allowing them to be externalized and projected onto an object (the goat)
- This allowed the community to avoid introspection and reflection on their own roles in creating or perpetuating the problem


#### Saving People from Themselves

**Waters of Nostalgia**

**The Price of Memories**:
- People in a crowd are like a community, playing a game of trust
- They put their trust in each other, both in play and in fight
- Each person is only a small part of the larger system
- Nobody suspects that their deep intentions are different from the group's purpose

**The Illusion of Unity**:
- Nothing is more subtle than the human heart
- Justice is not always evident, even when it is demanded with passion
- The crowd is deceived by the tyranny of the strong
- The chimpanzee knows that the chimpanzee would become bitter if it were denied a place in the group

**The Illusion of Perfection**:
- Nothing is more important than the collective intelligence of the group
- Individuals are unable to stand alone, and must work together to accomplish anything
- They are oppressed by fear and indecision
- Nothing has fully convinced them to take action

**Unseen Forces**:
- The crowd is united not only by their bodies but also by their feelings
- Fear and indecision render them impotent
- They are unable to confront the reality of their situation
- Their own weaknesses and biases cloud their judgment


##### This text explores the concept of "horrible monsters" and their transformative power through the story of Apollonius of Tyana and the Ephésians. It delves into the idea of veiled social dynamics, interpersonal connections, and the role of violence in reshaping individuals' perceptions.

**He Has No Idea What's Appened**

**Smiling and Nodding**:
- With a cold beer in each hand, he's smiling and nodding, appearing to be deep in thought

- The Ephians were initially reluctant, but eventually yielded
- Pollonius demonstrated his power by making the Ephians perform a strange ritual
- They filled a place with sand and showed their willingness to be blinded by his rock of faith

**The Transformation Within**:
- The Ephians' transformation symbolizes the internal conflict in their minds about Pollonius's teachings
- They ultimately embrace Pollonius's message, giving him the power he had demanded
- Pollonius provided a pharmakos - an offering of atonement and expiation


##### Pool party dynamics, Crowd behavior, Emotional connections, Human interaction, Masochistic release, Violence and reconciliation.

**Human Interactions at the Swimming Pool**

**Crowd Psychology**:
- People form groups and stick together
- They show solidarity, like a pack mentality
- They resist individuality and admit they are just following instincts

**Behavior at the Pool**:
- A man tries to conceal his distress while swimming in the pool
- He is mocked for being vulnerable or showing emotion
- The group encourages the man to "toughen up" and hide his feelings

**Crowd Reactions**:
- People can be aggressive towards those who don't conform to the group's norms
- They may ostracize individuals who express vulnerability or emotions

**Group Pressure**:

  - Committing patricide and marrying his mother were expressions of this

**Bringing it Together**
- The man's death triggered a transformation in all the leaves, representing the plague that swept through the city
- Odile's internal struggle and guilt were reflected in both the physical and metaphorical crises
- Looking deeper into the matter revealed the complexity of the relationships and motivations involved.


#### The Dancing Mania of 1518

**Impact of Dancing and Expression**
- People use dance to express emotions: love, fear, transformation, desire, etc. (Martin's work)
- Dance can be a release for repressed feelings and emotions in individuals
- Tarrantism: a form of religious ritual allowing people to come together and express themselves through dance

**Challenges with Understanding Tarrantism**
- Criticized as primitive or childlike by some within the community
- Misunderstood due to its abstract nature and lack of explanation
- Opposition from those who view it as a regression from reality

**The Power of Dance in Healing**
- Helps individuals connect with their minds and release emotions (demonstrated through Tarrantism)
- Allows for the exploration of deep feelings that may be difficult to express verbally
- Creates an environment where people can come together and understand one another better.

**Benefits of Dance as a Form of Expression**
- Can lead to personal growth and development
- Helps individuals process emotions in a healthy way
- Provides a space for individuals to connect with each other on a deeper level.


#### Safety in Judgment

**Scapegoat Theory and Judgment**

**Scapegoat Theory**:
- Scapegoats are chosen to represent certain pressures or problems
- They serve as a symbolic representation of these issues, rather than being the actual cause
- This allows individuals to divert blame from themselves and project it onto an external entity

**Examples**:
- Paladin: A warrior who represents the need for violence and aggression in society
- The Ephians: Representatives of a civilized society that is opposed to the barbaric nature of the Scapegoat

**Consequences of Scapegoating**:
- The Scapegoat is forced to bear the sins and transgressions of others
- This can lead to the Scapegoat being ostracized, marginalized, or even killed
- This process serves to maintain the status quo by shifting blame away from those who are truly responsible

**The Throwing of Stones**:
- The act of stoning the Scapegoat represents a collective release of societal tension
- It allows individuals to symbolically "release" their own internal conflicts and aggressions
- This can provide a sense of catharsis and relief, but also serves to reinforce existing power dynamics


#### The Joy of Hate Watching

**Anger and Prejudices Unveiled**

**Research on Weibo's Popular Mediation of American Watergate Scandal (2013-2014)**

**Findings**:
- Anger presents itself in various ways: joy, be cause, a reimplication of what people think, and denial or irritability.
- People cannot see others' perspectives; they can only acknowledge their own.
  - Trump is seen as a narcissistic figure who refuses to admit faults or consider opposing viewpoints.
  - The event brings up past resentments and animosity towards politicians, realities, literature, and universality.
- In group settings, individuals may engage in gossiping, analysis, and criticism of Trump's behavior.

**Analyses**:
1. **Catharsis**: People need to express their emotions through storytelling or acting out repressed feelings.
2. **Scapegoating**: Trump is scapegoated as the cause of various issues; he embodies a figure that represents failure in many aspects.
3. **Substitution**: People substitute human ingenuity for mechanical processes, such as signing petitions or making donations, to vent their frustration.
4. **Reification**: The symbolic representation of power and authority through the metaphorical "kick me" sign becomes literal in the context of the scenario.
5. **Reverse Roles**: Just as children may act out roles reversal games, individuals in this situation swap roles between bully and victim to express their emotions.

**Significance**: The Weibo social media platform allowed people to come together and release pent-up feelings towards Trump's actions, ultimately leading to a catharsis effect for many involved.


#### The Scapegoat Wins

**The Role of Ascape Goat: Resolving Conflict**

**Community Bonding**:
- A group comes together to help each other solve problems
- They gather to support one another through adversity
- Example: The "Waiting for the Barbarians" poem by C.P. Cavafy

**Caiaphas' Perspective**:
- Caiaphas held a secret meeting with religious leaders and council members
- He recognized that Jesus presented a threat to their peace and unity
- He saw it as necessary to accuse Jesus of blasphemy to rid themselves of this disturbance

**Caiaphas' Rationale**:
- Caiaphas argued that the "ruthless" pragmatism of religious rituals was more beneficial than allowing Jesus' message of peace to spread
- He believed people were used to following established practices and would reject the new ideas presented by Jesus

**Humanity's Perspective**:
- Humanity often resists change, preferring the familiar over the new or different
- We are inclined to criticize those who challenge our beliefs and ways of life

**The Role of Scapegoating**:
- Caiaphas saw Jesus as a threat to the established order and needed to eliminate him
- He used a "sacred" form of accusation (blasphemy) against Jesus to justify his execution
- This act served as a scapegoat, allowing the group to maintain their cohesion and unity


##### Analysis of Girard's view on the Scapegoat Mechanism and Desire in Joseph's Story from the Bible.

**Girard's View: Scapegoating in Jewish and Christian Scripture**

**Scapegoating in the Book of Exodus:**
- Tenth Commandment forbids coveting one another's property or wives (Exodus 20:17)
- The story of Jotham, son of Job, and Benjamin
	+ Jotham urges his brothers to pay attention to their father's instructions
	+ Benjamin refuses, leading to a conflict between Jotham and Benjamin
	+ Jotham accuses Benjamin of wrongdoing, leading the community to make Benjamin an outcast
- The story illustrates the human tendency to identify with one side over another in conflicts

**The Book of Genesis:**
- Girard reads the scapegoating motif in Genesis as a primal rite
	+ A radical discontinuity between human beings and animals
	+ Humans attempt to bridge this gap through violent acts, such as sacrificing animals

**Girard's Interpretation:**
- Jotham's story represents the human capacity for scapegoating
	+ The community unites against a single individual (Benjamin)
	+ This unity is based on their shared fear and hatred of the outsider

**Significance:**
- The story reveals how humans create divisions between "us" and "them"
	+ Scapegoating allows for the maintenance of social order through exclusion and violence
	+ This dynamic can be seen throughout Jewish and Christian scripture, as well as in society at large.

### Moving Goalposts

**Chapter 5: Antimimeetic Feeding the People, Not the System's Desire**

**Questions Raised by the Text:**
- What does it mean to "wish away" our desires (such as wanting to lose weight)?
- Can we truly be free from our emotions and only focus on logic?
- How do we balance our own wants with societal expectations?

**Analyses of Sebaistien Brasas's Perspective:**
1. **Goals vs. Reality**: Sebaistien Brasas argues against the idea that people should make their goals align with society's demands, like getting a good education or career advancement. Instead, he emphasizes that individuals should follow their own desires, even if they don't seem practical or rational to others.
2. **The Burden of Society**: He uses an example of someone wanting to quit their job as a way to explore this idea further. The person in question may face criticism for not conforming to societal expectations, but eventually realizes that following their own desires is more important than pleasing others.
3. **Emotions vs. Logic**: Brasas explores the dichotomy between emotions and logic, arguing that emotions should not be suppressed but rather embraced in decision making. He suggests that emotional intelligence is just as valid as logical reasoning when it comes to making choices.
4. **Freedom from Conformity**: The text encourages readers to question societal norms and expectations, especially if they don't resonate with our personal desires or values. By embracing the irrationality of emotions, we can live more authentic lives and be true to ourselves.
5. **The Nature of Desire**: Ultimately, the text highlights how deeply intertwined our desires are with our sense of self. Embracing these desires, even if they seem contradictory or illogical, allows us to live a fuller existence and express our unique identity.

### 6. Disruptive EmpathyBreaking Through Thin Desires

**Disruptive Empathy: Breaking Through Thick Desires**

**The Dancer's Perspective**:
- Marcelle Prost, a dancer, described her experiences with other performers
- She felt disconnected from the group, as if they were more interested in their own needs and performances than connecting with each other
- One performer, Dave Romero (a mime artist), had an unusual way of engaging with the audience
	+ He would use simple movements to convey deep emotions, making the audience question what they were seeing
	+ The dancers found this confusing, as they were not accustomed to such non-traditional expression

**The Director's Perspective**:
- The director, Ish, had a different perspective on the situation
- He saw that the performers were so focused on their own needs and performances that they missed the opportunity to truly connect with each other and the audience
- Ish felt that Dave Romero's unique approach was exactly what was needed to wake the group up and make them more receptive to each other's perspectives

**The Mime's Perspective**:
- Dave Romero explained his motivation for his unconventional performance style
	+ He had noticed that the group's traditional, flashy movements were losing their impact on the audience
	+ He wanted to show the performers and the audience that dance could convey deep emotions without relying on spectacle
	+ He also felt a personal need to express himself in his own way, rather than simply following the group's conventions

**The Group's Reaction**:
- The other performers were initially confused by Dave Romero's approach
- They saw it as an obstacle to their own performances and did not understand how it could help them connect with the audience
- Ish had to help the group see that the confusion was a necessary part of the process, rather than a reason to reject Dave's input

**The Outcome**:
- The group eventually came together and learned to appreciate each other's unique perspectives
- Dave Romero's unconventional approach helped the group break through their own stagnation and rediscover the power of true, emotional connection in their performances.

#### The Three Inventions

**The Three Inventions: Toward the End of Life**

**Senegalese Dilemma**:
- The Senegealese dilemma is a philosophical problem about accepting or denying one's own suffering and the suffering of others.
- It revolves around the idea that those who are suffering may not have access to things like compassion, physical comfort, and presence from others.
- Examples: 
  - A sick child who doesn't have access to medical care and comfort
  - A worker who is exploited and doesn't have a community to support them
  - These situations demonstrate the "many problems" that descriptive summaries convey, which cannot be fully grasped through statistical analysis.

**The Marqueette Effect**:
- The Marquee Effect refers to the idea that things that are hidden or denied can still be powerful and influential.
- This is demonstrated by the example of the Senegealese dilemma, where suffering is often hidden behind a veneer of civility.
- The "poor child" in this metaphor represents those who suffer but are not acknowledged or supported by others.

**The Canvas Dilemma**:
- The Canvas Dilemma refers to the difficulty of fully grasping the complexity and depth of experiences, which cannot be captured by a single, objective perspective.
- This is demonstrated by the idea that a painting (representing a "many problems" summary) may reveal deeper layers of meaning that are not initially apparent.

**The Gospel Dilemma**:
- The Gospel Dilemma refers to the idea that truths can be hidden or distorted, and that understanding requires looking beyond what is immediately evident.
- This is demonstrated by the idea that "God's laws" (representing deeper truths) are often veiled by human interpretations and actions.

**The Conundrum of Compassion**:
- The Conundrum of Compassion refers to the difficulty of fully embracing compassion for others, especially when one's own suffering may overshadow the suffering of others.
- This is demonstrated by the idea that a "compassionate" person may still struggle to truly empathize with the suffering of another due to their own experiences.

**Analogy of Desire:**
- Human behavior can be seen as an internal drive or mode that guides us through life experiences
