# René Girard's Mimetic Theory (Studies in Violence, Mimesis, and Culture) (2013)

> A systematic introduction into the mimetic theory of the French- American literary theorist and philosophical anthropologist René Girard, this essential text explains its three main pillars (mimetic desire, the scapegoat mechanism, and the Biblical “difference”) with the help of examples from literature and philosophy. This book also offers an overview of René Girard’s life and work, showing how much mimetic theory results from existential and spiritual insights into one’s own mimetic entanglements. Furthermore it examines the broader implications of Girard’s theories, from the mimetic aspect of sovereignty and wars to the relationship between the scapegoat mechanism and the question of capital punishment. Mimetic theory is placed within the context of current cultural and political debates like the relationship between religion and modernity, terrorism, the death penalty, and gender issues. - [The Mimetic Brain Studies in Violence, Mimesis, and Culture](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Girards-Mimetic-Studies-Violence-Mimesis/dp/1611860776)

### Preface

**Girard's Mimetic Theory: A Hedgehog's One Big Idea**

**Background:**
- Archilochus' quote differentiated "hedgehogs" (Plato, Dante, Hegel, Dostoyevsky) from "foxes" (Aristotle, Shakespeare, Goethe) based on their approach to understanding phenomena.
- Girard is described as a "hedgehog" for his focus on the mimetic cycle as the core of his thought.

**Components of Mimetic Cycle:**
1. **Mimetic Rivalry and Crisis**: Analysis of mimetic desire, anthropological foundation of theory.
2. **Scapegoat Mechanism**: Origin of collective violence and new social order.
3. **Divinization of Sacrificed Victim**: Origins of archaic religion in Christianity.

**Book Structure:**
- Three central chapters on the mimetic cycle components.
- Introduction to Girard's work and contextualization within contemporary debate on secularization (left panel).
- Additional applications: politics, gender relations (right panel).

**Girard's Personal Conversion**: Focus on the mimetic cycle was due to a personal experience in 1959.

**Mimetic Theory and Secularization:**
- Distinctive approach to religion in modernity compared to theories of secularization.

**Additional Applications:**
- Politics: origin of political power, death penalty, friend/enemy relations, war.
- Gender relations: rejecting differences between male and female desire, cultural tendency towards persecution of women.

**Book Development Timeline**: Research lasted 10 years with support from Raymund Schwager.

**Acknowledgements:**
- Raymund Schwager for making Girard's work known and supporting the author's own research.


### Preface to the English Edition

**Girard's Mimetic Theory: Expansion and Future Directions**

**Expansion of Acceptance**:
- Worldwide acceptance of Girard's mimetic theory has expanded significantly since publication in 2003.
- Numerous honorary doctorates, including induction into the Académie française in 2005.
- Recognition in Germany, with the Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize at Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen.

**Interdisciplinary Dialogue**:
- Represents in natural sciences have engaged in dialogue with empirical researchers on mimetic behavior in humans and animals.
- Research on imitation among young children and discovery of mirror neurons have highlighted the importance of mimesis in social life.

**Future Directions**:
- Criticism that Girard's work emphasizes the superiority of Christianity and Judaism, limiting the universal potential of mimetic theory.
- Need to consider religions beyond Judaism and Christianity, as other traditions may offer ways out of the world of scapegoat mechanism.

**Interreligious Dialogue**:
- Girard's position on the superiority of Christianity criticized as too narrow by Indian essayist Pankaj Mishra and some younger scholars.
- Need to incorporate other religions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam, into mimetic theory research.

**Exploring Islam from the Perspective of Mimetic Theory**:
- Few remarks on Islam from Girard, with wishes for more comprehensive studies.
- Research group at Innsbruck University published a collection of articles in 2009 to understand Islam from the perspective of mimetic theory.
- Plans exist to incorporate Muslim colleagues directly in future research.

**Collaboration and Support**:
- Translation by Gabriel Borruss, Martina Pamer's Index creation, inclusion in Michigan State University Press series, and financial support from Imitatio.

- Grand Inquisitor's belief that humans have a need for communal worship, even without gods (negatively marked character)
- Makar from "The Adolescent": every person needs to worship something; rejection of God leads to idol worship
- Dostoyevsky's intensive study of biblical scripture influenced his understanding of human religious nature

**Proust's Exploration of Religion in Human Relationships**
- Proust's work challenges the modern theory of secularization, like Dostoyevsky
- Characters in Proust's novels worship their role models as gods and approach them with religious devotion
- Example: Marcel's desire for Albertine fluctuates based on his jealousy, creating a quasi-religious fascination
- Objective reasoning cannot explain these relationships; the women are seen as "occult forces" or "goddesses"
- Characters seek to establish contact with these forces, not just the women themselves.

**Relationship between Dostoyevsky and Proust's Explorations of Religion**
- Both authors explore human religious nature in their works
- Dostoyevsky focuses on nationalism and individual faith, while Proust examines interpersonal relationships and divinization
- Modern man's need to find divine self in others after "God is dead" (Girard's perspective).


#### Interpersonal Divinization: Jealousy, Obsession, and Desire in Literature (Hölderlin, Dostoyevsky, Nietzsche)

**Interpersonal Divinization: A Comparative Analysis of Dostoyevsky, Proust, Hölderlin, and Nietzsche**

**Anthropology and Interpersonal Divinization**
- Feuerbach's philosophy: "Homo homini deus" or Men will become gods for one another.
- Novelistic authors explore interpersonal divinization in terms of jealousy, emotional bondage, masochism, sadism, and violence.

**Dostoyevsky's Underground Man**
- Yearns for ultimate superiority over others.
- Perceives himself as insignificant as dirt or a worm compared to the "others" who become gods.

**Shatov in Dostoyevsky's Demons**
- Sees Stavrogin as "the sun."
- Young Verkhovensky worships Stavrogin as the divine idol par excellence.

**Hölderlin and Schiller**
- Hölderlin's relationship to Friedrich Schiller: idolization of a divine genius.
- Letters show intense reverence for Schiller, fear of being criticized by him.

**Nietzsche and Richard Wagner**
- Early worship of Wagner as a divinity.
- Breaking ties with Wagner and attempting to usurp his former model's divine stature.
- Attempts to build a cult around his own being, seeking to replace Wagner as a god.

**Nietzsche's Manic-Depressive Oscillations**
- Identifying himself with Dionysos and Jesus (Ecce Homo).
- Falling from self-proclaimed divine heights into self-victimization.


#### Exploring Human Idolatry: Camus vs. Girard on Religion and Metaphysical Revolt

**Girard's Mimetic Theory: God or Idolatry?**

**Overview:**
- Girard's mimetic theory based on human being's choice between recognition of the one true God and arbitrary idolatry
- Man believes in either a God or an idol; no third option (Max Scheler)
- Rooted in biblical thinking, with focus on Dostoyevsky's work

**Girard and Dostoyevsky:**
- Grand Inquisitor legend: "God or idol" choice
- Background from Matthew's Gospel (deuteronomy 5:9, temptation of Christ)
- Jesus' allegory of exorcism leading to return of seven worse spirits
- Importance of biblical background and understanding the present state of religion

**Girard vs. Camus:**
- Both explore human idolatry in modernity
- Camus: metaphysical revolt, man attempting to take God's place
  - Nietzsche’s Übermensch, Rousseau’s social contracts, divinization of state and Marxism/Leninism
- Critique of idolatry in thought and literature
- Differences: Girard proposes biblical revelation as way to freedom from idolatry; Camus calls for renunciation but doesn't offer a positive solution.

**Girard's Perspective:**
- Overcoming the revolt is necessary for release, only possible through Christ
- Idolatry leads to terror and human division
- Biblical revelation as the means to freedom from idolatry.


### 3. Mimetic Desire

**Mimetic Desire Theory**

**Background:**
- Goethe's observation: danger of friends desiring loved ones or rivals becoming models
- Mimetic theory as a theory of conflict
- Long exclusion from theoretical discussion in German-speaking world due to focus on peace and prosperity, trauma of National Socialism

**Mimetic Theory and Conﬂict:**
- Principal source of human conﬂicts: mimetic rivalry - imitation of models who become rivals or rivals who become models
- Diverges from theories focusing on natural aggression drive
- Human being's violent nature can be overcome
- Desire not based on spontaneity but on desires that surround the subject
- Imitation of others' desires (mimetic desire)

**Key Concepts:**
- Our neighbor is the model for our desires
- Openness of humans to others: fundamental dependence on relationships with others
- No human being is intrinsically complete
- Emphasis on imitation as description, not caricature of humanity

**Mimetic Theory vs. Natural Aggression Drive:**
- Rejects theories seeing violence as instinctual phenomenon or ineradicable trait of human nature
- Sermon on the Mount (nonviolence) is a plausible attempt to overcome violence
- Natural appetites fall short of explaining essence of desire.

**Mimetic Theory and Literature:**
- Major novels of European literature postulate humans don't know what to desire, imitate others' desires
- Examples: Triangular desire, desire according to Another, imitated desire, mimetic desire (various formulations in Girard's work).


#### Mimesis and human desire: conflict and violence in social relations.

**Mimesis and Human Nature**

**Descartes and Romantic Individualism**:
- Descartes' "cogito ergo sum" represented the anthropocentric turning point
- Enabled humans to break free of Augustinian individuality anchored in relationship to Christian God
- Led to ideas of man as self-contained being

**Mimesis and Human Relations**:
- Mimesis is a fundamental part of human constitution, not an external addition
- Contradicts Aristotle's "zoon politikon" concept of peaceful and harmonious coexistence
- More closely aligns with Hobbes' view of humans as conflict-prone

**Mimetic Theory and Augustine**:
- Girard's mimetic theory is between two poles: Aristotle's "homo homini amicus" (man is a friend to man) and Hobbes' "homo homini lupus" (man is a wolf to man)
- Converges with Augustine's view that human nature is social but also prone to conflict
- Links mimetic rivalry and interpersonal violence to idolatry of self or other

**Mimesis and Violence**:
- Mimetic desire can lead to violence and murder as people compete for limited objects
- Not all human actions and relationships are governed by violent mimesis
- Girard emphasizes the need to better understand this central dimension of human nature

**Sexuality and Violence**:
- Human sexuality is more violent than animal sexuality due to its highly mimetic dimension
- Leads to conflicts over objects that cannot be shared
- Connected to violence in various direct (e.g., abduction, rape) and indirect ways


#### Connection between Sexuality and Violence in Western Thought: Mimetic Desire versus Rousseau's Optimism.

**Sexuality and Violence: Camille Paglia vs. René Girard**

**Connection between Sexuality and Violence:**
- Both Paglia and Girard explore the connection between sexuality and violence
- Paglia argues it's a natural constant, while Girard sees it as motivated by mimetic desire

**Camille Paglia:**
- Criticizes modern repression of human sexuality
- Believes sexuality is intrinsically connected to violence
- Compares her perspective with Marquis de Sade and Rousseau

**Jean-Jacques Rousseau:**
- Optimistic view on human nature in Discourse on Inequality
- Argues that only humans in society experience violent sexuality, not animals or "man of nature"
- Explains the need for "comparison" as a cause of conﬂict and violence

**Mimetic Desire:**
- Key concept in Girard's mimetic theory
- Diverges from Rousseau's perspective on man in state of nature
- Argues that human beings have permanent sexuality leading to increase potential for conflict, whether in society or nature.

**Western Tradition and Mimesis:**
- Mimesis has been a significant concept in Western philosophical tradition
- Aristotle, Gabriel Tarde, Walter Benjamin, Friedrich August von Hayek are some notable thinkers who emphasized the role of imitation in understanding human life.
- Girard's mimetic theory diverges from traditional interpretations by focusing on mimetic desire as a driving force behind violence.


#### Plato's Ontology of Imitation and Mimetic Desire: Fear and Ethics

**Paisley Livingston's Findings on Mimesis**
* Many recent studies highlight the central role of imitation in human existence
* Plato's work establishes an "ontology of imitation" where every reality is imitated
* Plato had a complex relationship with mimesis: reduced it to external representation but also recognized its dangers

**Features of Mimesis in Plato's Republic**
1. Reduction to external forms of representation and performance:
   - Question about poets imitating others in voice or looks (Book 3)
2. Ethical dimension:
   - Guardians encouraged to imitate good examples, avoid negative ones
   - Children's upbringing emphasizes this distinction
3. Fear of the power of mimesis and acquisitive desire:
   - Call to ban all imitative art in Book 10
   - Concern about imitation leading to rivalry over objects (nourishment, territory, women)

**Plato's Criticism of Mimesis vs. Permitted Imitation**
* Plato criticizes mimesis in human sphere but permits imitation of the divine
* Only permitted songs praising gods allowed in his ideal state
1. Phyllosopher king argument:
   - Man focused on eternal ideas doesn't envy humans and imitates them (Book 7)
2. Differentiated understanding of positive and negative forms of mimesis

**Impact on Christian Tradition**
* Plato's understanding of mimesis influenced Augustine's theology significantly
* Human beings must imitate what they worship, as seen in the passage from Th e Republic (Book 10)


#### Mimetic Desire: Human Conflicts and Imitative Desires in Literature and Philosophy (Plato, Girard)

**Plato's View on Mimesis:**
- Plato warns against exclusive reverence towards human beings, directing it only towards divine beings
- Fears the power of mimesis leading to envy and conflict
- In Western tradition, this fear disappears and mimesis becomes associated with representation and ethical imitation

**Aristotle's Perspective on Mimesis:**
- Aristotle recognizes human aptitude for imitation
- Pleasure derived from imitating others in drama leads to catharsis of emotions (pity and fear)
- Mimesis in acquisitive behavior can cause conflict when objects are non-shareable

**Girard's Theory on Acquisitive Mimesis:**
- Focuses on the relationship between mimesis, desire, and confl ict
- Human beings strive to possess same desires as others leading to competition and rivalry (conflictual mimesis)
- Triangle model: imitating subject, object, and mediator/role model can cause conflicts

**Examples of Mimetic Desire in Literature:**
- Shakespeare's works portray human emotions' fickle nature, leading to sudden transformations from love to hatred
- Examples include Coriolanus and The Two Gentlemen of Verona
- Friends becoming enemies over a small difference or due to external influences (objects, lovers)

**Conflicts Caused by Mimetic Desire:**
- Not fully explained by superficial theories of human relations
- Shakespeare's characters demonstrate intense rivalry and hatred in the face of mimetic desires.


#### Mimetic Desire in Shakespeare's Plays and Novelistic Writers: Imitation and Conflict.

**Mimetic Desire in Shakespeare's Plays**

**Proteus and Silvia**:
- Proteus experiences rivalry and enmity towards Valentine due to his love for Julia
- The drama revolves around Proteus attempting to rape Silvia, which is prevented by Valentine
- The resolution of the dispute leads to the preservation of their friendship

**Comparison to Cervantes' Don Quixote**:
- Quixote imitates Amadis de Gaul, a hero from a novel of chivalry, in his desire to become a knight
- Sancho Panza also seeks to become a duke, influenced by the imitation of his master, Don Quixote

**Flaubert's Madame Bovary**:
- Emma Bovary is influenced by romantic novels and their portrayal of love
- She experiences vicarious desire through the characters in her books, leading to her own extramarital affairs
- Flaubert explores the concept of imitation in the formation of desires and relationships

**Stendhal's The Red and the Black**:
- Mathilde de la Mole finds role models within her family history


#### Mimetic Desire in Literature: Napoleon's Impact and Women's Attraction

**Julien Sorel's Imitation of Napoleon**
- Julien is fascinated by a solitary eagle, seeing it as a reflection of his own aspirations to be like Napoleon
- Julien attempts to emulate Napoleon's military prowess and seduction abilities
- Julien views the seduction of Madame de Rênal as a military fight, examining every detail as he would a soldier

**Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past**
- **Swann's Relationship with Odette**: Swann's extreme passion for Odette remains inexplicable by her objective qualities. He realizes she did not appeal to him, but still desires her because other men desire her
- The "hell" that Swann goes through is explained as a result of the mimetic nature of desire: he feels compelled to master Odette entirely out of the need to compete with other men for her affection

**Other Instances of Mimetic Desire in Proust's Work**:
- Men are attracted to women who have strayed because they feel the need to rescue them, even if they do not objectively find the woman attractive
- Marcel's attraction to the actress Berma is awakened by Bergotte's admiration of her performances. When he sees Berma on stage, his expectations are disappointed, but the disappointment is temporary


#### Mimetic Desire: Imitating rivals in literature and complex emotions

**Marcel's Perception of Berma's Performance:**
- **Applause from audience**: Marcel joins in, changes evaluation of performance to "great"
- **Seeking corroboration**: Marcel seeks confirmation of Berma's greatness from Monsieur de Norpois
- **Critical acclaim**: Later that evening, reading in Le Figaro praising Berma's performance as the purest manifestation of dramatic art
- **Aesthetic enjoyment**: Dependent on external, mimetic corroboration

**Dostoyevsky's Short Story "The Eternal Husband":**
- **Trusotsky's Revenge**: Attends funeral of wife's lover, forces kiss from rival V elchaninov
- **Freud's Interpretation**: Strong innate bisexual disposition leads to latent homosexuality in Dostoyevsky's work
- **Girard's Explanation**: Mimetic desire directed at mediator (V elchaninov) develops into direct erotic fantasies
- **Trusotsky's Ambivalence**: Love and hate towards rival, oscillating between extremes. Attempts to murder V elchaninov but is hindered by his strength.


#### Mimetic desire and its impact on human relationships in literature: Cervantes to Dostoyevsky.

**Mimesis and Desire in Literature: From Cervantes to Dostoyevsky**

**Background:**
- Human beings borrow desires from models (Cervantes, Flaubert, Proust, Dostoyevsky)
- Significant differences in interpretation of desire

**External Mediation:**
- Role model remains outside personal sphere
- No conflict or rivalry between imitator and model
  * Don Quixote and Amadis of Gaul (Cervantes)
  * Sancho Panza as disciple, no conflict
- Mimesis contained, conﬂictual dimension hidden

**Internal Mediation:**
- Role model becomes part of imitator's world
- Conflict arises between subjects desiring the same object
  * Stendhal: vanity and rivalry (vain subject desires object when another does)
  * Proust: snobbism, private sphere (imitating subject trusts judgment of others)
- Dostoyevsky: jealousy and envy in family relations (admiration and hatred one and the same)

**Development of Mimesis:**
- Cervantes' Don Quixote: imitator distant from model, untouchable hero in foreground
- Dostoyevsky's Th e Eternal Husband: mediator (V elchaninov) becomes central figure, no clear distinction between imitator and model

**Girard's Perspective:**
- All mimetic desire is one fundamental unity despite various forms
- Identifies mimetic desire as hermeneutic tool for understanding all novelistic creation.

**Cervantes' "Ill-advised Curiosity":**
- Anselmo asks Lotario (friend and model) to seduce his wife Camilla to test her loyalty.
- Lotario eventually gives in to Anselmo's request, leading to conflict and conﬂictual dimension becoming apparent.


#### Mimetic Desire and the Dangers of Equality: Understanding Modern Conflict Through Literature and Sociology.

**Mimetic Desire: Cervantes' Novella and Dostoyevsky's Th e Eternal Husband**

**Parallel Themes:**
- Both texts depict tragic endings due to mimetic desire
- Anselmo in Cervantes' novella, like T Rusotsky in Dostoyevsky's work, requires mediation to desire his wife
- Unity of novelistic literature through the presence of external and internal mediation

**Mimetic Desire:**
- Ideal type: Cervantes' Don Quixote and Amadis of Gaul
- Emergence of modern world with increasing egalitarianism
  - Disappearing social differences
  - Increase in competition, envy, rivalry

**Modern Equality:**
- Potential dangers: increase in social violence (Antje Vollmer's "Heißer Frieden")
- Reactionary movements attempt to maintain social differences but are akin to acting against divine providence

**Civil War and Mimesis:**
- Prevalence of violence in cultures where victims and perpetrators are close proximity (Wolfgang Sofsky)
  - Misconception: violence caused by anonymity or depersonalization
  - Proximity heightens passion of violence

**Civil Wars:**
- Bosnian civil war as illustrative example
  - Lack of significant cultural differences between groups
  - Equality as central cause for extreme atrocities.


#### Exploring the roots of conflict: narcissism of small differences and intergroup relations.

**The Yugoslav Succession Conflicts: Nationalism and Religion as Driving Forces**

**Causes of the Wars**:
- Complex historical and political forces
- Not ethnic conflicts, as most combatants are of the same ethnos
- Religion is a crucial factor dividing the Serbs, Croats, and Moslems
- Centuries of being asked to choose between competing empires and ideologies defined by religion

**The "Narcissism of Small Differences"**:
- The Bosnian Serbs, Croats, and Moslems have been adorned with different cultural uniforms over the centuries
- Underneath the dress, they can see themselves reflected in each other, leading to violent proportions
- Fighters must exterminate the opposite community to deal with this realization

**Michael Ignatieff's Interpretation**:
- Freud's concept of "narcissism of small differences" can help understand the causes of the atrocities in Bosnia
- Enemies need each other to remind themselves of their true national identity
- Without hatred, there would be no clearly defined national self to worship and adore

**Samuel Huntington's Interpretation**:
- Denies Freud's "narcissism of small differences" in his interpretation of the Bosnian conflict
- Attempts to re-enable a global structure that makes civil wars more controllable
- Observations demonstrate the roots of human conflict lie within the interrelations within groups themselves

**War Emerging from Within Cultural Groups**:
- War emerges from within the cultural group itself, not external differences
- **Saint Thomas Aquinas**: People who hold nothing in common do not seem to get into legal disputes, but those who do hold something in common
- **Adam Smith**: National feelings of hatred seldom extend beyond neighboring nations


#### Mimetic Desire and Modern Society: Imitation's Paradoxical Role in Advertising and Fashion

**Mimetic Theory: Connection between Violence and Diminishing Difference**
- **Violence** and diminishing difference connection described by authors but explanation for its origins missing
- **Mimetic theory** provides an explanation by showing how disappearance of physical or metaphysical difference leads to increase in conflict between groups
- Conflicts between equals have greatest risk of turning violent as social limitations preventing/channeling mimetic desire are missing

**Modern Rejection of Imitation and its Paradoxical Nature**
- Modern society rejects imitation, valuing originality instead
- This rejection is a product of intensified mimetic desire for internal mimesis
- Enemies reject imitation while trying to be unique but increase identicalness through anti-models
- Mimetic nature of desire retained or intensified in modern world

**Mimetic Desire and Modern Phenomena: Advertising and Fashion**
- **Advertising**: Triangular structure illustrates mimetic desire, promises originality but conforms to anti-mimetic atmosphere, leading to paradoxical nature
- **Fashion**: Unprecedented tyranny of fashion results from modern rejection of imitation, creates a need for constant updating and conforming to trends.


#### Exploring Fashion's Mimetic Nature: Imitation, Individuality, and Social Psychology.

**Georg Simmel's Philosophy of Fashion**

**Fashion as Imitation and Differentiation**:
- Fashion is the "imitation of a given pattern" that satisfies the need for social adaptation
- Fashion leads individuals onto the "path that everyone travels" and "furnishes a general condition that resolves the conduct of every individual into a mere example"
- However, fashion can also be the desire for differentiation and distinction

**Sociological Analysis of Fashion**:
- Sociologists examine either the initial moment of imitation or the ensuing desire for difference
- Simmel seeks to unite these two aspects

**Fashion as Self-Contradictory Tendencies**:
- Fashion is determined by two self-contradicting tendencies: **imitation** and **desire for differentiation**

**Examples of the Interaction between Imitation and Differentiation**:
1. The "slave to fashion" - Imitates fashion beyond its usual limits, creating a semblance of individuality
2. "Negative imitation" - Consciously dressing in an unmodern manner to demonstrate non-imitation, which is still a form of imitation

**Snobbism and Anti-Mimetic Mimesis**:
- Snobs attempt to differentiate from the herd but are unable to shake off their imitative tendencies
- Their "disgust" in others reflects their own mimetic nature


#### Mimetic Desire in Literature: Girard, Sartre and Human Yearning for Being.

**Girard's Theory of Mimetic Desire: The Modern Context of Snobbism**
* **Snobbism as a Form of Imitation**: Girard argues that snobbism is an expression of mimetic desire, where individuals imitate and desire objects or social statuses desired by others.
* **Equal Democracy as Prerequisite**: The modern atmosphere of equality is necessary for the emergence of snobbism, which causes people to be slaves of fashion and desire only what is popular.
* **Convergence with Sartre's Philosophy**: Girard finds convergence between his mimetic theory and Jean-Paul Sartre's philosophy, particularly in understanding human desire as a "desire to be God" driven by a lack of being (manque d’être).
* **The Lack of Being (manqué d'être)**: Sartre's concept of man as fundamentally lacking in being is similar to the mimetic structure of snobbism, where individuals seek to become being en-soi or transcend their own facticity.
* **Projects and Desires**: Each human being sets goals for themselves (projets) based on desires, which aim at achieving being en-soi and overcoming their lack of being.
* **The Waiter as an Example of Bad Faith**: Sartre's concept of mauvaise foi is illustrated through the example of a waiter who pretends to be a waiter in a café, revealing his desire for tangible being "in itself".
* **Reification and Disappointment**: The search for being in-itself ends in disappointment as humans discover their own groundlessness, leading to two forms of reification: creating objects or possessing objects.
* **Anti-Semitism as a Form of Reification**: In Sartre's essay "Anti-Semite and Jew," he explains anti-Semitism as rooted in the yearning for being en-soi, which is never fully attainable.


#### Exploring human existence: Sartre vs. Girard on identity, desire, and the role of the other.

**Sartre's Analysis of Anti-Semitism:**
* The anti-Semite fears human freedom and existence, represented by the groundlessness of human life
* Chooses an existence based on a tangible thing (stone) to establish a sense of identity
* Antisemitism is a way for the anti-Semite to stifle anxieties by believing their place in the world is predetermined
* Anti-Semitism is fear of the human condition and desire to be an inflexible, stone-like being
* Sartre's concept of "being-for-others" allows for observations on shame, pride, affection, and sadomasochism
* The other plays a significant role in determining the subject's desires and sense of existence

**Comparison between Sartre and Girard:**
* Both explore fundamental lack of being
* Differences: Girard emphasizes the importance of the other; Sartre remains caught in Cartesian individualism
* Convergence: Sartre's "being-for-others" concept aligns with Girard's mimetic theory

**Sartre's Being and Nothingness:**
* The subject can only exist as "for-itself" for the others, not on its own
* Autonomy is unbridled, leading to a "phantasm of self-creation"
* Criticized by Peter Bürger for promoting masculine self-creation over reciprocal constitution between self and others.

**Girard's Perspective:**
* The human yearning for being in-itself is not original desire, but a consequence of intensified mimetic desire
* Search for the perfect role model, who radiates complete inner tranquility, drives this yearning.


#### Mimetic Desire and the Yearning for Inaccessible Being in Literature

**Mimetic Desire and the Yearning for Being**

**The Attraction of Indifference**:
- The more self-assured a model appears, the more the desiring subject assumes the model possesses a perfect being
- This search is directed at a transcendent form of being
- Models that radiate indifference are able to excite human fascination
- Even instances of "stupidity" can awaken strong forms of male sexual desire
- Cats have become a universal symbol of sexual attraction, as they represent the attractiveness of human indifference

**The Idolization of "Coolness"**:
- The attractive power of cold and indifferent things is explained by the mimetic nature of desire
- The individual becomes increasingly bewildered and unbalanced by a desire which nothing can satisfy
- They seek the divine essence in that which radically denies their own existence: the inanimate

**The Yearning for Simplified Being**:
- Literature is full of examples of the yearning for simplified, lower forms of being
- Examples include Dostoyevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov" and Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past"
- These works portray philosophies that attempt to raise this yearning to ontological heights as mere products of mimetic despair

**Modern Philosophy and the Yearning for Death**:
- Modern philosophical ideas, such as Rousseau's ideal natural condition and Hegel's "End of History", are products of mimetic desire
- Ideas like Nietzsche's "amor fati" and Freud's theory of narcissism also stem from this desire
- Contemporary philosopher Ulrich Horstmann's treatise "Das Untier" calls for a return to the inorganic through modern weapons of mass destruction


#### Mimetic desire, yearning for lifelessness, and human relationships in philosophical perspectives

**Freud's Theory of Narcissism and Mimetic Desire**

**Freud's Philosophy**:
- About the "descending of lunar lifelessness onto the animate earth"
- "For not until the sickle of the moon reflects itself here on earth in a thousand craters, not until the image before and after—moon and world—have become indistinguishable and quartz crystals blink at each other across the abyss under starlight, not until the final oasis dries up, the last sigh drowns out, and the last seed withers will Eden return to the earth."

**Freud's Theory of Narcissism**:
- Freud does not explicitly reference a yearning for the inorganic, but displays human desire for lower, intellectually reduced forms of being
- Speaks of the attractiveness of women, children, certain animals, and literary representations of criminals and humorists
- **Narcissism is illusory; it is a strategy used by "coquetry"**

**Girard's Perspective**:
- Desires are directed at subhuman forms of being or purely tangible being
- Anticipates Freud's later theory of the death drive, which Girard connects to mimetic rivalry

**Sartre's Existentialism and Mimetic Desire**:
- Sartre's yearning for lifeless "being-in-itself" contains traces of mimetic desire
- The concept of "bad faith" in Sartre is used by Girard to describe the duplicity produced by mimetic desire
- Girard sees the imitation of a positive role model as the only way out of the "metaphysical underground"

**Differences between Sartre and Girard**:
- Sartre interprets man's attempt to fuse being-for-self and being-in-itself as the desire to become God
- Girard sees it as a divinization of the role model, who remains unaffected by the lack of being
- Girard's explicit use of Sartre's vocabulary highlights their differing interpretations

**Kierkegaard and Girard's Concept of Being**:
- Girard risks confirming critics who accuse mimetic theory of an "ontology of violence" due to Sartre's autonomous individual and perpetual conflict in human relations.


#### Exploring Human Desire: Sartre, Kierkegaard, and the Roots of Violence

**Sartre's Philosophy: The Ontologization of Violence**

**No Exit**: Garcin concludes that "Hell is—other people."

**Anti-Semitism**: Sartre sees it as a consequence of class society, to be overcome by revolution.

**Critique of Sartre's Thesis**:
- The negation of private property does not liberate human society from conflict
- Conflict arises from the relationships between individual human beings, not the fight for tangible objects

**Mimetic Rivalry and Anti-Semitism**:
- The more humans compete, the more they seek ﬂight into reduced forms of being (e.g., anti-Semitism, xenophobia, mass consumerism)
- Sartre hints at this link but does not provide a systematic explanation within his philosophy

**Girard's Mimetic Theory vs. Sartre**:
- Girard's claim that the lack of being leads to mimetic rivalry represents an ontology of violence similar to Sartre's arguments
- However, Girard's thought is rooted in a Christian perspective, which differs from Sartre's atheistic stance

**Kierkegaard's Insights**:
- Provides insights into the mimetic nature of human desire through stories like the "worried lily"
- Concept of anxiety as the consequence of man's dependence on his creator and inability to escape their createdness
- Man's positive lack of being, rooted in creatureliness, leads to worldly attempts to ﬁll it which end in despair and violence

**Augustine and Catholic Philosophy**:
- Augustine's Confessions: Man is a "piece of Your creation," with an inner disquiet that drives the search for God
- Human needfulness and lack of being can only be replenished by God


#### Mimetic Desire: Augustine, Pride, Vanity, and Envy in Western Thought

**Girard's Mimetic Theory vs. Sartre's Perspective**

**Girard's Mimetic Theory**:
- Humans must refocus their desire on God to avoid worldly seduction and violence
- Represents a fundamental shift from other modes of thought that prevent human beings from directing their desire at a transcendental God
- The biblical account of the Fall of Man takes on central significance

**Sartre's Perspective**:
- Rejects the notion of a creator-God and the idea of man being "created"
- Equates "being-created-by-God" with "total enslavement" of humanity
- Describes the Fall of Man as not resulting from misbehavior, but from the existence of the Other
- Human beings become "defenseless objects, things, that evoke the original shame of Adam and Eve"

**Mimetic Passions of Competition: Vanity, Pride, and Envy**:
- These passions are at the core of the more extreme manifestations of mimetic desire
- Theoretical observations of these passions span the entire occidental tradition
- Augustine's Confessions is a predecessor to Girard's mimetic theory, as human desire is based on imitation of role models

**Augustine's Understanding of Mimetic Desire**:
- Example of Alypius being drawn into the crowd's passion for gladiator battles despite his initial resolve
- Envy appears among infants, not due to scarcity of material goods but the sight of the other


#### Augustine's Confessions: Mimetic Desire, Human Relationships, and Divine Imitation.

**Augustine's Discovery of Mimetic Nature**

**The Presence of Mimetic Desire**:
- Augustine observes his own mimetic nature through the examples of Alypius and himself
- Augustine was driven by **pride and vanity**, often acting out of peer pressure and pursuit of "bauble fame"

**Augustine's Role Models**:
- Augustine describes himself as being **seduced by the crowd** during his Manichean period
- He admires the Roman orator Hierius, not just for his speeches but for how others praised him
- Augustine runs through a series of role models until he converts to Christianity

**Augustine's Theological System**:
- Augustine classifies human race into two branches: those "who live by human standards" and those "who live according to God’s will"
- He distinguishes between **love of oneself (amor sui)** and **divine love (amor Dei)**
- Original Sin is man's denial of God and attempt to take God's place, a "perverse imitation" of God

**Augustine's Influence from Plato**:
- Augustine shares Plato's ontology of **imitation**, recognizing humans' tendency to model themselves on their worship objects
- He praises Plato's ethics as ultimately directed at **divine imitation**

**Augustine's Separation of Desire**:
- Augustine separates desire according to its temporal or eternal goods
- Only **eternal goods** are worthy of human aspiration, as they are humanity's ultimate aim
- Earthly goods should be utilized only to achieve the joy of eternal happiness

**Augustine's Perspective on the Earthly City and Heavenly City**:
- The earthly city is marked by **self-love**, resulting in confl ict over scarce objects
- The heavenly city is characterized by the **humble imitation of God**, free from the violence of mimetic rivalry


#### Mimetic Desire and Christian Ethical System: Augustine's Goods and Conflict Avoidance.

**Mimetic Desire and Christian Order of Goods**

**The Mimetic Theory**:
- Explains Augustine's differentiation between eternal and temporal goods
- Mimetic desire directs people towards the same objects, leading to:
  - Violent conflict (Hobbesian war of all against all) or
  - Mutual enrichment on the path to eternal aim

**Augustine's Differentiation**:
- Eternal and temporal goods form the basis of Christian ethical system
- Helps avoid mimetic passion of envy
- Parallels found in works of other Christian thinkers, like Thomas Aquinas

**Thomas Aquinas on Emuulation and Envy**:
- Draws on Augustine's differentiation between temporal and eternal desires
- Argues that zealous imitation is laudable when directed at virtuous goods
- Contrasts with envy towards temporal goods

**Dante's Divine Comedy**:
- Distinctly portrays the Christian order of goods and its impact on mimetic desire
- Eternal desires bring unity, while temporal desires cause division and conflict

**Pascal's Insight on True Good**:
- Recognize that the "true good" is found in God alone
- Unifies all, unlike material values which are divisive

**Max Scheler's Hierarchical System of Values**:
- Divine values unite humans, while material values divide
- Reference to religious wars highlights the limits of value analysis alone

**Girard's Critique of Scheler**:
- Overemphasis on desirability of objects hinders understanding of mimetic processes
- Argues Paolo and Francesca were influenced by arbitrary desires in literature, not divine Word

**Girard's View on Modern Philosophy**:
- Critical of modern philosophy's ability to reveal the roots of mimetic desire
- Prefers the insights of Augustine and great European novelists


#### Hobbes' political philosophy on human desire, competition, and mimesis.

**Mimetic Desire in Modern Philosophy: Thomas Hobbes**

**Characteristics of Mimetic Passions:**
- Fueled by competitive desire and comparison to others
- Manifestations of pride, envy, hatred, emulation, repentance, etc. (Hobbes' Leviathan)
- Driven by the need for power, honor, prestige, or superiority over others
- Absence of transcendence leads to mere reflection on the phenomenon

**Thomas Hobbes:**
- English political philosopher on the threshold of modernity
- Analyzed mimetic passions in context of social equality and competition
- Compared life to a "race" where individuals compete for foremost position (Leviathan)
- Identified mimetic tendencies in characters, such as Goethe's Werther, Dostoyevsky’s Underground Man
- Placed imitation at the heart of his interpretation of mankind (Behemoth)
- Viewed interpersonal relations as determined by competition and comparison for power, honor, or prestige.

**Impact on Modern Society:**
- Constant need to compare oneself to others leads to mutual desire for same objects
- Resulting rivalry, violence, and war if these objects cannot be shared (Leviathan)
- Absolute state proposed to prevent internal conflict by transforming rivalries into competition between individual states.

**Hobbes' View on Pride:**
- Places great importance on concepts of pride and envy
- Belongs to the list of authors who merely reflect consequences of mimetic desire instead of revealing its roots.


#### Comparing Hobbes and Spinoza's philosophies on human desire, mimetic theory, and competition.

**Girard's Theory vs. Hobbes' Philosophy:**
- Both appear similar but hide fundamental differences
- Girard advocates for openness to transcendence as a way to overcome human violence and competition (Augustine, love of God)
- Hobbes denies any escape from man's violent nature
- Voegeelin's analysis: Hobbes' philosophy reduces human existence to amor sui, excludes transcendence; Augustine contrasts proud beings with those pursuing amor Dei.

**Hobbes and Competition:**
- Negative consequences of competition described as a race leading to mutual oppression
- Fear of death and struggle for worldly precedence are all that remains in Hobbes' universe
- Absolute state needed to "break the amor sui" and control human desire.

**Spinoza and Mimetic Desire:**
- Link between imitation and emotion: we conceive others feeling emotions, we are affected similarly
- Imitation of emotions refers to compassion or emulation (desire for something because others desire it)
- Human desire for material objects reinforced or impaired by imitation
- Striving for mimetic confirmation of desire can lead to reciprocal hatred and envy.

**Spinoza's Propositions on Desire:**
- Prop.: By conceiving that someone loves/desires something, we are more steadfast in our own emotions regarding it
- Note: Everyone endeavors to have others follow their own disposition; this leads to ambition and conflict
- Prop.: If we conceive someone taking delight in something they can possess alone, we will try to prevent them from gaining it
- Note: Envy and pity are two imitative emotions arising from human nature.

**Spinoza's Influence on Literature:**
- Goethe's reference to Spinoza's philosophy as significant in understanding his own experiences with desire and jealousy (Werther)
- Goethe's obsession with his rival, Merck, provided firsthand experience of the "dangers" of seeking confirmation of one's own desire through another person.


#### Rousseau's Amour-propre: Mimetic Desire and Self-Love in Society

**Goethe's Knowledge and Spinoza's Philosophy**
- Goethe's knowledge gained from experience converges with Spinoza's philosophical discourse on the connection between imitation and emotion

**Jean-Jacques Rousseau**
- Recognizes mimetic passions of vanity, pride, and envy as phenomena shaping the modern world
- Describes **amour-propre**: a competitive self-love based on comparison with others, in contrast to **amour de soi** (self-assured love)
- Sees amour-propre as the basis for mimetic desire and the emergence of societal inequality and vice
- Links amour-propre to public esteem and the "race" for reputation, honors, and preferment
- Contrasts peaceful man of nature with competitive self-love in society
- Sees autonomous self-love as positive in the natural condition of man, unlike Christian tradition's view of pride and fall of man

**Rousseau vs. Mimetic Theory**
- Rousseau's idea of the asocial man of nature is a product of romantic striving for individual autonomy, leading to mimetic desire
- Rousseau's positive self-love of man in nature corresponds to his own yearning for quasi-divine self-sufﬁciency
- Girard's stance differs from Rousseau's on the deeper causes of man's destructive competitive disposition, seeing it rooted in Original Sin.


#### Exploring the ambivalent role of desire in Rousseau and Kant's philosophies.

**Mimetic Desire and Romantic Individuality**

**Comparison between Dostoyevsky and Rousseau**:
- Both on the brink of romantic self-divinization
- Dostoyevsky able to overcome seduction of autonomy in portrayal of mimetic desire as self-destructive phenomenon
- Rousseau unable to abandon romantic individuality, ultimately struck by madness

**Rousseau's Mimetic Theory**:
- Recognizes imitation as integral human trait representing essential difference from animals
- Human beings in state of nature compensate for lacking instincts through imitation
- "Natural pity" (compassion) driven by capacity for identification, accessible to all living beings
- Source of both positive and negative manifestations of desire

**Problems with Rousseau's Anthropology**:
- Only references positive manifestations of mimesis in nature, not malevolent passions
- Claims innocence of man's natural state based on lack of destructive passions as a child
- Diverges from Augustine and Christian doctrine of Original Sin
- Overlooks structural identity and risks of mimetic sense

**Kant's View on Envy**:
- Recognizes significance of envy, offers harsh critique
- Awareness of comparative nature and mimetic roots
- Not only negative assessment.


#### Kant's perspective on envy: healthy emulation and human coexistence.

**Kant's View on Envy and Emulation**
- Kant considers envy as part of human nature, not completely condemned
- Viewed as "indirectly malignant" and sometimes positive
- Envy represents healthy emulation in human coexistence
- Importance given to self-love that involves comparison, which can lead to jealousy and rivalry
- Human nature is intrinsically problematic, with unsociable sociability leading to cultural advancement
- Comparison of human beings to trees that grow "stunted, crooked and awry"

**Kant's Analysis of Envy and Rivalry**
- Incompatibility, begrudging and competitive vanity, insatiable desire to possess or dominate are necessary for cultural development
- From a Christian perspective, Kant's praise of "begrudging and competitive vanity" raises reservations
- Similarities with Goethe's Faust: Mephistopheles as part of the force that always wills evil but produces good
- Kant ignores doubts and justifies interpersonal antagonism as belonging to divine order

**Max Scheler's Analysis of Envy and Mimesis**
- Insightful analyses of mimetic nature of envy
- Emphasis on significance of comparison in human relations
- Criticized by Girard for inconsistently focusing on the object of desire, rather than the mediator or rival
- Ontological longing for another person's being only emerges under exceptional circumstances among great humans.

**Mimesis and Desire for Recognition**
- The decreasing distance between subject and object increases potential for conflict
- Brothers, sisters, neighbors more likely to become enemies than unrelated strangers
- Insight found in Girard's writings as well as those of many other thinkers on human antagonism
- Example: Hans Magnus Enzensberger's essay "Civil War" portrays contemporary world as macrocosmic civil war.


#### Exploring human conflict through Hegel's concept of recognition and its relation to mimetic desire.

**Enzensberger's Essay on Civil War**

**Importance of Enzensberger's Essay**:
- Sees contemporary civil war as an original and perpetual form of human conflict, not just a passing phenomenon
- Argues that violence within the group precedes any outward manifestation of violence

**Hegel's Influence on Enzensberger's Thought**:
- Enzensberger draws on Hegel's assumption that society's original state is a mutual struggle for recognition
- Sees the "longing for recognition" as a fundamental anthropological fact

**Comparison to Carl Schmitt**:
- Both argue that civil war is a primary form of collective conflict, preceding wars between nations
- Schmitt's enemy is "the other, the stranger", while Enzensberger focuses on rivalry within close proximity

**Hegel and Mimetic Desire**:
- In the Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel handles the concept of recognition, parallel to Girard's mimetic desire
- Kojève's interpretation of Hegel is influential, particularly for Girard's early formulations on mimetic desire


#### Human Desire and Recognition: Hegel's Master-Slave Dialectic and Historical Development.

**Anthropogenetic Desire and Self-Consciousness**

**Human Desire vs. Animal Desire**:
- Human desire is directed towards another's desire, leading to the creation of human history
- This "desire for recognition" is a function of self-consciousness
- Hegel sees desire as rooted in negation and annihilation

**The Struggle for Recognition**:
- Multiple desires lead to a "life and death fight" for dominance
- The master is the victor, while the slave is bound to labor but develops self-consciousness

**Ideological Development of Slavery**:
- Stoicism, skepticism, and "unhappy consciousness" (linked to pre-Reformation Christianity)
- Slaves' yearning for overcoming alienation leads to political emancipation and the end of history

**Kojève's Interpretations**:
- Replaced Napoleon with Stalin in the 1930s, then later argued the United States, modern Japan, and European Union represented the ultimate embodiment of universal recognition

**Fukuyama's "The End of History and the Last Man"**:
- Explores whether liberal democracy is the final form of government


#### Discussion on Hegel's theory of recognition and its relationship to Fukuyama's End of History thesis, with critiques from Girard and Enzensberger.

**Fukuyama's Thesis: End of History**
- Fukuyama argues that political and economic liberalism (democracy and free market capitalism) has experienced universal triumph around the world
- This progression towards political democracy is not solely based on economic grounds
- Market-oriented authoritarian states can achieve the same economic results as liberal democracies, but are unable to satisfy man's need for recognition
- Liberal democracy is the only political structure capable of enabling universal recognition
- The desire for recognition plays a central role in Fukuyama's book and links his thesis to the previous section on mimetic passions at the dawn of modern era
- Fukuyama equates Hobbes' vainglory, Rousseau's amour propre, and Hegel's "desire for another's desire" as leading to Kant's depiction of man's "asocially social" condition

**Critiques of Fukuyama's Thesis**
- Enzensberger rejects the plausibility of Fukuyama's "End of History" thesis
- Every community creates inequalities, slights, injustices, unreasonable demands, and frustrations that fuel the need for recognition
- The more freedom and equality people gain, the more they expect, and if these expectations are not fulfilled, anyone can feel humiliated
- Fukuyama acknowledges such arguments in reference to Nietzsche's warning of the "last man"
- From a mimetic theory perspective, Fukuyama's counterarguments are stronger than his main thesis

**René Girard's Perspective on Hegel and Mimetic Desire**
- Girard criticizes Hegel's (and Marxist successors') proclamation of the end of history
- Humans will find ways to transform their vanity and snobbism, their mimetic desire, into new possibilities for conflict even without physical violence
- In Quand ces choses commenceront, Girard distances himself from Fukuyama's thesis
- Mimetic desire differs fundamentally from Hegel's concept of the "desire for another's desire"
- Negation and annihilation are a constituent aspect of Hegel's thought, while Girard's system allows for the overcoming of these consequences
- Hegel's assumption of the master-slave dialectic at the advent of human history is ultimately unpersuasive
- Girard's concept of mimesis provides a logical development of human desire that converges with Hegel's observations.


#### Theory of Mimetic Desire: Girard vs. Kojève's Interpretation of Hegel and Dostoyevsky

**Girard's Theory vs. Hegel's Concept of Recognition**

**Differences:**
- Triangular structure of desire in Girard vs. bipolar structure in Hegel
- Accounts for non-violent desires in Girard

**Kojève's Interpretation of Hegel and Christianity:**
- Follows Feuerbach and Marx: Hegel's philosophy as "secularized Christian theology"
- References to Christ in Phenomenology are to Napoleon or Hegel, not God
- Christianity characterized as last stage of servitude, must be overcome by wisdom
- Human freedom achieved through contemplation of mortality

**Girard's Position:**
- Religious vision aligned with Dostoyevsky
- Recognizes destructive potential in human pride and autonomy attempts
- Identifies parallels between Kojève's Napoleon, "revealed God," or Hegel's Phenomenology and characters like Kirilov from Demons
- Traces development of desire from acquisitive mimeticism to the desire for recognition

**Mimetic Behavior in Animals:**
- Mimesis present in all forms of life, particularly higher mammals and humans
- Manifestation of spectacular forms in "so-called higher mammals" and man's nearest relatives.


#### Mimetic desire: Imitation leads to conflict and transformation of objects.

**Mimetic Desire**

**Background:**
- Imitation linked to acquisitive behavior and empathy in animals (de Waal)
- Primary mimetism: unconscious imitation leading to conflict over objects (Girard)
  - Preceding consciousness, language or symbols
  - Quasi-osmotic immediacy

**Examples of Imitation:**
- Female guppies following each other's mate choices
- Octopus learning from another octopus's attacks

**Primary Mimetism and Conflict:**
- Role model prevents subject from acquiring object
- Increased desire and resistance leading to reinforced value of object
- Metamorphosis into a "metaphysical" or "hyper-real" object

**Metaphysical Desire:**
- Objects lose connection to original value
- Examples: Don Quixote's golden helmet, crystallization in romantic passion (Stendhal)
  - Mimetic rivalry turns simple objects into coveted fetishes

**Marx's Perspective:**
- Fetishism of commodities as a result of capitalist society (Marx)
- Metamorphosis of objects is a fundamental issue concerning human coexistence (Girard)

**Mimetic Desire Stages:**
1. Primary mimetism: unconscious imitation leading to conflict
2. Metaphysical desire: object loses connection to original value, becomes fetish.


#### Mimetic desire: the pursuit of empty prestige through violent conflict and fetishized resistance

**Mimetic Desire and Prestige:**
* Rivalry over prestige can be more virulent than real object rivalries (Girard)
* Metaphysical objects result from mimetic rivalry (Girard)
* Central importance of human struggle for recognition or prestige in conﬂict (Kojève, Hobbes)
* Examples: Hamlet's soliloquy, Falklands War, ethnic divisions
* Nothingness at heart of ambition leads to bloody wars

**Insights from Shakespeare:**
* Hamlet's soliloquy on the human capacity for thought and reason
* Fighting over prestige and honor: empty and meaningless from an outside perspective but everything to the rivals

**Properties of Mimetic Desire:**
* Desire is characterized by inner dynamic rooted in self-reflexivity (Girard)
* Intensified by resistance of original model (Girard)
* Resistance increases value of object and shifts focus to pursuit of resistance itself
* Fetishism of violence emerges: model reinforces subject's original desire through own resistance.

**Mimetic Desire and Prestige:**
* Mimetism leads from automatic imitation to rivalry based on prestige (Girard)
* Two opponents face off in a fight over nonexistent objects
* Rivalry is self-perpetuating, increasing in simplicity and fervor (Girard).


#### Mimetic Desire: Imitation, Rivalry, and Double Mediation in Interdividual Psychology

**Girard's Interpretation of Masochism and Mimetic Desire**

**Concepts Rejected**:
- Essentialist interpretation of masochism and desire

**Origins of Masochism**:
- Mimesis of the model's resistance to original desire
- Not a natural desire for pain, defeat, or violence

**Metaphysical Desire**:
- Tends toward (pseudo-)masochism
- Superordinate to sadism
- Arises from imitation of model's violence directed at the self

**Model Transformation**:
- Attraction based on possession of the object and its value
- Object and model become one, fascination extends beyond desire for object

**Model-Obstacle**:
- Model becomes divine and diabolical in advanced stages of mimetic desire
- Adoration and hatred towards the model

**Kafka's Parable Before the Law**:
- Illustrates the concept of the model-obstacle

**Ambivalence and Double Bind**:
- Similar to Freud's concept of ambivalence
- Identical to Gregory Bateson's "double bind" (ignoring focus on pathological cases)

**Double Mimesis or Mediation**:
- In advanced stages of mimetic desire, imitation is extremely contagious
- Model may begin to imitate the original subject's desire

**Example: The Sorrows of Young Werther**:
- Goethe's parable illustrating double imitation between Werther and Albert over Lotte

**Example: The Red and the Black**:
- Mimetic rivalry between Mayor Rênal and Director V alenod over tutor Julien Sorel
- Double mediation leading to imitative desire in both subjects.


### 4. The Scapegoat Mechanism as Origin of Culture

**The Scapegoat Mechanism as Origin of Culture**

**Sigmund Freud's Perspective**:
- Brute force is overcome by union
- "Right" (law) is the violence of a community, quick to attack individuals who stand in its path

**Girard's Theory of Culture**:
- The second part of Girard's theory posits that human culture emerged from a founding murder
- The first forms of civilization were generated by collective deterrence of violence in archaic crisis situations

**Mimetic Crisis and the Monstrous Double**:
- Mimesis in intense stages carries extreme potential for contagious proliferation
- Spatial, social, and mental proximity of humans transforms mimetic rivalry into a sickness that can spread through a community like a plague
- The symbol of the plague represents the threat of social collapse from violent proliferation of mimesis

**Scapegoat as Origin of Culture**:
- **Mimetic Crisis**: Disorder caused by consequences of violent mimesis
- **Sacrificial Crisis**: Disorder caused by failure or disappearance of sacrificial rituals
- **Crisis of Distinctions**: Concrete and visible consequences of cultural breakdown

**Examples of Mimetic Crisis**:
- **Oedipus the King (Sophocles)**: Plague threatens to destroy Thbes, symbolizing social crisis
- **Heinrich von Kleist's "The Earthquake in Chile"**: Prisoner Jeronimo's cell survives earthquake, foreshadowing destruction of entire city


#### Natural and social chaos described through earthquakes, plagues, and conflicts in literature.

**Natural Disasters and Social Chaos: Impact on Society (Kleist, Dostoyevsky, Storm, Shakespeare)**

**Earthquake (Kleist)**
- Jeronimo flees city during earthquake
- Natural violence inseparable from social chaos
  - Collapse of nature leads to dissolution of social differences
  - Men and women of all classes affected
  - Social chaos: looting, crime, disorder

**Plague (Dostoyevsky)**
- Raskolnikov's dream about a pestilence that spreads worldwide
- Human relations engulfed by mutually imitated violence
  - Infected men believe their judgments and convictions are infallible
  - Communities disagree on what is good or evil, kill each other senselessly
  - Disagreement leads to the breakdown of labor and social order

**The Dykemaster (Storm)**
- Strange form of vermin falls from sky before storm and Haien's death
- Plague composed of insects and blood
- Conflict not between man and nature, but among villagers

**Social Hierarchy and Violence (Girard)**
- Collapse of social hierarchy allows for spread of violent mimesis
  - Rigid hierarchies prevent the spread of conflict and violence by restricting desire to external mediation.

**Troilus and Cressida (Shakespeare)**
- Crisis within Greek military camp before success against Troy
- Achilles challenges Agamemnon, conﬂict threatens hierarchy
- Ulysses recognizes the importance of social degrees in maintaining order.


#### Tragedy's symmetrical exploration of rivalry and violence in ancient Greek literature.

**Social Differences and Mimetically Induced Crisis in Shakespeare's Ulysses Speech**

**Background:**
- Quote from Ulysses' speech in Shakespeare's play
- Warnings against eradicating social differences
- Imitation as cause of crisis

**Dangers of Eradicating Social Differences**
- Chaos ensues when degree is disregarded (Agamemnon's disdain)
- Every step follows suit in emulation fever
- Envious fear and pale, bloodless emulation
- Plagues, portents, mutiny, natural disasters follow

**Mimetic Desire and Crisis Proliferation**
- Equality leads to intense rivalry (violent crisis)
- Rivals become enemy brothers
- Violence exchanged rapidly: victor becomes vanquished
- Reciprocal relationship between protagonists

**Ancient Tragedy**
- Tragedians' insight into identical nature of rivals
- Symmetrical pattern in plot, form, and language
- Blurred divisions between good and evil
- Constant reciprocity in relationships

**Emergence of Monsters (Intensification of Mimetic Crisis)**
- Rapid exchange of violence between rivals
- From an external perspective: enemy brothers
- For the rivals: confusion and blurred differences.


#### Mimetic Crisis: Monsters and Reciprocal Desire in A Midsummer Night's Dream. Shakespearean drama illustrating the emergence of monstrous hallucinations during intense desire and rivalry.

**Mimetic Crisis in A Midsummer Night's Dream (Shakespeare)**

**Description of Mimetic Crisis:**
- Rapid sequence of reciprocation leads to blurred passage of moments
- Formless and grotesque mixture of things that are normally separate
- Monsters emerge with divine, human, and animal attributes

**Helena's Relationship with Hermia:**
- Helena divinizes Hermia as her model
- See herself as "ugly as a bear" in comparison
- Lysander and Demetrius lose interest in Hermia
- Helena is now perceived as "goddess, nymph, perfect, divine"

**Helena's Relationship with Demetrius:**
- Demetrius divinizes Helena as his object of desire
- Helena becomes his "spaniel" and "used as you use your dog"
- Reciprocal violence replaces object of desire

**Mimetic Crisis in the Drama:**
- Characters exchange positions rapidly
- Divine, animal, and human imagery appear
- Monsters emerge with random combinations of attributes

**Girard's Perspective:**
- Outside perspective sees identical nature of enemies (doubles)
- Inside perspective produces image of monsters
- Rival characters distracted by hallucination of monsters
- Doubles possess monstrous qualities under the surface.


#### Mimetic Crisis and Scapegoat Mechanism: Girard's Perspective on Violence and Human Society

**Girard's Concept of the Monstrous Double**
- Refers to phenomena provoked at height of mimetic crisis by unrecognized reciprocity (Violence and the Sacred, 164; De la violence à la divinité, 496)

**Obsession and Masks**
- When mimetic crisis reaches monstrous double stage: subject experiences itself and rival as monster
- Interprets extreme self-perception as originating from outside itself (quasi-hysterical mimesis)
- Masks in archaic cultures unify gods, man, and inanimate objects; recreate situations during mimetic crisis
- Masks and monstrous double are one and the same

**Crisis and Natural State**
- Mimetic desire can lead to violent confl ict if not checked by cultural order institutions
- Postulated that there were actual mimetic crises at onset of civilization, transforming society into chaos (Girard, Hobbes)

**Scapegoat Mechanism**
- At climax of mimetic crisis: violence of all against all pervades community, leading to mass delirium and collective effervescent
- Aside from reciprocal annihilation, reconciliatory mimesis can overcome social crisis (mythical texts, archaic rituals)
- Reconciliatory mimesis: disappearance of concrete objects of desire replaced by reciprocal rivalry and violence
- Order arises from extreme disorder as collective hatred directed at single victim (scapegoat)


#### Scapegoat Mechanism: Unconscious Transfer of Guilt in Religion and Society (Girard)

**Girard's Concept of Scapegoat Mechanism**

**Background:**
- Girard refers to scapegoating as a mechanism of surrogate victim or victimage mechanism
- Originates from the biblical ritual in Leviticus (16)
- Modern understanding: someone blamed for others' mistakes or sins unconsciously

**Characteristics:**
- Unconscious psychological phenomenon
- Perpetrators unaware they are transferring guilt and responsibility onto the victim
- Double transference: scapegoat embodies both negative aggression and positive reconciliation
- Divinization of the victim, creating a religious experience for the persecutors

**Impact on Religion:**
- Origin of archaic religions
- Myths depict violence from perpetrators' perspective
- Rituals: controlled repetition of scapegoat mechanism restoring peace and unity in the community.


#### Mimetic Crisis and Scapegoat Mechanism in Mythology: Oedipus and Earthquake in Chile

**Scapegoating: A Mechanism for Crisis Resolution**

**Function of Taboos and Prohibitions**:
- Prevent new outbursts of social crisis
- Absolute forbidden crimes are the cause of the original crisis

**Archaic Religions**:
- Originate from innerworldly misinterpretation of victimage mechanism
- Strictly divergent from transcendental God of Bible
- Mob believes controlled by external, transcendent power
- In reality, mob is possessed by collective violence

**Girard's Analysis of Mythical Texts**:
- Traces of scapegoat mechanism found in myths and literature
- Oedipus the King (Sophocles) example:
  - Deadly plague threatens Thebes, leads to search for responsible party
  - Rivalry between Oedipus, Creon, and Tiresias
  - Oedipus accused of being unjust ruler by Creon
  - All unite against Oedipus as scapegoat for plague crisis
- Scapegoat mechanism present in reverse form in "Earthquake in Chile"
  - Innocent man hanged after rescuing people from burning house
  - Donna Josephe functions as community's quasi-divine founding mother
  - Concluding scene: Jeronimo, Josephe, and followers lynched for causing original earthquake


#### Scapegoat Mechanism in Literature: Myths and Narratives of Collective Violence

**Scapegoat Mechanism in Literature: Examples from Kleist, Dostoyevsky, and Philostratus**

**Kleist's "The Marble Girl": Jeronimo's Fate**
- Haunting description of the mob's violence against Jeronimo, Josephe, woman, and infant
- Shrouded in myth and reversal narrative
- Scapegoat mechanism present in the death sentence against protagonists and earthquake's effect on survivors

**Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment": Raskolnikov's Dream**
- Plague drives world into violence: all against a few, foundation of new human race
- Scapegoat mechanism depicted in form of reversal

**Storm's "The Dykemaster": Haien's Suicide**
- Hauke Haien responsible for ﬂood that threatens village
- Inability to cope with collective accusation leads to suicide
- Haien becomes haunted spirit, turns into protector of villagers
- Elements of positive transformation of scapegoat

**Romulus: Founder of Rome and Scapegoat God**
- Sudden disappearance of Romulus during public sacrifice in Quirinal Hill
- Mythical account: ascended to heaven, became god Quirinus
- Historical accounts suggest connection to collective violence and scapegoat mechanism

**Apollonius of Tyana: The Ephesus Plague**
- Miracle worker called upon to end plague in Ephesus
- Demands Ephesians stone an old beggar, believed to be a demon
- Collective execution enabling unity among the mob and sharing responsibility for victim's death.


#### Scapegoat mechanism in literature: Lord of the Flies and mythology

**Scapegoating and Collective Behavior: Traces of Ephesians and Lord of the Flies**

**Ephesians' Reverence for Victim:**
- Stoning site becomes a memorial to gods
- No real divinization of victim, but a "pale form of myth" (Girard)

**Philostratus' Account:**
- Describes origin of proper myths with complete divinization of victim

**Lord of the Flies by William Golding:**
- Contemporary literature example showcasing inner social-psychological processes in scapegoat mechanism
- Group dynamics:
  - Rivalries resolved through scapegoating
  - "Closed circuit of sympathy" formed against victim

**Novel's Scenes:**
1. Boys exchange names, Jack attacks corpulent boy (Piggy) and Ralph imitates
2. Hunters reconcile with enemy (Piggy) through scapegoating dance
3. Group mistakes Simon for dangerous animal, kills him during dance

**Girard's Theory:**
- Scapegoat mechanism unites group at expense of single victim
- Tension relieved within the group
- Mimetic crisis precedes collective murder (contradicting Freud)
- Ritual is a controlled repetition of original victimage mechanism, not a product of guilt.


#### Sacrifice as a Unifying Element in Ancient Cultures: Scapegoat Theory and Rituals

**Jensen's Idea of the "Murdered Divinity"**
- Jensen discovered a central idea among plant cultures: sacrificial victims, ripeness and fertility cults, etc. are not random, but derive from a central concept - the "murdered divinity"
- The divine being was killed at the beginning of the community, then bestowed propagation on humans and plants
- Jensen could not explain why this "central idea" was so prevalent among plant cultures or why the victim was seen as the "murdered divinity"

**Hocart's Theories on Ritual and Political Institutions**
- English anthropologist Arthur Maurice Hocart studied the connection between ritual and political institutions
- Found that the two were correlated, but could not genetically explain their development
- Believed sacrilege was the unifying essence of rituals
- Lucien Scubla used Girard's mimetic theory to better understand Hocart's observations

**Burkert's Perspective on the Sacred in Greek Antiquity**
- German philologist Walter Burkert focused on ancient Greek history
- Described the sacred as directly connected to sacrificial killing
- Coined the term "homo religious acts and attains self-awareness as homo necans" - man the killer
- Detailed description of Greek sacrifices, where participants marked off a sacred circle and washed their hands before making aggressive gestures and throwing grains at the animal


#### Religious rituals and scapegoat mechanism: Girard vs social contract theory

**Collective Aggression and the Sacred**
* Group's "aggressive sprinkling of barley grains" and "piercing scream" symbolize:
  * Collective unloading of aggression
  * Experience of the sacred
* Parallels with Girard's hypothesis of scapegoat mechanism

**Mircea Eliade on Religious Rituals**
* Not to be understood solely from present examination
* Objective is returning humans to primeval moment
* Orgy: chaos leading to new order, abolishing past and restoring primeval illud tempus
  * Overthrowing social conditions
  * Combining opposites
  * Suspension of all norms
* Merging forms corresponds to Girard's description of the sacrificial crisis
* Creativity in founding myths: Eliade speaks of "creative murders"
* Lack of universal explanation for why rituals must continually restage original crisis

**Girard's Critique of Social Contract Theory**
* Modern notion that societal institutions emanate from social contract is incongruous with mimetic theory
* Emphasis on religious origins of the Social (des Sozialen)
* Historical rejection of social contract as origin of state
* Traces of scapegoat mechanism found in classical formulations of concept

**Thomas Hobbes**
* Arguments against the thesis that mimetic crisis could be solved by human reason find parallels in his work
* All contracts are fragile and unstable without central governing power
* Solution: Establishing authority to render all future contracts stable.


#### The origins of society, religion, and culture rooted in the scapegoat mechanism.

**Hobbes' Fear of God and Social Contract**
- **Fear of God as a source of stability**: Before civic society, only the fear of an "Invisible Power" can enforce peace agreements against temptations
- **Religious oaths**: Swearing by God to uphold contracts; Romans' oath between Alba Longa and Romans involved sacrificing a pig
- Traces of scapegoat mechanism in these religious rites: Sacrificed pig represents penalty for future contract breakers
- Ferire: Latin verb meaning both "to reach agreement" and "to punch, hit, kill, slaughter"

**Rousseau's Social Contract**
- **General Will**: Quasi-religious concept of unity in Rousseauian theory
- Emphasis on religious reinforcement of political unity: Call for civil religion promoting social sentiments
- Central role of religious oaths in Rousseau's system: Sworn during the conclusion of social contracts
- Connection between religion and society: Durkheim's emphasis on this connection
- Exclusion of scapegoat logic in Rousseau's thoughts on the nature of society: General Will is not just a summation of individual wills but transcends them.

**Scapegoat Mechanism as Origin of Culture and Social Differences**
- Scapegoat mechanism gives rise to fundamental social differences, including the division between profane and sacred in archaic religion
- God is the sacrificial victim, religious community is profane
- Victimage mechanism divides time into a "before" (time of crisis) and an "after" (time of social peace)


#### Sacred spaces and the origin of culture through sacrifice and violence.

**Archaic Space and Cultural Differences:**
* **Creation of Archaic Space**: Represents division between "outside" and "inside," represented by victim and community respectively.
* **Origins of Cultural Differences**: Violent origins, such as Cain's murder of Abel or the Vedic Purusha myth.
	+ Creation of cities and division of labor from founding murders.
	+ Essential social differences originate from "Cosmic Sacrifice" in Vedic mythology.
* **Heraclitus' Description of War**: Culture formed on the basis of violence and sacrifice.

**Scapegoat Mechanism and Cultural Order:**
* **Role of Scapegoat**: Establishes cultural order through violent acts or sacrificial rituals.
	+ Foundational murder imposes its image on community structures, creating a sense of orientation.
* **Examples of Archaic Spaces**: Greek sites dedicated to unity, such as tombs of heroes, omphalos, agora, and Hestia.
	+ Sacred spaces give birth to religious forms and fix spatial relationships.

**Science of Religion and Sacred Space:**
* **Mircea Eliade's Works**: Archaic conceptions of space interconnected with religious experience through the demarcation between sacred and profane space.
	+ Sacrilege brings about building sacrifice as a ritual imitation of "original sacrifice."
* **Modern Political Debate on Space**: Calls for new understanding of significance of space in political order, with references to archaic concepts and founding violence.

**Building Sacrifice:**
* **Concept**: Belief that construction projects require sacrificial victims for lasting stability.
	+ Originated from graves for stoned victims (first pyramids).
* **Mimetic Theory's Perspective**: Controlled repetition of founding murder, bringing unity and peace through corresponding sacrifices during building projects.


#### Building Sacrifice: Ancient Cultural Practice in Literature and Religion. Examples from various cultures and texts, including the Bible and German literature.

**The Significance of Building Sacrifice in Culture**
* The tomb serves as the first cultural symbol and foundation of civilization (Things Hidden, 83)
* Ritual sacrifice at construction beginnings is a universal phenomenon (every culture, continent, history)
* Example from Indian legend: Ganga Bhavani's request for a human sacrifice to fix dam rupture in the Ganges (Klusmann)
* Ancient literature illustrates building sacriﬁce in Roman texts and Bible (Romulus' murder, Joshua's curse on Jericho)
* European traditions include North German legend of children being thrown into dam openings
* Contemporary examples: India (1968), Peru, Austrian daily newspaper (Tiroler Tageszeitung)

**Literary Exemplifications**
* The Dykemaster by Theodor Storm: Modern rationalistic figure opposes archaic community's religious custom of sacrificing a child or animal during dam construction
	+ Hauke Haien saves dog from being thrown into ditch, confronts workers about the practice
	+ Wife warns him of potential demand for human sacrifice during process of dam's construction
	+ Haien ultimately throws himself into ﬂood as a sacriﬁce to ensure dyke's stability
* Joseph and His Brothers by Thomas Mann: Ancient mythical thinking is reconstructed; reference to human sacriﬁce in foundation of one household (Laban and Adina)
	+ Laban and wife Adina had no sons, sacrificed their early-born child for blessings but received none.


#### Discussing the scapegoat mechanism in mythology: Girard vs. Lévi-Strauss. Girard argues for historical basis, Lévi-Strauss sees structural parallels but disconnects from reality.

**Building Sacrifice: Global Phenomenon Explained by Mimetic Theory**

**Biblical Dissolution of Myth**
- Alludes to biblical thinking leading to overcoming archaic religiosity (Girard)
- Scapegoat mechanism uncovered in the Bible

**Mimetic Theory and Myth Interpretation**
- Sacriﬁce portrayed in myths as global phenomenon
- Necessitates all-encompassing theory for explanation
- Mimetic theory meets this challenge, superior to other approaches

**Girard's Interpretation of Myth**
- Myths: oral accounts or written texts that distort real acts of violence against victims (Th e Scapegoat)
- Foundational to understanding scapegoat mechanism
- Historical core to mythical accounts, contrasting modern scholars' views

**Structuralism vs. Historical Analysis in Interpreting Myth**
- Two fundamental tendencies: devaluation and rehabilitation of myth
- Positivists see myth as illusory products, rational thought sufficient (outdated)
- Increasing reference to intrinsic meaning and value in contemporary debate
- Lévi-Strauss's structuralism argues "savage mind" possesses quality surpassing scientific thought
- No historical reality attributed to mythical accounts according to structuralism.

**Myths: Oral Accounts of Foundational Violence**
- Myths from different cultures share themes of expelling a god to establish cultural order (Ojibwa, Tikopia)
- Structural parallels between these myths emphasized by Lévi-Strauss
- Radical elimination of elements brings about system of difference and order in structuralism's perspective
- Expulsion of the god is seen as a mere reflection on abstract origin of human thought, disconnected from real event.


#### Comparing ritual and myth interpretations: Structuralism vs Mimetic Theory, with focus on Aztec culture.

**Lévi-Strauss vs. Girard on Ritual and Myth:**

**Lévi-Strauss's Perspective**:
- Ritual represents an attempt to regain undifferentiated immediacy in opposition to mythical thought
- Rituals are a "bastardization of thought" brought about by the constraints of life
- Structuralists argue that ritual and myth cannot be separated based on categories of nondifferentiation and differentiation

**Girard's Perspective**:
- Ritual and myth share similarities, rooted in the same mechanism - the founding violence
- Rituals can provide insight into the origins of myths as they offer a clearer presentation of collective murder than myths

**Hassler's Interpretation of Aztec Myths**:
- Argues that the Aztecs did not practice human sacrifice based on historical sources
- Believes depictions of violent deities and myths should be understood symbolically, not literally
- Denies that metaphors, symbols, allegories have a basis in reality

**Girard's Counterargument**:
- Metaphor and figurative speech are based on reality; denying human sacrifice in Aztec myths is absurd
- In the Aztec creation myth, gods sacrificing themselves can be seen as an enactment of sacrificial rituals

**Historical Context**:
- Hassler's interpretation is typical of the predominant trend in contemporary ethnology
- Girard's theory has met with skepticism despite unequivocal evidence of human sacrifice in the Andes

**Girard's Approach to Myth Interpretation**:
- Uses historical analysis, not objected to connection between texts and historical reality
- Analyzes medieval texts of persecution, which are based on actual acts of violence despite their distorted accounts


#### Analyzing persecution texts: Crisis, accusation, selection of victims, violence in Oedipus myth and medieval Jewish persecutions.

**Interpreting Texts of Persecution: Girard's Methodology**

**Elements of Persecution Texts:**
- **Stereotype of crisis**: Signs of societal dissolution leading to a collapse of cultural order (e.g., hail storms, plague)
- **Stereotype of accusation**: Blaming victims for causing crisis through acts of violence, sexual crimes, or sacrilege
- **Stereotype of selection of victims/signs of victimization**: Certain groups targeted as scapegoats due to religious/cultural distinctions, physical attributes, gender, lack of protection, or prominent positions
- **Stereotype of violence**: Acts of real violence against falsely accused victims, aimed at ending the crisis

**Machaut's Text:**
1. Real violence against Jews: desire to exterminate them
2. Crisis (plague) is real
3. False accusations: Jews poison wells and cause plague
4. Banishment or murder of Jews as a solution

**Oedipus Myth:**
1. Raging plague in Thebes forms the stereotype of crisis
2. Oedipus faces charges of regicide, patricide, incest: stereotype of accusation
3. Characteristics of victim: orphan turned king with a limp, stranger to city, walked with a limp
4. Blinding and banishment of Oedipus as stereotype of violence

**Girard's Interpretation:**
- Real violence against a victim falsely accused of causing a real crisis forms the foundation of myth
- Method can be used for most myth interpretations: at least two stereotypes present to establish basis.

**Criticism and Response:**
- Some skepticism towards applying this method to myths from contemporary ethnologists
- Girard provides rewritten version of Oedipus myth as a text of persecution for better understanding.


#### Aztec creation myth: Scapegoat gods Teotihuacan, Tecuciztecatl, Nanauatzin, fire ordeal.

**Mythological Crystallization and Interpretation of Myths vs. Texts of Persecution**

**The Scapegoat Mechanism:**
- In mythology, collective aggression against a single victim (scapegoat) is more pronounced than in texts of persecution
- Physical and moral monstrosity intrinsic to portrayal of scapegoat
- Guilt belongs to the victim as a quasi-ontological attribute
- Scapegoat's presence in community brings about crisis spread

**Negative Transference (Collective Aggression):**
- In myth, the accused is one with their crimes
- Mythical narrative hides actual violence, making interpretation difficult
- Sacred elements make uncovering of violence more complex

**Positive Transference:**
- In texts of persecution, positive transference (sacred) is less present or absent entirely
- Scapegoats portrayed directly as such without the sacred elements
- Easier to see through texts of persecution

**Aztec Creation Myth:**
- Téotihuacan myth: God named Tecuciztecatl volunteered to light the world
- All gods deliberated on who would be the other, none dared offer themselves
- Pustule-covered god Nanauatzin was chosen unwillingly
- Both gods performed penances for four days
- Eventually, only Nanauatzin threw himself into the fire and became the source of light.


### 5. Biblical Revelation and Christianity

**Biblical Revelation and Christianity**

**Third Stage of Mimetic Theory**
- Girard's analysis focuses on writings of biblical revelation
- Differences from mythical perspective: texts represent scapegoats, not lynch mobs

**Comparison with Myths vs. Bible**
- James G. Frazer: many parallels between religions and Judeo-Christian tradition
- Comparative analysis of scapegoat rituals in Sacaea and biblical accounts (Matthew 27:26–31, Dio Chrysostom)
- Girard rejects Frazer's approach as missing the unique nature of biblical texts

**Nietzsche's Contribution**
- Essential contribution to understanding difference between myth and Bible
- Dionysos versus "The Cruciﬁed" (1888 aphorism)
  - Parallels: both deal with martyrdom, collective violence against a single victim
  - Central diff erence: Myth justifies sacrifice, Gospels stress innocence of victim and attack injustice
- Nietzsche's position: Bible brings about destruction of culture by enchanting egoism to an extreme.

**Girard's Perspective**
- Agrees with Nietzsche on central diff erence between Myth and Bible
- Identifies as "kind of contrarian or anti-Nietzsche" regarding the Bible
- Supports Gospel positions.


#### Old Testament's ambiguous relation to ancient myth: Fall of Man and God's paradoxical law.

**Nietzsche and Christianity: Girard's Perspective**

**Girard on Nietzsche**:
- Recognized Nietzsche's greatness for his unparalleled recognition of the truth at the heart of Christianity
- Believes Nietzsche's rejection of Christianity in favor of Dionysos led to his madness and political insanity
- Sees connection between Nietzsche's rejection and 20th century catastrophes like the Holocaust

**Girard on Max Weber**:
- Recognized Weber's praise of the singularity of the biblical tradition, particularly its partisanship with victims
- Criticizes Weber's Nietzschean stance that this revelation is based on resentment from political defeats suffered by the Jewish people

**Girard's View on Myths**:
- Sees myths as accounts of collective murder told from the perspective of the persecutors
- Believes the Bible differs fundamentally from myth because it sides with the victims of persecution

**Old Testament: The Fall of Man as Mythical Account**:
- Traces of archaic myth can be observed in Genesis stories of the Garden of Eden and the Fall of Man
- God's forbiddance to eat from the tree of knowledge is paradoxical, as it serves to justify the later punishment of Adam and Eve
- This law serves to veil the original disorder and present a newly established order represented by the law


#### Biblical accounts of violence, scapegoats, and divine intervention. Mythical elements in Old Testament stories.

**The Garden of Eden: Trees of Violent Conflict and Mythical Elements**

**Trees in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 2:9)**
- Two trees located in the middle of the garden
- The "tree of knowledge" is associated with curse, while the "tree of life" provides blessing
- Scapegoat mechanism is reflected in these trees and their moral dualism

**Mythical Elements in Biblical Texts**
- **Milomaki myth**: A boy burned at stake, his ashes becoming the first paxiuba palm tree
- **The Fall of Man (Genesis 3:1–5, 14–15)**: Serpent bears full responsibility for the Fall; God curses and expels humans from Eden
- **Mythical account in Ezekiel (28:12–19)**: Tells of a proud evil-doer in the Garden of Eden, God's judgment against him

**Cain and Abel Story (Genesis 4)**
- Difference between sacrificial offerings determines God's judgment
- Violence and the Sacred analysis: Cain is a murderer, Abel is not

**The Fate of Korah and His Followers (Numbers 16–17)**
- Mimetic rivalry over leadership leads to collective punishment
- Divine intervention appears as human projection
- Fire pans used in the sacriﬁce are sacredized, but victims' perspective is lacking

**The Binding of Isaac (Genesis)**
- Old Testament can be seen as having mythical and non-mythical texts
- "Binding of Isaac" story: Abraham was forced to off er his son as a sacrifice to God
- Represents the process of detachment from archaic practices rooted in scapegoat mechanism.


#### Biblical Fall of Man: Human Desire, Scapegoats and Renunciation of Idolatry

**Biblical Revelation and Christianity**

**Difference between Biblical Texts and Mythology:**
- **Genesis stories**: while they share some parallels with archaic myth, the biblical texts shed light on essential aspects of human coexistence and human propensity for scapegoating.
  - **The Fall of Man**: God's expulsion of man from the Garden of Eden is discussed, revealing the importance of mimetic desire (pride and envy) as the cause of sin.
    * Genesis 3:12-13: Adam blames Eve, who in turn accuses the serpent.
    * The serpent embodies human attempts to escape guilt and responsibility.
  - **The story of Cain and Abel**: while both stories involve brothers and city founding, the biblical text identifies with the innocent victim Abel and takes his side.

**Biblical Perspective on Scapegoating:**
- The Bible does not condone scapegoating or idolatry.
  - Joseph and his brothers: despite similarities to Oedipus myth, the Bible is on the side of the victim Joseph and rejects attempts to deify human beings.
  - Job: Girard's analysis using mimetic theory interprets Job as a victim of his people rather than a demonized or deified figure.

**Renunciation of Idolatry:**
- The Bible renounces idolatry, refusing to elevate human beings to divine status.
  - Joseph's rejection of his brothers' attempts to make him their lord (Genesis 50:18-19).
  - Biblical texts humanize characters like Joseph, contrasting with mythological heroes who are demonized or deified.


#### Biblical Job: Victim's perspective vs. community's perception and God's role in suffering.

**Job's Suffering: Girard's Interpretation**

**Girard's Claim**:
- The community is responsible for Job's suffering (Job 16:7–10, 18; 19:13–19; 30:1–12)
- Job is the scapegoat of his community

**Job's Friends as Persecutors**:
- Initially described as Job's consolers, they threaten him with harsh and violent words (Job 15:20–23; 20:22–29)
- Their dialogues resemble the "all against one" structure, matching Job's role as the victim of universal persecution

**Divine Violence as Projection**:
- The religious and mythological metaphors are not mere products of imagination but express unconscious collective violence against Job
- This God is "nothing but the fever of persecution that possesses the human group" (Girard, 130)

**Job's Rebellion Against Myth**:
- Job refuses to concede guilt and brings about the downfall of myth
- He is a rebel against the "God" whose human origins he is often unable to see through (Job 9:24, 32–35; 10:1–3; 13:7–8)

**True God Revealed**:
- The two central texts reveal a God who stands in defense of the victim Job and rejects the perspective of persecutors
- This true God is not a projection of collective violence but the one who recognizes Job's innocence after his death (Job 16:19–21; 19:25–27)

**Biblical Defense of Persecuted Victims**:
- Psalms of lament portray victims calling for God's support and revenge
- Second Isaiah's songs depict the Servant of Yahweh, a paradigmatic scapegoat, who is persecuted but ultimately defended (Isaiah 53:2–12)

**Mob's Conversion**:
- The persecutors accept blame for the violence, a critical difference from mythical narratives where the mob is always innocent.


#### Biblical revelation: Old and New Testaments, scapegoat mechanism, victim identification, conversion.

**Scapegoat Mechanism in the Bible: Old and New Testaments**

**Old Testament:**
- Servant of God songs reveal persecutors' guilt and scapegoat mechanism
- God's role is ambiguous, not fully devoid of violence (Girard)
- Isaiah 53:10 interpretation varies among scholars
- New impulse of revelation present in Old Testament

**New Testament:**
- Consummaton of biblical revelation
- Passion of Jesus Christ as collective murder of an innocent victim
- Acts of the Apostles: Herod, Pontius Pilate, and the crowds against Jesus
- Friends of Jesus join in persecution (Mark 14:10–11, 50, 66–72)
- Innocent scapegoat identified as "Lamb of God" (John 1:29; 1 John 3:5; Acts 8:32)
- Conversion of Peter and Paul crucial for understanding scapegoat mechanism

**Scapegoat Mechanism in New Testament Texts:**
- Gospels portray Jesus as completely innocent victim
- John 15:25: Persecution of Jesus without cause (cf. Psalms 35:19; 69:5)
- Peter's denial and conversion (Mark 14:50, 66–72; Acts 9:1–22; 1 Corinthians 15:9; Galatians 1:13–16)
- Mob mentality in John 8:1–11: Jesus challenges mob to cast first stone if free of sin.

**Conclusion:**
- Scapegoat mechanism revealed through biblical texts, both Old and New Testament
- Collective persecution of innocent victims
- Importance of conversion for understanding scapegoat dynamics.


#### Exploring Jesus and the overcoming of sacrificial violence in the New Testament

**Girard's Interpretation of Jesus and the New Testament**

**The Crowd's Transformation:**
- Members leave the site of the would-be stoning
- Conscious of their own guilt
- No further bothering or attacking woman
- Jesus puts a stop to spreading mimetic contagion with his nonviolent example (Girard: "nonviolent contagion")

**Parallels between Old and New Testaments:**
- Jesus depicted as "lamb of God" and falsely "numbered with the transgressors" (Isaiah 53)
- Overcoming mythical elements in the Old Testament, such as:
  - Reinterpretation of the Fall of Man account
  - Exposure of archaic religion's legislative ambivalence
  - Replacement by faith in Jesus
- Depiction of God's expulsion of man from paradise overcome in the New Testament

**Repudiation of Sacrificial Theologies:**
- Jesus's death on the cross not a sacrifice, according to Girard
- Jesus accepts "mercy over sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6; Matthew 9:13; 12:7)
- New Testament God is not violent and does not require violence (Matthew 5:43–45)

**Jesus as the Innocent Victim:**
- Absolutely nonviolent person, making him a scapegoat in a violent culture
- Uncovering of scapegoat mechanism through his radical nonviolence and insight into the logic of violence
- Transcendence of love (opposed to false transcendence from sacrificial mechanisms)

**Divinity of Jesus:**
- Differentiated from sacred gods originating from human sacrifice
- Divine being that does not owe existence to human violence
- New Testament clearly differentiates Jesus's divinity from archaic myth (Gospel of Mark: Herod believes in resurrected prophets)


#### Jesus's nonviolent divine origin and imitation in overcoming mimetic rivalry

**The Virgin Conception and Jesus's Nonviolence**

**Disciples of Jesus Reject Violent Apotheoses**:
- Disciples reject apotheoses of violence and contrast them with the divinity of the Son of God
- When asked who they think Jesus is, disciples mention John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah or other prophets as possibilities
- Peter identifies Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of the living God
- Jesus responds that this knowledge comes from his Father in heaven, not flesh and blood

**The Virgin Conception as an Expression of Jesus's Nonviolence**:
- The virgin conception implies that Jesus is not dependent on the world of violence
- Comparison to mythical virgin births shows absence of sexual moments and devaluation of human sexuality
- Absence of violence and deceit in the biblical account contrasts with mythical narratives of gods mating with human women, which are marked by these elements

**Positive Mimesis**:
- The only real and nonviolent means to overcoming mimetic rivalry is found in the New Testament
- The scape-goat mechanism offers a possible way of resolving the mimetic crisis, but is based on collective violence
- The New Testament shows another way, which is not a renunciation of imitation but a positive form of mimesis (nonviolent imitation)
- Jesus is the only role model who does not instigate violent struggle among those who imitate him
- Imitating Jesus's imitation of God leads to an attitude of renunciation that enables overcoming mimetic rivalry

**Creative Renunciation**:
- The great novelists gained insight into the workings of desire through their "creative renunciation" of the deceptive divinity of pride
- Girard emphasizes the importance of renouncing revenge, violence, and other forms of rivalrous desire as the intrinsic principle of the Kingdom of God
- The principal commandment of the Kingdom is to turn the other cheek and surrender everything to the rival to defuse mimetic rivalry


#### Comparing Girard's Mimetic Theory and Augustine's Imitation of God in Christianity.

**Renunciation and Mimetic Desire in Girard's Thought**

**Girard's Emphasis on Renunciation:**
- Suggests proximity to Biblical Revelation and Christianity
- Sees solution to mimetic rivalry as creative renunciation of self-empowerment, not death or extinction of desire
- Distances himself from interpretations of renunciation as oriental escapism
- Renunciation implies readiness for the cross in situations of conflict, based on imitation of Christ

**Augustine's Influence on Girard:**
- Both differentiate between humble imitation of God and perverse imitation of Satan
- Augustine emphasizes need for external impetus (grace) for positive mimesis
- Role models play significant role in conversion process

**Girard's Mimetic Theory and Criticisms:**
- Sometimes interpreted as an ontology of violence due to emphasis on prevalence of evil in human relations
- Misunderstandings can be rejected by considering the context of Christian teachings on Original Sin and grace.


#### Girard's interpretation of Original Sin and its relation to human culture and violence.

**Girard's View on Original Sin**
- Girard references **Original Sin** in his later writings to clarify his theory
- References to Original Sin are not mere passing remarks but present in early studies
- Differentiates between "promethean" or "satanic" imitation and genuine Christian imitation, connecting it to Augustine's identification of pride as Original Sin
- Compares Jesus and Adam, emphasizing their initial innocence before being confronted with temptation
- Rejects interpretations that portray Adam as a mere scapegoat or blame the Fall on Eve
- Argues against combining Original Sin with predestination, which creates divisions between "righteous" and "condemned"

**Mimetic Theory and Original Sin**
- Mimetic theory positions within teachings of Original Sin
- Implies all human beings are susceptible to mimetic rivalry and scapegoating
- Rejects God of differences, rooted in the scapegoat mechanism, as contrary to biblical God who causes sun and rain on both good and evil
- Human civilization is a product of Cainian culture, not God's creation
- The collective murder of the scapegoat mechanism forms the threshold of hominization or transition from animal species to mankind.

**Scapegoat Mechanism as Hominization Threshold**
- Girard postulates that the scapegoat mechanism is responsible for the formation of human culture and organization through prohibition and ritual.


#### Analysis of Girard's "Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World": Scholarship on hominization, mimesis, and Original Sin.

**Girard's Theory of Hominization and Original Sin**

**Ambiguities in Girard's Thesis**:
- Paul Dumouchel identified central ambiguities in Girard's thesis regarding hominization
- Dumouchel saw conflicting messages: 
    - Invocation of human freedom to turn away from violence and convert to Christianity
    - Violence portrayed as a necessary product of mimesis, a biological attribute of humans

**Resolution by Raymund Schwager**:
- Schwager demonstrated how Girard's anthropological thesis can be understood in the context of Christian teachings on Original Sin
- Distinguishes three stages of hominization:
    1. Continuity between man and animal with regard to mimesis
    2. Break from animal societies due to emergence of "metaphysical desire" or self-divinization, leading to scapegoating mechanism
    3. Continuity between animal and human behaviors, rooted in human failure before God

**Girard's Embrace of Teachings on Original Sin**:
- Girard has embraced the teachings of Original Sin in his later writings
- Schwager used mimetic theory and evolutionary understanding to examine Original Sin
- James Alison also used mimetic theory to examine Original Sin from a Christian perspective

**Grace, Resurrection, and Holy Spirit**:
- **James Alison**: Argues that only after experiencing reconciliation and salvation can humans realize their entanglement in sin and liberate themselves.
- **Girard**: Sees Jesus as coming from outside the human world to free humanity from violence, contrasting with the "Peace that the world gives" based on structural violence.
- Grace is essential for overcoming the scapegoat mechanism, according to Girard.


#### Exploring the origin and significance of sacrifice in ancient religion vs. Christianity. Girard's insights on grace, the Holy Spirit, and sacriﬁce.

**Girard's Theory on Jesus and the Scapegoat Mechanism**

**The Persecution of Jesus**:
- The Jews and pagans come together to persecute Jesus
- Even the disciples are unable to resist the "mimetic attraction" of the mob
- They either desert or deny their master

**The Emergence of a New Myth**:
- All necessary conditions for the emergence of a new myth are met
- The fate of Jesus is portrayed not by myth, but by the Gospels
- The Gospels break through the pattern of mythical violence and are the product of a "protesting minority"

**Grace and the Reversal of the Disciples' Point of View**:
- The "mimetic theory" transcends the realm of reason and incorporates the mystery of grace that led to the reversal of the disciples' point of view
- The resurrection of Jesus enabled them to escape the mimetic pull of the persecutors and adopt the perspective of the innocent victim

**Examples of Reversal**:
- **Peter**: Realized his involvement in the persecution of Jesus when he exchanged a glance with him at the crucifixion
- **Paul**: Heard Jesus' words, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"

**The Holy Spirit as the Defender of Victims**:
- The original meaning of the word "Paraclete" (Holy Spirit) is "lawyer for the defense, defender of the accused"
- The Holy Spirit discloses to individuals the literal truth about their acts of persecution

**Sacrilege in Archaic Religions vs. Christian Sacrifice**:
- Ritual sacrificial is an inextricable element of archaic religions, in direct opposition to biblical revelation
- The Christian tradition refers to the crucifixion of Jesus as a "sacrifice," but this differs from archaic sacrifice
- The modern rejection of sacrilege is a positive fruit of biblical thinking


#### Modern Rejection of Sacrifice in Liberal Thought and Literature: From Hobbes to Dostoyevsky

**Modern Rejection of Sacrifice**

**According to Hobbes's Understanding:**
- Natural law: man is forbidden to destroy own life or means of preservation
- Self-preservation is highest principle
- Endorses war, grants citizens right to elude dangers brought by state
- Rejects Jesus's call for unilateral concession in Sermon on the Mount

**Rawls and Sacrifice:**
- Justice denies that loss of freedom can be outweighed by greater good
- Each person possesses inviolability founded on justice
- Modern rational morality abolishes sacrifice as an element of morality

**Habermas' Analysis:**
- Normative core of enlightenment culture is the abolition of publicly demanded sacriﬁce
- Analyzes death penalty, conscription, tax liability, compulsory education

**Dostoyevsky's Brothers Karamazov:**
- Modern rejection of archaic sacrificial logic through Ivan and Alyosha
- Ivan's revolt against God: no longer connected to spirit of biblical revelation
- Rejects Jesus as role model, attempts to create just world with own powers
- Failure results in massacre (indirectly through Smerdyakov)

**Early Liberal Tradition:**
- Tendency for massacre despite rejection of human sacrifice
- Rawls' theory excludes sacriﬁcial situations from outset, but remains unsuccessful
- Habermas moral admiration for those who make "unreasonable" sacriﬁces in neighbor's interest.


#### Modern Dangers of Sacrifice: From Archaic to Massacre and Self-Giving.

**The Danger of Modern World's Rejection of Sacrifice**

**Ivan Karamazov's Failed Plan**:
- Ivan's pursuit of autonomy leads to a bloody, ultimately suicidal massacre that transcends the violence of archaic sacrifice.
- This is similar to the massacres during the conquering of Latin America, which were legitimized as the fight against human sacrifice.

**The Concept of "Massacre"**:
- Massacre is an atheistic murder, unlike the religious sacrifice in archaic cultures.
- The conquistadors' massacre of those making the original sacrifices was a new form of sacrilege, a "sacrificial anti-sacrifice".

**Girard's Analysis**:
- **Roberto Calasso's Cultural Critique (The Ruin of Kasch)**: Identifies the modern world's increasing violence as an exponential increase of archaic sacrifice.
- **Girard's Argument**: The perversion of biblical revelation leads to a modern form of persecution, where people seek to be viewed as "the victim".
- Girard sees the New Testament figure of the Antichrist as the embodiment of the complexities facing the modern world.

**Two Forms of Totalitarianism**:
1. **The Extreme Right**: Rooted in an illusory attempt to return to archaic sacrificial culture, exemplified by the Holocaust.
2. **The "Other Totalitarianism"**: Rooted in a radicalization of the biblical concern for victims, seeking to usurp the place of Christ and abolish prohibitions.
- This form of totalitarianism appears legitimate at first, but threatens a sacrilege of nature through mass consumerism.


#### Renouncing violent sacrifice: Alyosha Karamazov, good harlot, and Jesus' self-giving.

**Renunciation of Desire and Violence**
- Concept implies renouncing objects that result in mimetic rivalry and violence
- Alyosha Karamazov's refusal of sacrificial logic without becoming a prophet of massacre
- Self-giving as the foundation for humane life in the face of conflict

**Biblical Instances of Self-Giving**
- Servant of Yahweh's songs of lament: nonviolent conduct forces persecutors to recognize innocence
- Jesus' decision in favor of nonviolence, giving his life to save others

**Judgment of Solomon and the Good Harlot**
- Renunciation of self to save child's life, risking own life and motherhood
- Embodies spirit of self-giving, not masochistic or archaic sacrifice logic

**Christian Self-Giving vs. Masochism**
- Differences between Christian and masochistic forms of self-sacrifice
- Protecting Christianity from accusations of masochism in psychoanalytic circles

**Literary Examples of Mimetic Rivalry and Masochistic Sacrilege**
- Father Zossima's reference to "active love" vs. "passionate love" (Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov)


#### Discussing Girard's critique of sacrificial terminology in Christianity and its implications for interfaith dialogue

**Girard's Opposition to Modern Theories Equating Myth and Christianity**
- Girard strictly opposed using the same terminology to describe myth and Christianity
- Argued that the Christian tradition, with its reference to the "sacrifice" of Jesus, had failed to comprehend the message of the Gospels
- Claimed misperceptions in the New Testament itself, such as the Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 9:22–26; 10:11–14)

**Girard's Revision on Sacrifice in Christianity**
- Later revised his position under the influence of Swiss theologian Raymund Schwager
- Conceded that his earlier rejection of the term "sacrifice" was influenced by a seductive liberal tendency
- Harkened back to the judgment of Solomon to outline the different forms of sacrifice and reject the liberal "illusion"
- Understood the crucifixion of Christ as a "divine re-employment of the scapegoat mechanism"
- Retracted his criticism of the Epistle to the Hebrews, recognizing it broke from archaic logic in its depiction of the Crucifixion as the final overcoming of pagan ritual

**Biblical Revelation and Christianity**
- Girard returned to the conversion of great novelistic authors, describing their spiritual conversion as a form of sacrilege
- Novelists looked to the Bible, particularly the verse of the "grain of wheat" (John 12:24), to convey their spiritual conversion
- Novelists first had to renounce self-righteousness before experiencing the resurrection that led to the creation of their great novels

**Girard's Paradoxical Unity of All That Is Religious**
- Girard's terminological revision did not go unnoticed, with some scholars claiming it contradicted his fundamental critique of archaic sacrificial cultures
- Georg Baudler accused Girard of identifying too closely with Schwager's position and representing an "ultimately unbiblical anthropological pessimism"
- Baudler's claim was untenable, as it ignored Girard's understanding of Original Sin
- Baudler also argued that Girard's emphasis on the singularity of the Bible counteracts contemporary interreligious dialogue
- This problem is made possible by viewpoints that see sacrificial sacrifice belonging only to archaic religions and not Christianity


#### Exploring the Unity of Religions: Girard's Interpretation of Sacrificial Christianity and Its Historical Implications.

**Understanding Girard's Perspective on Religion: Unity Among All Forms**

**Baudler vs. Girard:**
- Baudler sees religion in black-and-white terms, missing the unity among all religions (Girard)
- Both recognize critical role of axial religions in overcoming primitive sacrifice
- Differences between myth and Bible do not imply separation of forms of religion for Girard

**Girard's Emphasis on Unity:**
- All religions seek peace, even those with violent rituals (Augustine's perspective)
- No creature can deny the natural law of peace (Augustine's ontology)
- Even mythical monsters like Cacus have universal peaceful intentions

**Sacriﬁcial Christianity and Apocalyptical Reading of History:**
- New Testament uncovers scapegoat mechanism in Gospel Passion and salvation of Jesus
- Sacriﬁcial interpretation: Jesus' death as a sacrifice to appease God
- Resulted in persecution of minority groups, despite biblical revelation's opposition to mythical violence

**Sacriﬁcial Christianity:**
- Characterized by sacriﬁcial interpretation of Gospel Passion and salvation of Jesus
- Leads to a culture based on misunderstanding of the text
- Followers project interpersonal violence onto God, relieving themselves of responsibility.


#### Biblical Revelation and the Crisis of Mimetic Violence in Western Society.

**Sacrificial Christianity and the Modern World as Mimetic Crisis**

**Scapegoating and Violence**:
- Sacrificial Christianity can lead to a spiral of violence, ending in arbitrary persecution of scapegoats
- The persecution of other groups is a characteristic of sacrificial Christianity, including the persecution of Jews, heretics, witches, crusades, and religious wars
- This massive unloading of collective violence can also be observed in the conventional interpretation of the biblical apocalypse, where God is seen as the primeval father of apocalyptic destruction

**The Old Testament and the New Testament**:
- Sacrificial Christianity can be seen as a regression to Old Testament conceptions of sacrifice
- The Old Testament establishes the foundation for the overcoming of mythical thinking, but does not fully uncover the scapegoat mechanism
- Sacrificial Christianity reverses the interpretive order of the Old and New Testaments, reading the Gospels in the light of the Old Testament

**Modern World as Mimetic Crisis**:
- Judeo-Christian revelation was most responsible for bringing about the difference between archaic and modern societies
- The biblical uncovering of the scapegoat mechanism made all archaic strategies of channeling violence obsolete, leading to the development of the modern world as a planetary mimetic crisis
- Social differences arose to prevent future outbreaks of mimetic crisis, such as ancient slavery and feudalism, but were impervious to the biblical impulse of equality
- With the dawn of modernity, these hierarchical differences collapsed, and the crisis of violence present at the foundation of civilization reemerged

**Globalization**:
- The contemporary phenomenon of globalization is connected to the modern nondifferentiated world brought about by biblical revelation
- Sacrificial Christianity harbors a universalist potential, the "germs of a planetary society"
- Globalization increasingly displays the critical impulse of the Bible, bringing together cultural differences and leading to a universal hegemony of mimesis

**Apocalyptical Reading of History**:
- Girard does not see globalization and modern nondifferentiated as positive developments without dangers
- The biblical unmasking of the scapegoat mechanism and violent cultural forms does not lead automatically to paradise on earth, but rather to initial dangers even greater than those previously existed.


#### Apocalyptic dimension of Girard's mimetic theory: biblical warnings against violence and sacrificial culture.

**Apocalyptical Dimension of Mimetic Theory**

**Girard's View on Apocalypse:**
- Believes biblical revelation provides clearer understanding of modern world
- Sees danger in disregarding Bible's warning against vengeful thinking and lack of sacred protective mechanisms
- Humans capable of destroying themselves due to advanced technology
- Environmental catastrophes also indicate apocalyptic situation

**Impact on Humanity:**
- Choice between God's message (nonviolence) and self-extirpation

**Apocalyptical Dangers:**
- Destructive force in the world, subverting mythical cultures
- Perceived as subversive by all cultures rooted in myth
- Jesus seen as destructive and subversive force

**Christianity as Katechon (Counterbalance):**
- Overlooked biblical propensity to undermine legitimacy of culture
- Recognized by political thinkers like Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, Nietzsche, Weber, Schmitt, Vogelin, and Arendt
- Dostoyevsky's "Grand Inquisitor" tale illustrates dangers Jesus poses to culture.


#### Exploring the Role of Satan in Mimetic Theory and Biblical Revelation

**Mimetic Theory and Satan: The Mimetic Cycle**

**Concept of Satan as Embodiment of Mimetic Rivalry and Scapegoat Logic:**
- In "I See Satan Fall Like Lightning," Girard discusses Satan as the embodiment of mimetic rivalry and scapegoat logic.
- The concept consists of three essential aspects: mimetic crisis, collective violence (scapegoat mechanism), and divine epiphany (mythical divinization).

**Mimetic Crisis:**
- Spread of mimetic rivalry throughout the community leads to chaos and conflict.

**Collective Violence (Scapegoat Mechanism):**
- Transforms chaos into a newly established order through collective persecution of an external entity or group, known as the scapegoat.

**Divine Epiphany:**
- Veils real violence behind mob's persecution and is seen as divine intervention or mythical divinization.

**Understanding Satan:**
- In the Bible, Satan is both a principle of order (ruler of this world) and chaos (diábolos – "he who throws across").

**Three Moments of Mimetic Cycle:**
1. Mimetic crisis: Generated by the spread of mimetic rivalry throughout the community.
2. Collective violence (scapegoat mechanism): Transforms chaos into order through persecution.
3. Divine epiphany: Veils real violence and is seen as divine intervention or mythical divinization.


#### Mimetic Theory: Satan as Mimetically Induced Chaos and Scapegoat Mechanism.

**The Devil as a Generator of Chaos: Mimetic Rivalry and Scandal**

**Mimetic Rivalry and Satan**:
- The devil embodies the mimetic dynamic of model-obstacle, transforming human beings into reciprocal enemies
- Jesus's rejection of Peter as a "stumbling block" (scandal) illustrates this chaotic side of Satan
- Scandal refers to the paradoxical obstacle that is both repelling and attracting, leading to mimetic rivalry

**Mimetic Rivalry and the New Testament**:
- Hate towards a brother is a necessary consequence of scandal (1 John 2:10-11)
- Jesus's words to Peter reveal the scandal-inducing nature of mimetic rivalry
- Mimetic rivalry and satanic desire are one and the same in the New Testament

**Satan's Divided Kingdom: The Paradoxical Order of the Scapegoat Mechanism**:
- Satan is identified with both chaos and order, representing the paradoxical nature of the scapegoat mechanism
- The devil stands as the accuser (Satan) in opposition to the Holy Spirit, the "defender of victims"
- Satan's regulatory power is manifested through the victimage mechanism that overcomes mimetic crisis


#### Exploring Satan's role in religion through mimetic theory: scapegoats, powers, and transcendence.

**Divine Epiphany and Satanic Transcendence**

**Third Stage of Mimetic Cycle:**
- Divine epiphany from collective's divinization of persecuted victims
- Scapegoat mechanism gives rise to mythical religions
- Disguises truth of Biblical Revelation and Christianity's founding murder
- Corresponds to Satan as "father of lies" in New Testament (John 8:44)
- Social peace engendered by violence is shrouded in religion
- Powers and principalities represent order established by scapegoat mechanism

**Satan's Fall: Triumph of the Cross Reveals His Essence:**
- Biblical revelation unearths truth of scapegoat mechanism, bringing about Satan's dominion's end
- Triumph of cross analogous to Satan's inevitable end
- New Testament describes this triumph through various passages (Colossians 2:13–15, 1 Corinthians 2:7–8)

**Avoiding Misperceptions about Satan:**
- Avoid transforming devil into real entity or scapegoat for man's actions
- Satan embodies mimetic dynamics and mimesis in the mimetic cycle
- Essence is absence of being, attempting to nest itself in human relations.


#### Exploring Girard's connection between scapegoat mechanism, Plato, and Derrida's deconstruction in understanding Western thought.

**The Relationship Between Mimetic Theory and Deconstruction**

**Girard's Understanding of the Bible:**
- Identifies human collective as origin of devil (Simon's statement: "Maybe it's only us")
- Connection to deconstruction due to paradoxical structure in cultural forms rooted in scapegoat mechanism

**Deconstruction and the Mimetic Theory:**
- Girard discovered connection between mimetic theory and deconstruction through Derrida's work on supplement
- Both explore untenable paradoxes in philosophical texts and biblical revelation
- Convergence but also significant divergence: Girard argues for truth outside all texts; Derrida focuses on interpreting texts without attainable factual truths.

**The Logic of the Supplement:**
- Central concept in Western metaphysics, discovered by Derrida through analysis of major philosophers
- Writing initially viewed as subordinate and derivative compared to spoken word
- Deconstruction reveals that spoken word is necessarily derived from written argument
- Supplement carries a threatening double entendre: remedy and poison at once.

**Girard's Analysis of Plato's Phaedrus Dialogue:**
- Written word described as pharmakon (remedy and poison) in the dialogue
- Similar to scapegoats that protect and expel evil from community
- Ambivalent logic applies to both written word and scapegoats: beneficial yet harmful.

**Connection Between Deconstruction and Scapegoat Mechanism:**
- Derrida's deconstruction of Plato's Pharmacy sheds light on complex nature of supplement
- Sacrifices of ancient Greece serve as structural parallels to logic of the supplement
- Both writing and scapegoats can be seen as dangerous supplements for cultural order.


#### Comparing Girard's Mimetic Theory with Deconstruction and Heidegger's Philosophy: Truth in Texts and Dissolution of Structures.

**Girard's Thought: Origins of Revelation and Deconstruction**

**Girard's Perspective on Myths and Philosophy:**
- Myths influenced by Derrida's logic of the supplement
- Paradoxical logic of scapegoat mechanism in social crisis
- Identical to paradoxical logic of Satan
- Similarities between mimetic theory and deconstruction

**Girard's Concept of Différance:**
- French term for differencing and suspending culture
- Connection to Derrida's concept of différance
- Relationship between law and violence

**McKenna's Study: Violent Différance:**
- Essential anthropological backing for deconstruction
- Girard's interpretation of Bible enables "nihilistic rediscovery of Christianity"

**Gianni Vattimo's Connection:**
- Attempts convergence with mimetic theory
- Sees incarnation as dissolution of violent God
- Weakening of strong structures in history of Being

**Girard vs. Heidegger:**
- Girard: Heidegger recognizes inherent paradoxes of sacred, but fails to recognize nonviolence as essential difference at work in New Testament
- Vattimo: Heidegger's philosophy a full-on transcription of Judeo-Christian revelation

**Understanding of Truth and Textual Referentiality:**
- Girard distances himself from deconstruction due to radical denial of texts referring to external reality and possibility of truth.
- Rejects Derrida's argument that there are no factual origins on which concepts can be based.


#### Exploring Girard's critique of deconstruction: Origin of sign and truth in scapegoat mechanism.

**Girard's Critique of Deconstruction and Poststructuralism:**
* Girard emphasizes that a return to Pre-Socraticism is insufficient for understanding Western metaphysics
* He argues that the scapegoat mechanism in archaic religion must be deconstructed to reveal its origins
* The discovery of the founding violence justifies and marks the threshold of deconstruction, leading to a "reconstruction"
* Poststructuralist theory's rejection of referentiality and truth threatens to degenerate into nihilism
* Girard praises Derrida's analysis in "Plato's Pharmacy" for referencing actual scapegoat rituals in ancient Greece
* Girard's critique of postmodern nihilism is more directed at Derrida's teaching than the founder of deconstruction himself
* Derrida's distinction between Nietzsche's critique and deciphering facts or origin differs from Girard's view
* Girard proposes a genetic model recognizing the scapegoat mechanism as the origin of language and signs
* Girard defends referentiality and factual interpretation against postmodern tendencies
* His concern for victims demands acknowledgment of facts, not just interpretations
* Girard's historical approach emphasizes the relationship between texts and their real origins.


#### Mimetic Theory: Biblical Revelation and Figural Interpretation. Girard's analysis of scapegoat mechanism and divine truth.

**Mimetic Theory: Figura Christi and Biblical Revelation**

**Girard's Perspective**:
- Mimetic theory as deconstruction of myth and cultural order based on biblical revelation
- Bible sheds light on victimage mechanism, demythologizing cultures
- Critique of postmodern nihilism for not acknowledging biblical truth
- Emphasis on nonviolent love and solidarity with victims (Joseph, Job, Jesus Christ)

**Figura Christi**:
- FIGURA CHRISTI: Disparate figures in Old and New Testament that reveal scapegoat mechanism
- Old Testament passergs quoted in Gospels reveal this connection
- Preservation of historicity, focusing on real events within time
- Both events point to something still to come, ultimate certainty in God as consummate truth

**Mimetic Theory and Figural Interpretation**:
- Similar emphasis on referentiality and historical context
- Vertical connection to God in interpretation of divine truth
- Transcends question of referentiality (Joseph vs. Oedipus myth)


### 6. Political Implications of the Mimetic Theory

**Mimetic Theory and Political Implications: Sacred Kingship as Origin of Political Power**

**Background:**
- Mimetic theory explains origins of archaic religions, human civilization, and political institutions through scapegoat mechanism
- Sacred kingship is an ancient political institution connected to the scapegoat mechanism in surprising ways

**Connection Between Scapegoat Mechanism and Sacred Kingship:**
- Both represent opposite ends of social hierarchy: king vs. scapegoat
- Transformation of victim into god and eventual exalted master after murder
- Community's violence towards the victim remains hidden, disguised by sacred rituals
- Double transference: victim is initially seen as evil and later benevolent
- Ritual repetition emphasizes one moment over another to establish order and harmony

**Origins of Sacred Kingship:**
- Victim chosen for ritual sacrifice holds prestigious status before death
  - Tupinambá people: victims granted highest social privileges despite being captive enemies
  - Aztecs: victims given god or king-like status, community's veneration transformed into political power

**King as Victim:**
- Kings reign through future death and transformation of community's veneration into political influence
- Power can develop so strongly that the sacrifice is no longer necessary
- King's ability to resolve conflict within the community keeps his sacrilege postponed or surrogate victim used instead.


#### The origin of kingship and scapegoat mechanism: Sacrifice and sovereignty in ancient rituals.

**The Sacrifice Element in Kingship: A Connection to the Scapegoat Mechanism**

**Characteristics of Sacred Kingdoms:**
- **Sacrificial Victim**: Prince forced to commit incest or other extreme taboos to become king (e.g., African sovereign incest rites)
- **Violent Enthronement Rituals**: Collective animosity and violent acts against the elected monarch (e.g., Timmes in Sierra Leone, Nigerian enthronement rituals)
- **Scapegoat Mechanism**: New rulers encircled by bloodthirsty subjects or buffeted during coronation; surrogate victims sacrificed in place of the king (e.g., Shilluk people, Tibetan Buddhists)

**Thomas Hobbes and the Concept of Sovereignty:**
- **Sacrificial Role of the Sovereign**: Excluded from the community, vests all power and decrees laws to which they are not subject (similarities with scapegoat)
- **Obedience and Protection**: Civil obedience conditioned upon sovereign's ability to provide protection for subjects (reciprocal relationship)
- **Mortality of Sovereignty**: Despite intentions of endless power, sovereigns were often killed if unable to overcome crises (similarities with scapegoat)
- **Right to Resistance**: Older forms of right to resistance shared similar conditions of protection and obedience (proximity between sovereign and scapegoat).


#### Exploring the connection between political power and scapegoating: Sacred kingship, decisionism, and capital punishment.

**Sovereignty and Decisionism: Schmitt's Political Theology**

**Definition of Sovereign**: He who decides on the exception

**Decisionism**: A doctrine focusing on situations of social exception, as pursued by Carl Schmitt under Hobbes' influence

**Connection between Sovereignty and Founding Murder**:
- Social disorder and chaos precede law and norm in human civilization
- Decision (scapegoat mechanism) builds foundation of human culture
- Latin "decidere": to cut off or cut victim's throat, revealing deeper connection between decision and scapegoat mechanism

**Schmitt's Emphasis on Exception**: "The rule proves nothing; the exception proves everything"
- Alludes to essence of scapegoat mechanism, which is a "model of the exception" and most rudimentary cultural symbol
- Community chooses victim randomly to overcome general mayhem

**Executive Power and Decisionism**:
- Federalist Papers' emphasis on unity of command in executive power
- Remains of archaic scapegoating mentality: Attributing mistakes to a single responsible individual

**Wilhelm II as Scapegoat Emperor**:
- Displayed archaic forms of sacred kingship into the 20th century
- Publicly accused of social transgressions, including homosexuality
- Germans blamed him for Germany's defeat in WWI, shifting blame to a single individual

**Scapegoating in Modern Politics**:
- Aging politicians can become "scapegoats" for issues hindering successors
- Illusion that expelling the scapgoat will solve all problems

**Capital Punishment as Origin of Legal Order**:
- Dostoyevsky's understanding that written codes are inextricable from concept of justice
- Capital punishment forms ancient core of legal order, despite contradiction to modern beliefs.


#### The historical significance of the death penalty and its connection to violence, law, and human sacrifice.

**The Importance of Capital Punishment for Conservative Thinkers**

**Joseph de Maistre's Perspective**:
- The **executioner** possessed central political influence
- Removal of the executioner would lead to chaos, as it represents the "terror and bond" of human association

**Juan Donoso Cortés's Arguments Against Abolition**:
- Capital punishment is indispensable for stemming internal community violence
- Without capital punishment, society would become a "hell" where "blood will then gush forth from the rocks"
- Abolition of capital punishment would result in the long-term disappearance of all forms of punishment

**Political Implications**:
- The connection between political power and capital punishment is evident
- Countries that adhere to the death penalty, such as the United States, may be more willing to use military violence abroad

**Walter Benjamin's Critique of Violence**:
- Capital punishment, rather than punishing infringement of law, establishes new law
- Capital punishment is a form of "law-engendering" violence that directs criticism at the foundations of justice

**The Death Penalty as Scapegoating Mechanism**:
- The criminal becomes the **scapegoat** for the community's guilt, even if they are innocent
- The **death penalty** is a "violent foundation" of legal order that traces back to archaic sacrilege


#### Capital Punishment, Scapegoat Mechanism, and Friend/Enemy Relations in Ancient and Modern Political Thought

**Girard's Analysis of Capital Punishment:**
* Gernet describes connection between capital punishment and scapegoat mechanism as direct extension of generative violence (298)
* Two types: religious execution and apagoge (immediate lynching)
* Both interconnected, offer insight into root of statutory punishment in founding violence

**Scapegoat Mechanism:**
* Negative transference: executed victims seen as guilty criminals
* Positive transference: veneration of criminals awaiting execution
* Remains, objects with which they came into contact were venerated as sacred relics (criminal lore)

**Christianity's Relationship to Capital Punishment:**
* Early Christians opposed capital punishment in first centuries AD
* Opposition later suppressed and death penalty became a fixed element of Christian culture
* Catholic Church's stance changed in last decades, now publicly opposes death penalty

**Friend/Enemy Distinction in Politics:**
* Enmity intrinsic to political relations throughout history
* Example from Greek polis: Aeschylus' Th e Eumenides
* Aristotle and Plato emphasized friend/enemy distinction as well
* Eastern philosophies, such as Taoism, also emphasized enmity (Laozi)
* Cold War era marked by strong political hostility between nation-states.

**The Friend/Enemy Distinction:**
* Carl Schmitt's definition: "friend and enemy are the original categories of political decision"
* Tabooed due to Schmitt's Nazi past, but understood as unchallengeable in early 20th century political thought (Georg Simmel, Sigmund Freud)
* Friend/enemy distinction characterizes nation-state era politics.


#### Exploring the origins of political enmity through the scapegoat mechanism and religious rituals.

**Simmel's Sociological Rule and Friend/Enemy Relations:**
* **Sociological Rule**: All social unity is preconditioned by hostility towards an external enemy (Simmel)
* **Freud's Observation**: Close connection between internal love and external enmity (Freud)
* **End of Cold War**: Hope for overcoming political enmity but failed to bring about peace
* **Clash of Civilizations**: Huntington attempted to subsume friend/enemy distinctions under this concept
* **Origin of Political Enmity:** Friend/enemy relations may not be necessary components of man's political nature; they could be deconstructed as cultural products and extensions of the scapegoat mechanism (Girard)

**Mimetic Theory and Friend/Enemy Relations:**
* **Primitive Warfare**: No real difference between external enemy and internal friend (Girard)
* **Scapegoat Mechanism**: Violence channeled from within group to an external enemy, leading to friend/enemy relations
* **Ritual Violence**: Difference between internal and external violence; political enmity and warfare are more advanced forms of containing violence

**The Eumenides (Aeschylus):**
* **Collective Violence**: Transition from scapegoat mechanism to political enmity
* **Erinyes**: Represent collective violence in Aeschylus's tragedy Th e Eumenides
* **Athena's Intervention**: Pacifies the Erinyes by persuading them to function as blissful goddesses (Eumenides) in future service to Athens
* **Shift of Violence**: Transformation of internal violence to external enemy target


### 7. Mimetic Theory and Gender

**Mimetic Theory and Gender**

**Girard's Analytical Approach**:
- Similarities to feminist stances on victim status of women
- "Heremeneutics of suspicion" method of textual interpretation

**Girard's Critique of Feminism**:
- Some accusations of sexism and patriarchalism
- Mimetic theory stands for all victims, not just women
- Potential for a more encompassing feminist theory built on mimetic theory

**Mimetic Desire and Gender**:
- Critique that Girard's concept only applies to masculine desire
- Examples from literature: Two Gentlemen of Verona, A Midsummer Night's Dream
- Freud's theory of narcissism and gender specificity in desire

**Freud's Theory of Narcissism**:
- Attachment type (male) vs. narcissistic type (female)
- Female "self-contentment" and lack of need for object love
- Attraction to others' narcissism

**Conclusion**:
- Girard's theory is not gender specific, applies to both men and women
- Various examples from literature demonstrate this equality


#### Exploring Pseudonarcissism in Freud's theory of desire versus Girard's perspective on mimetic desire in literature.

**Girard's Critique of Freud's Perspective on Desire**

**Key Points:**
- Girard argues that Freud's stance is misogynistic due to the assumption that a "narcissistic" desire exists, differentiating from normal object-oriented desire.
- Girard sees both Freudian modes of desire as manifestations of mimesis rather than two distinct types.
- The concept of pseudonarcissism:
  - Narcissists appear self-assured and indifferent, but this is a strategy to attract others.
  - Outward indifference makes the narcissist an attractive target for imitation and admiration from others.
  - This cycle of imitating each other's narcissistic behavior can lead to authentic self-love for the narcissist.

**Freud's Misunderstanding of Pseudonarcissism:**
- According to Girard, Freud was influenced by the beauty and indifference of women around him, leading him to an admiration of women and resentment.
- Novelistic authors like Cervantes, Proust, Dostoyevsky, and Shakespeare provide a better understanding of pseudonarcissism than Freud.

**Shakespeare's Twelfth Night:**
- The comedy tells the story of Orsino's unsuccessful attempts to court Olivia, who is described as narcissistic for her indifference.
- Viola (disguised as Cesario) delivers Orsino's marriage proposal to Olivia with no sexual interest. This radical indifference causes Olivia to fall in love with Viola/Cesario.
- Once a genuine desire resists the attraction of the narcissist, all self-assurance collapses.

**Orsino's Insight:**
- Orsino expresses insight into the mimetic nature of desire when reflecting on the extinguishment of desires once they are fulfilled: "O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou... Nought enters there, Of what validity and pitch soe'er, But falls into abatement and low price."
- The deeper truth is that there is no real difference between Orsino and Olivia in terms of the nature of desire.


#### Exploring gender roles in desire, scapegoating, and ancient myths. Women as victims and goddesses.

**Pseudonarcissism and Gender Equality in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night**
- **The Duke**: An archetype of pseudonarcissism due to his insight into the loss of value of fulfilled desires, leading him to cast aside those who desired him based on his "superior" position.
- **Orsino (the Duke) and Olivia**: Orsino is the subordinate of the two pseudonarcissists in their relationship. His sense of defeat brings about his anti-feminine resentment.
- The example of Orsino and Olivia supports Girard's thesis that there is no fundamental difference between male and female desire.

**Girard's Thesis on Gender Equality and Women as Scapegoats**
- **Girard's thesis**: Rejecting the gender specificity of desire, emphasizing the equality of man and woman.
- This emphasis on gender equality is untenable for understanding the role of women as victims in society.

**Women as Victims and Archaic Religions**
- **Archaic goddesses**: Frequent emergence due to the prevalence of original female scapegoats, with many myths depicting divinized women functioning as sacrificial victims for their cultures.
- The matriarchal thesis of ancient civilizations being characterized by peace and egalitarian relations has been criticized, as evidence of human sacrifice dating back to the Minoan period has emerged.

**Medea Myth Reinterpretation**
- **Christa Wolf**: Uses Girard's mimetic theory to reinterpret the Medea myth, casting a critical gaze on contemporary social crisis and scapegoating practices.
- Wolf's interpretation is a project from a feminist perspective that Girard's theory calls for.

**Women as Scapegoats in Collective Violence**
- **Exclusion of women from primitive cultural violence**: Women, as the weaker sex, were perpetually exposed to being selected as sacrificial victims due to their physical weakness.
- **Mythical feminization of collective violence**: Mythical examples depict women as particularly bloodthirsty, such as the Germanic Valkyries, Amazons, vengeful Erinyes, Maenads, and Bacchae.
- The prevalent primitive taboo of menstrual blood also relates to this mythical confluence of femininity and violence.
