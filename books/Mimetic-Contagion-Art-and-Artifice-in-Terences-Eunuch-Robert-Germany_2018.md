# Mimetic Contagion Art And Artifice In Terences Eunuch Robert Germany (2016)

> When we are confronted with a work of art, what is its effect on us? In contrast to post-Enlightenment conceptions, which tend to restrict themselves to aesthetic or discursive responses, the ancient Greeks and Romans often conceived works of art as having a more dynamic effect on their viewers, inspiring them to direct imitation of what they saw represented. This notion of 'mimetic contagion' was a persistent and widespread mode of framing response to art across the ancient world, discernible in both popular and elevated cultural forms, yet deployed differently in various historical contexts; it is only under the specificity of a particular cultural moment's concerns that it becomes most useful as a lens for understanding how that culture is attempting to negotiate the problems of representation.
> 
> After framing the phenomenon in terms general enough to be applicable across many periods, literary genres, and artistic media, this volume takes a particular literary work, Terence's Eunuch, as a starting point, both as a vivid example of this extensive pattern, and as a case study situating use of the motif within the peculiarities of a particular historical moment, in this case mid-second-century BC Rome and its anxieties about the power of art. One of the features of mimetic contagion frequently noted in this study is its capacity to render the operation of a particular work of art an emblem for the effect of representation more generally, and this is certainly the case in the Eunuch, whereby the painting at the centre of the play functions as a metatheatrical figure for the dynamics of mimesis throughout, illustrating how the concept may function as the key to a particular literary work. Although mimetic contagion is only one available Greco-Roman strategy for understanding the power of art, by offering an extended reading of a single work of literature through this lens, this volume demonstrates what ramifications closer attention to it might have for modern readers and literary criticism - [Mimetic Contagion Art and Artifice in Terences Eunuch Robert Germany](https://www.amazon.com/Mimetic-Contagion-Artifice-Terences-Representation/dp/0198738730?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

## Introduction

**The Eunuch's Tale: A Study on Terence's Comedy**

**Introduction:**
- The eunuch's story revolves around a central act of violence and change
- Chaerea's rape of Pamphila is the turning point, affecting all main characters
- The first half of the play was orchestrated to bring Chaerea and Pamphila together without supervision

**Act 1:**
- Phaedria, Chaerea's brother, complains about his unrequited love for Thais
- Thais reveals her plan to reunite her adopted sister, Pamphila, with her Athenian family
- Phaedria agrees to leave for two days to facilitate this deception

**Act 2:**
- Phaedria departs, leaving instructions for Parmeno to deliver the eunuch and Ethiopian girl to Thais
- Gnatho enters with Pamphila, who is meant to be a gift from Thraso
- Chaerea mistakenly believes Pamphila is in the house and tries to gain entry

**Act 3:**
- Thraso struggles to keep Thais' attention, believing she is jealous of Phaedria
- Parmeno and Chaerea disguise themselves as eunuch and Ethiopian slave girl to enter the house
- Chremes arrives from the country, suspecting Thais but assuring his innocence.


### Exploring Chaerea's justification for raping Pamphila through ancient Roman comedy and critical responses.

**Tension around Access to Thais' House**
- Both Phaedria and Thais wish to be in her house for love or to wait for Chremes
- Circumstances force them off the stage, leaving Chaerea and Pamphila unsupervised
- Everything in the first half of the play conspires to produce this configuration

**Chaerea's Crime and Jupiter's Involvement**
- Rape was not a random act but the telos towards which the first half of the play was driving
- Chaerea is a "hapless puppet" as the scheming is clearly on Terence's side
- Characters point out that everything played advantageously, suggesting providence or Jupiter's involvement
- Chaerea invokes Jupiter twice: once after the rape and again at the end of the play

**Metatheatrical Elements in Amphitruo**
- Mercury, as a character, refers to his "creator" Jupiter
- Mercury may also be understood as an actor referring to his "patron" Jupiter
- Both ontological and performative dependence become aspects of Mercury's relationship to Jupiter

**Chaerea's Rape in Eunuchus**
- Rape occurs backstage during the action of the play, not in the backstory
- Chaerea displaces significant responsibility onto the painting, which is unique in New Comedy
- Critics have generally ignored or dismissed Chaerea's description of the painting as a "disgusting prevarication"
- Terence plays against Roman taxonomic discourse and New Comedy formulae to emphasize the centrality of the painting's intervention in the plot


### Ancient mimesis and mimetic contagion: art's influence on viewers in philosophy and culture

**Chapter 1**: Investigates the effect of a painting on viewers and explores its connection to mimetic contagion as an organizing motif in Terence's Eunuch play.

**Chapters 2-3**: Explain how paintings can have such a strong influence by discussing cultic practices, erotic art, and their impact on the viewer. Emphasizes the relevance of these concepts to understanding mimetic contagion within a specific cultural moment.

**Cultic Practices**: Discussed in Chapter 2 with examples from ancient texts and artworks that involve imitation and context dependence for effect.

**Erotic Art**: Analyzed as a closely related form of persuasive analogy in Chapter 2, covering erotic literature, poetry, paintings, and their impact on young people who may be vulnerable to mimetic suggestion.

**Xenophon's Ephesiaca**: Used for comparison with the Eunuch due to its focus on an erotic image's emblematic quality and influence on imitation, particularly among young viewers.

**Mimetic Contagion in Philosophy**: Explored in Chapter 3 through Platonic and Aristotelian philosophical texts that discuss morally infectious images and their impact on the young.

**Plato's Views on Mimesis**: Examined for connections to mimetic contagion, focusing on Plato's suspicion of mimesis in Republic 3 and its relation to visual art's effect on young people.

**Aristotle's Perspective**: Discussed as having concerns about the contagious quality of deleterious artworks, particularly for the young.

**Platonic Mimesis and Mimetic Contagion**: Explored further in Chapter 3 to understand how Plato's philosophical texts relate to mimetic contagion and its impact on art and society.


### Ancient Roman comedy analysis: mime, contamination, and role reversal.

**Castration and Role Reversal in Chaerea's Experience:**
* Chaerea faces figurative and fictional emasculation throughout the play
* Figurative: begs Thais for mercy, becomes her patrona
* Fictional: Pythias announces castration but it is only symbolic
* Thais proposes to play meretrix, but her role transcends intended boundary and becomes indistinguishable from her real life

**The Rape Scene and Mime:**
* Rape scene analyzed from a different perspective in Chapter 5
* Connection between rape scene and mime: imitation and contagion effect on audience
* Mimes would copy their audience, leading to mimic imitation
* Female parts played by mimae, potentially naked or having intercourse onstage
* Chaerea's description of the painting shows confusion in roles similar to mime

**Contamination in Terence:**
* Scholarly trend to dismiss contaminatio as insignificant or irrelevant
* Argue that this perspective is influenced by political history and a narrow interpretation of the word 'contaminare' in the Terentian prologues
* Returning to early 20th century technical use of the term can better explain Terence's interest in poetics of contamination.

**Contagion and Dramatic Structure:**
* Contagion operates as a contagion within the play, influencing characters' actions and ethical paradigms
* Gnatho, the parasite, describes his flattery as imitative response and becomes a model for other characters.


### Terentian Metatheatricality

**Metatheatricality in Roman Comedy: A Shift from Plautus to Terence**

**Background:**
- No currency for metatheatricality in Roman comedy until about thirty years ago
- Oscillations in scholarly interest between Plautus and Terence
- Older distribution of prestige: Plautus = exuberant bad taste, Terence = sophisticated manners

**Shift in Perception:**
- Publication of Niall Slater's "Plautus in Performance" (1985)
- Reappraisal of artistic value of metatheatrical moments as more than lowbrow silliness
- Inverted standard of urbanity and disrupted older distribution of prestige

**Terence vs. Plautus:**
- Plautus: explicit references to theatrical trappings, jokes about dramatic conventions
- Terence: subtler forms of self-consciousness through double entendres
- No unambiguous breaking of the 'fourth wall' in Terence's plays

**Examples:**
1. **Eunuch (Terence):** Parmeno's reference to play's time constraints: subtle form of self-consciousness, ethopoetic and structurally significant
2. **Act 1:** Phaedria's plans to leave for the country for two days vs. Parmeno's warning about staying longer than one day
3. **Act 5:** Pythias' performance as a distraught slave, feigning hysteria over Chaerea's situation and blaming Parmeno
4. **Chaerea's role in the eunuch intrigue:** taking up the part Parmeno sketched for him, donning the mask that seems likely to stick
5. **Functional homology between the intrigue and the painting:** Chaerea playing the eunuch role with aggressive qualities similar to the threatening painting.


#### An analysis of metatheatricality and mimetic contagion in Terence's "Eunuch," focusing on Pythias' use of deception.

**Pythias and Parmeno's Deception**

**Background:**
- Thais was generous and eager to find a win-win solution
- Chaerea never faced any genuine danger of castration

**Pythias' Trick:**
- She made Parmeno believe he had betrayed Chaerea
- This led to the father arriving and finding his son in an eunuch outfit
- Pythias explained her laughter as witnessing a comedy (ludos)
- She thought Parmeno was clever at first but revealed his ineptitude

**Consequences:**
- Chaerea and the father were both mortified by the situation
- Parmeno had been duped into betraying both boys to their father
- Pythias couldn't contain her laughter, referring to the backstage show (ludos)

**Mimetic Contagion:**
- The use of theatrically resonant vocabulary (ludus, agere, callidus)
- Connection to the Unity of Time in Roman comedy
- Metatheatrical deployment of mimetic contagion theme throughout the play

**Importance of Mimetic Contagion:**
- Not necessarily related to metatheatricality, but becomes metatheatrical when thematized within a play
- Avoiding assumptions that all metatheatricality is universally self-identical
- Beginning with the painting and its role in the Eunuch, elucidating a broad cultural context for artworks that inspire imitation.


### Mimetic Contagion and Ekphrasis

**Mimetic Contagion and Ekphrasis**

**Ekphrasis**:
- Term from the critical vocabulary of modern scholarship relevant to the study of mimetic contagion
- Ancient pedigree, but usage differs between ancient and modern definitions
- In ancient sources:
  - Refers to descriptions of visible objects or events (artworks, crocodiles, women, seasons, harbours, etc.)
  - Emphasizes its usefulness in rendering absent objects present for the audience due to its clarity and vividness
- In modern critical parlance:
  - More specifically refers to the description of works of art
  - Vividness is not necessarily definitive of the ekphrastic mode
  - Topically narrower but contextually broader than ancient ekphrasis

**Mimetic Contagion and Ekphrasis Intersection**:
- Modern definition focuses on description of art, ancient definition emphasizes vividness and rendering absent objects present
- Archetypal ekphrasis is Homer's description of the shield of Achilles (Iliad 18.478–608)

**Ekphrasis in Ancient Education and Rhetoric**:
- Discussed in Progymnasmata, schematic handbooks for elementary education in the Roman Empire
- Difficult to determine how representative the Progymnasmata are of earlier educational practices
- Uniform language suggests received conventions from Hellenistic educational and rhetorical discourses

**Definition of Ekphrasis**:
- "A descriptive (periēgēmātikós) speech, which vividly (enargōs) brings the subject shown (dēluomenon) before the eyes (hup' ōpsin)" (Progymnasmata)
- Enargeia (vividness) separates ekphrasis from narration (diēgēsis)

**Enargeia and Ekphrasis**:
- Enargeia enables ekphrasis to render the unseen visible, turning hearers into spectators
- Defined as a speech that brings the subject shown before the eyes (Anonymous Seguerianus)
- Quintilian uses "evidentia" (Latin calque for enargeia), "illustratio", and "sub oculos subiectio" to describe the same phenomenon

**Conclusion**:
- Ekphrasis and enargeia enable ancient oratory to create a visual experience for the audience, beyond just auditory perception.


#### Ancient rhetoric: Speech as a physical force creating vivid mental images through phantasia.

**Ancient Concept of Ekphrasis: Visual Experience and Emotion**

**Ekphrasis**:
- Greek and Roman belief that vivid speech could induce hallucinations
- May be related to memory training in predominantly non-literate cultures
- Described as "speech making vision through vividness" by ancient rhetorical writers
- Seen as a physical force capable of acting on the hearer's mind and emotions

**Phantasia**:
- Greek term for the imaginative faculty that generates mental images
- Can be translated as 'mental picture', but is a rhetorical term of art
- Allows speaker to "see" what they describe, both for themselves and the audience
- Relies on compulsion and enslavement of the listener's emotions

**Quintilian's Perspective**:
- Enargeia (vivid description) is an ornamentum, an additive that enhances clear narration
- Compels the audience's attention and penetrates deep into their emotions
- Language as a physical force that can pierce defensive boundaries

**Ps.-Longinus on Phantasia**:
- Can denote any idea that generates speech
- In poetic situations, allows the poet to "see" what they describe and compel the audience to see it as well
- Importance in prose speeches for creating astonishment (ekplēxis) and enargeia.


#### Ancient concepts of mental imagery: Phantasia and enargeia in literature and rhetoric.

**Ekphrasis: The Power of Imagination in Rhetoric and Philosophy**

**Introduction:**
- Quintilian's concept of enargeia and phantasiai
- English translations vs. original Latin meaning
- Ekphrastic speech as a means of exerting control over audience's thoughts and feelings

**The Relationship between Speaker, Audience, and Characters (Ekphrasis):**
1. Speaker imagines emotional and visual world of characters
2. Speaker foists that imagined reality onto the audience
3. Both speaker and audience pulled into conformity with pattern of thought, feelings, and visual experience
4. In some cases, speaker is limited by mythological tradition or indisputable facts
5. Phantasia creates a "hall of mirrors" effect through artistic and literary creation

**Rhetorical Phantasia vs. Stoic Phantasia:**
1. Rhetorical phantasia: vivid mental imagery in rhetoric
2. Stoic phantasia: clear perception of objects or rational cogitations
3. Differences between the two conceptions
4. Overlapping assumptions about the uniformity of mental picturing
5. Ekphrastic description implies a vista of successively identical visions originating from immediate co-presence with described object
6. Rhetorical phantasia comes close to Stoic phantasia when the content is not just universally identical but also originates with clear and direct perception of object, making it objective and true in some sense.


### Introductory Epilogue

**Introductory Epilogue**

**Rembrandt's Danaë**:
- Renowned icon of sexual vulnerability
- Depicts Danaë's legs being both covered and uncovered, her body turning towards or away from the golden light
- Jupiter is not portrayed, but his presence is felt through the radiance on Danaë's bed
- A viewer's perspective is written into the painting as Jupiter/the viewer's gaze

**Vandalism of Rembrandt's Danaë**:
- In 1985, a man vandalized the painting with a knife and sulphuric acid
- The sexual character of the attack is explicit, as it targeted areas like her genitals, belly, breasts, and face
- The vandal may have assimilated to the role of Jupiter in the painting, turning the Hermitage into another "Acrisius' tower" for the rape of the painted Danaë

**Mimetic Contagion**:
- The phenomenon of mimetic contagion can be traced across ancient Mediterranean culture
- This is illustrated by the uncanny parallelism between Chaerea and the vandal who attacked Rembrandt's Danaë
- Mimetic contagion is not limited to visual art; it can also be seen in medical theories of contagion (metadosis) versus miasma

**Terence's Plays**:
- Terence's prologues are carefully structured, with narration by Chaerea beginning at line 549 and ending at line 606
- This symmetry may reflect Terence's expectation that his plays would be read privately, rather than just performed on stage
- Similar thematic and dramaturgical pairings of scenes can be found in other Terence plays

**Metatheatricality in Roman Comedy**:
- Terence's prologues are not historically accurate records, but rather playful ironic dramatic poetry
- The audience is only briefly addressed at the end of the plays, to be solicited for applause and dismissed
- The Andria's unique clausula (closing lines) ends with the standard "plaudite" (applause) command, while other plays use "valete et" (farewell)


## 1 Judging Chaerea: The Role of the Painting

**The Role of the Painting in Terence's "Andria"**

**The Genesis of Crime**:
- The mystery of the genesis of crime is one of the great mysteries of our common experience
- No two cases are exactly alike, and no two cultures approach this question with the same ethical and psychological premises

**Chaerea's Narration of the Rape**:
- Chaerea's narration of the rape is the only window on the backstage event at the center of the play
- His perspective is hopelessly partial, but it occupies a uniquely focal place in interpreting this pivotal juncture
- The text of Chaerea's ekphrastic confession is quoted, highlighting his affective response and the progression from painting to mythological subject to consummated crime

**The Relevance of the Painting**:
- Donatus provides strong confirmation that the painting marks a turning point in the events backstage
- Modern critics have generally ignored or tried to refute this testimony, possibly due to the negative perception of Chaerea's character

**Chaerea's Characterization**:
- Chaerea is a young, likable character with an impulsive, passionate, and self-centered disposition
- His verisimilitude is compared to Catullus in action and a Scandalously indecorous, irresistibly lovable character
- Some critics have referred to the rape as a "mad prank"

**Critical Reactions**:
- Older critics tended to ignore the rape and focus on Terence's brilliant craftsmanship, truth to life, and good taste
- Newer critics have generally condemned the rape and found vices in all the virtues earlier readers loved


### Text discusses character judgments on Chaerea's rape in Menander's Eunuch play. Scholars criticize his disingenuousness and depravity, questioning historical accuracy of happy ending.

**The Rape in Menander's Eunuch:** Critical Interpretations

**Character Analysis of Chaerea**:
- Norwood: raffish succulence of phrase, oversexed young man, deliberately and skillfully gratifies a physical appetite
- Parker: compulsive gregariousness, smarmy disingenuousness
- Comparison to Chérubin lacking
- Condemnation not based on rape description but Chaerea's behavior in other scenes

**Ethical Lenses**:
- Norwood: Kantian ethical lens, treat a human being as an end, not a means
- Parker: psychoanalytic ethical and descriptive system, focus on diagnosis of Chaerea's pathology of character

**Historicizing Criticism**:
- Anachronistic moral system intruding on reactions to the character
- Scholars following W. S. Anderson: insufficient absolution for such a character
- L. P. Smith: negative view due to dereliction of duty and shamefulness of disguise
- Harsh punishments anticipated by Roman audience

**Interpretation of the Painting**:
- Transparently disingenuous and dishonest justification for his actions
- Imitates Jupiter, aligns himself with king of Roman gods to provide an excuse for raping a girl
- Deliberately planned rape, not a spur-of-the-moment affair
- Rape seen as a "game" or lark by Chaerea

**Intimacy and Disappointment**:
- Chaerea envies eunuch's access to Pamphila, suggesting ultimate closeness: actual sex
- Eunuch may make it through third base but home plate is off-limits
- Donatus' comment confirms reading of ascending series of intimacy.


### An analysis of Terence's "Five Lines of Love" and the eunuch's plan in "The Eunuch" by Chaerea, involving deception and justifications for impersonation without mentioning rape.

**Donatus' Assessment of Terence's Knowledge of Five Lines of Love**
- Donatus believes Terence is alluding to the five lines of love system (quinque lineae) in his plays
- Terence keeps and diverges from these lines in different acts

**Confirmation of Donatus' Theory in Act 4, Phaedria's Speech**
- Phaedria acknowledges that love extends beyond just physical touch to encompass all aspects of connection
- The concept of five lines (prima visus, secunda alloquii, tertia tactus, quarta osculi, quinta coitus) is mentioned explicitly

**Chaerea's Fantasy and Modification of Five Lines of Love**
- Chaerea's fantasy about the eunuch follows a similar pattern: looking (visus), talking (allloquii), touching (tactus), kissing (osculi), but
  - Touching is weakened to proximity (aderit una in unis aedibus)
  - Kissing is emphasized through oral activity comparison (cibum nonnumquam capiet cum ea)
  - Sex is implied but removed with the phrase 'he will sleep hard by her' (propter dormiet)

**Significance of Modifying Five Lines of Love**
- The text adumbrates sex but cuts it out, emphasizing that love has reduced Chaerea to wanting mere presence with Pamphila
- Parmeno suggests impersonation and substitution, further emphasizing the limited nature of Chaerea's desires

**Impersonation Plan: Vengeance or Retribution?**
- The plan changes from imitating a lucky eunuch to seeking vengeance against Thais and prostitutes
- Chaerea justifies his actions as payback, but it is unclear if rape is part of what he means to accomplish
  - Some scholars argue that rape might still be involved, while others suggest it may not be the case.


### Analysis of "The Self-Torturer" by Terence: Chaerea's intentions and the use of the Latin verb 'potior'.

**The Problem of Chaerea's Intentions**

**Background**:
- Parmeno's failure to mention Pamphila's Athenian citizenship to Chaerea raises questions about the plan's innocence.
- Chaerea does not reveal his intentions until he emerges from Thais' house in Act 5, after the rape has been committed.

**Evidence Against Rape**:
- In his narration to Antipho (Act 5, 568-574), Chaerea emphasizes the innocence of the plan:
  - He fell in love with Thais' eunuch, not Pamphila.
  - He traded clothes with the eunuch to gain entry into Thais' house.
  - Antipho questions the advantage of this, to which Chaerea responds that he wanted to be near Pamphila.
- The use of "potior" (to "get" or "obtain") in relation to Pamphila does not necessarily imply rape.
  - It can also mean "to reach" or "come by," as shown in other examples from Latin literature.

**Evidence for Innocence**:
- The scholars surveyed in the text all reached the same conclusion without any explicit text-based argument, suggesting a universally shared revulsion to Chaerea's actions.

**The Importance of Context and Irony**:
- The ambiguity of Chaerea's statements may be intentional, providing dramatic irony for the audience.
  - Chaerea's plea to "get" Pamphila can be interpreted as a harmless desire to win her love, rather than a violent intention.


### Historical exploration of rape in ancient Greek and Roman literature and its contrast with modern attitudes.

**Changes in Public Consciousness and Legal Framework of Rape**
- Historically unprecedented shift in Western democracies' public consciousness of rape over last half of 20th century
- Broadened definitions, recognition of various types (date, spousal, acquaintance, statutory)
- Universal reclassification as presumptively criminal

**Feminist Debate on Nature and Significance of Rape**
- Feminist debates have become more articulate with each decade
- Revolutions in basic assumptions and goals within feminism
- Focus on formulating a way to understand rape as a locus for problematic sex, power, and gendered oppression

**Perceived Paupertas Linguarum Antiquarum (Lack of Words for Rape in Ancient Languages)**
- Greek and Latin lacked specific words for non-consensual sex
- Conveyed by more general terms for 'assault' or 'adultery', emphasizing resultant polluted state of victim, not act itself

**Modern Experience of Rape vs Ancient Constructions of Sexual Assault**
- Modern experience rooted in autonomy and selfhood, making rape a total dislocation of identity
- Foucault's claim of modern self emergent in discourses of sexual (self-)control
- Cahill: Rape destroys intersubjective agency and personhood for women

**Rape as Plot Motif in New Comedy**
- Overwhelming frequency of rape as a plot motif
- Functioned as 'courtship practice' where rapist is the lead character
- Rape occurred beforehand, resulting in an untimely pregnancy or abandonment
- Happy endings: assailant returns to bride or wedding takes place again

**Narrative Function of Night-Time Festival Context in New Comedy**
- Situates event within carnivalesque atmosphere of license and inversion of norms
- Provides a handy solution for ethical depiction, dramatic verisimilitude
- Denatures rape as brutal crime and refashions it into a semiotic token.


### Ancient Greek comedy: Excusing rapists through night festivals and drunkenness.

**Night-time Festivals and Drunkenness in Ancient Greek Comedy**

**Rape Narratives**:
- Rape is frequently depicted in connection with night-time festivals and drunkenness
- This is likely to mitigate the rapist's guilt and shift the blame
- The rapist's "diminished capacity" is an exculpatory factor, making them "not accountable for their actions"

**Examples**:
- **Onesimos in the Epitrepontes**: Raped a girl during a night-time festival, which was "obvious" (δηλαδή)
- **Hegio's Justification**: "Night, love, wine, youth persuaded him—it's only human"
- **Lyconides in the Aulularia**: Claims it was a god that led him to rape Euclio's daughter, as he was drunk and young

**Absence of Elements**:
- The Samia and Hecyra do not explicitly mention the festival context or alcohol, but both are implied
- The Eunuch has neither element

**Chaerea in the Eunuch**:
- Raped Pamphila during a "real part" of the play, not neatly sequestered in the past
- This, and his sobriety, is damning in the eyes of ancient and modern interpretations
- However, this perspective changes when the rape is seen as a "literary topos" rather than a real crime


### Augustine's criticism of classical literature's corrupting influence through the example of Terence's "Eunuch" scene

**The Ethical Work Accomplished by Night-Time Festival Motif:**
- Protects victim's reputation: gives her an excuse for being out at night
- Helps account for young man's loss of control: drunkenness facilitates lack of recognition and explanation

**The Role of the Painting in New Comedy:**
- Slips into role left empty by absence of 'religious event' and 'alcohol'
- Offers clarification that perpetrator's state of mind was jumbled by something physically real and external

**Augustine's Critique of Classical Pagans Literature:**
- Regrets his childhood love for tales from Homer and Virgil
- Condemns educational frivolity in declamatory exercises
- Apostrophizes 'hellish river of human custom' that advertises itself as source of rhetorical art
- Criticizes the effect of these texts on young people, using Terence's play 'The Eunuch' as an example:
  - Words learned through depravity, not necessitated by it
  - Words become 'decanners of the wine of error' rather than just a false pretext for seduction


### Analysis of Chaerea's character and Terence's Eunuch play's influence on Augustine's downfall. Discussion of interpretations, morality, and implications for ancient comedy.

**Terence's Play "The Eunuch" and Its Impact:**
* Chaerea's character: nequam adulescentem or morally corrupting influence?
	+ Confessions vs City of God interpretations
		- Confessions: subtle suggestion of Terence's influence on Augustine
		- City of God: explicit focus on play's ruinous effect on young audiences
* Chaerea not morally spotless before seeing the painting
* Well-placed work of art can provide strong incitement for imitation for souls already enfeebled by sin

**Interpretations of "The Eunuch" Scene:**
* Donatus' interpretation: reference to bride preparation as a mitigation of Chaerea's crime
	+ Philippides agreement and extension
* Bowdlerization of Roman comedy, including The Eunuch
* Actors and audiences involved in performances

**Literary Connections:**
* Shakespeare's connection to "The Eunuch" (Twelfth Night)
* Other English avatars: Gascoigne's The Supposes, Sir Charles Sedley’s Bellamira, or The Mistress, Thomas Cooke’s The Eunuch, or the Darby Captain

**Philosophical Connections:**
* Freudian intellectual genealogy in Kant
* Debate on legal definition of rape: violence vs. dominance/submission dynamic
	+ Brownmiller (1975): rape as violence and degradation
	+ MacKinnon (1989) and Dworkin (1989): rape as unmasking the violence in all intercourse between men and women
* Contemporary conversation on rape: Cahill (2001)

**Greek and Latin Vocabulary:**
* Words for assault: bia (Greek), comprimere, stuprare (Latin)
* Shaming or outrage words: hubris (Greek), vitiiare (Latin)
* Spousal rape classification: moicheia (Greek)

**Impact of "The Eunuch" on Literature and Thought:**
* Greek lexical equivalent for rape not problematized in the same way as today
* Coerced sexual intercourse contextualized differently in Athenian society.


## 2. Quickening Images: Mimetic Contagion in Cultic and Erotic Art

**Mimetic Contagion in Cultic and Erotic Art**

**Chapter Overview**:
- Explains why ancient audiences may have attributed more power to the painting in Terence's play "Eunuch" than modern critics
- Discusses the concept of "mimetic contagion" - the effectual power of images that replicate themselves in their viewers
- Examines the cultural background and discursive practices that feed into the conceit of artefacts shaping the world in their own image
- Locates the effects of the painting in the Eunuch within a broader Greco-Roman context, mid-second-century bce Rome, and the genre of Roman comedy

**Mimetic Contagion**:
- Represents a reversal of the presumed ontological order of similarity
- Suggests the image has the means for its own further propagation through "hosts"
- Particularly evident when the image is a representational artefact embedded in another work of art
- Can lead to a vertiginous expansion of the image and mimesis itself

**Related Concepts**:
- **Frazer's Law of Sympathy and Law of Contact**: Describes how "primitive thinking" views objects as having the power to shape reality
- **Jakobson's metaphor and metonymy**: Describes how images can conflate these linguistic concepts

**Cultural Background**:
- Frazer's "cunning and malignant savages" are shown to be more like us than assumed
- Benjamin and Adorno demonstrated that even higher cognitive functions are shot through with the mimetic impulse
- Art-historical investigation has confirmed the validity of these views, e.g., the power of images in "voodoo dolls" practices

**Ancient Examples**:
- Public and civic representations where viewers were intended to see their models (e.g., Medusa)
- Defixiones: Private practices where the emphasis is on the passions of the image, leading to changes in the viewer or prototype


### Ancient art's ability to induce terror and arousal through images: gorgoneia, oscilla, erotic paintings.

**Gorgoneia and Oscilla:**
- **Gorgoneia**: terror masks used in ancient Greece on temple façades, shields, ships, workshops, and household ware to confront victim directly and induce panic and paralysis
- Bugged-out eyes and distended rictus give terrified look, causing same reaction in the hostile viewer
- Victim mirrors image's lifelessness as they mirror its expression
- Medusa, a living statue with bronze hands and gold wings, may have inspired these terror masks
- Romans had equivalent apotropaic masks called oscilla

**Apotropaic Techniques:**
- Spontaneously developed across historical and cultural continuum of ancient Mediterranean world
- No clear boundary between magic and art in antiquity

**Art and Space:**
- Romans decorated interiors with painted construction materials, walks with landscapes, and matched image to intended use
- Erotic images used in cubicula (rooms) for amusement or to encourage enactment of scenes

**Erotic Images:**
- Spanned all strata of Roman society from humble brothels to elite residences
- Intended functions include simple amusement, advertising owner's refinement, and arousing viewer

**Didactic Tradition:**
- Hellenistic erotic handbooks described various sexual positions
- Ovid's Ars Amatoria provided didactics on love, ending with survey of sexual positions for female reader
- Painting or tabella referred to as an index of positions, not a single frame erotic painting.

**Defense of Erotic Poetry:**
- Ovid defends Ars Amatoria by comparing it to other didactic poetry on light and pernicious themes
- Mimes also addressed in this context, with no clear distinction made between morally contagious performance and didactic erotic painting.


### Ovid's Tristia 2: Defending Obscene Poetry through Art Comparison

**The Corrupting Influence of Theatrical Entertainment: Ovid's Argument Against Augustus**

**Background:**
- Ovid defends Ars amatoria against accusations of indecency
- Mime is considered morally contagious, but so is Ovid's poetry (501, 511)
- Augustus presents mimes and Ovid's poems to the people (513)

**Effect on Audience:**
- Mime corrupts spectators through visual and aural assault (497, 503-504)
- Augustus is an impressionable reader and careless judge of morality (511)

**Comparing Mime to Ovid's Poetry:**
- Both have the same effect on audience (520)
- Ars amatoria is defended by analogy to erotic painting (521)

**Domestic Erotic Painting:**
- Parallels with mime and Ars amatoria in content and effect (25)
- Introduced as a ubiquitous visual practice or an ironic emblem of Rome's depravity?

**Historical Context:**
- Domestic use of erotic images is not novel but recurrently mythologized (23, 26)

**Ovid's Defence of Ars Amatoria:**
- Misreadings undermine defence and implicate Augustus as corruptor (501, 511)
- Ars amatoria compared to erotic painting for defence or irony (521)

**Mime and Ovid's Poetry: Comparison and Effect on Audience:**
- Both corrupt spectators through aural and visual means (497, 503-504)
- Augustus presents both mimes and Ovid's poems to the people (511, 513)
- Ars amatoria defended by analogy to erotic painting (521) or submitted as an inspirational form intended for direct imitation?

**Impact on Modern Understanding:**
- The myth of a fall from early Roman artistic restraint or aniconism has cultural and political force at various times in Roman history. (23, 26)


### Discusses the moral impact of erotic paintings in Roman society: corruption versus artistic expression.

**Erotic Painting in Ancient Rome**

**Cynthia's Temple and Erotodidacticism**:
- Cynthia is not a virginal bride, but rather a woman with many suitors
- Ovid uses erotodidactic painting to excuse himself, Augustus, and the Romans
- Propertius mentions erotic painting for moral reflection on societal decline, but it's irrelevant to his affair with Cynthia

**Erotic Painting in Roman Society**:
- Erotic paintings were commonly found in brothels, possibly as catalogues of sexual positions
- Tiberius decorated bedrooms with provocative paintings and statuettes for his sex partners
- The erotic painting in the House of the Centenary in Pompeii is a common theme in Roman art

**Erotic Painting as Didactic Aid**:
- Ovid's "parva tabella" was likely a small, provocative painting in a bedroom
- Tiberius' erotic paintings were explicitly intended for sexual imitation
- The erotic painting in the House of the Centenary may have been a painted-within-a-painting, similar to nested artistic response

**Conclusion**:
- Erotic painting was a widespread phenomenon in Roman society, used in various contexts from brothels to elite homes.


### Erotic paintings with mirrored reflections: woman's perspective and dimensionality in ancient Roman art.

**The House of the Centenary: Erotic Art and Visual Perspective**

**Description of the Room (43) and its Contents:**
- Couple's attention occupied by a painting on north wall
- Painting depicts mulier equitans position with man leaning on elbow
- Woman facing away from her lover
- Dark rectangle on back wall, left side
- Scholars refer to it as camera d’amore due to two similar erotic paintings in one room

**Analysis of Paintings:**
- Possible significances: intended for sex or teasing response
- Women depicted as potential viewers of art
- Mulier equitans position implies woman's activity and autonomy
- Shift in placement of mise en abîme emphasizes visibility for women

**Parallel Examples from Roman Antiquity:**
- Mirror found on Palatine with erotic images
- Woman twists around to kiss man
- Shuttered panel behind them reveals another erotic image
- Similarities: rear-entry positions, woman looking back at lover, line of sight towards painting within room

**Significance of Mirror:**
- Women's cubiculum and expected lover presence
- Dimensional play: notional painting upgraded to semi-three dimensionality
- Woman recognizes herself in mirror, becoming the woman in the image
- Reversal of polarity in lovers' positions.


### Mimetic Contagion in the Ephesiaca

**Mimetic Contagion in the Ephesiaca**

**Survey of Cultic and Erotic Objects**:
- Recreate themselves in the behavior of the notional viewer
- Examples: real artworks, attested types, literary creations
- Mimetic contagion in Ovid and Propertius

**The Scene in Ephesiaca**:
- Newly wedded Habrocomes and Anthia gaze at erotic mythical representation on marriage bed canopy
- Ares and Aphrodite being brought together by Eros for their tryst portrayed on the canopy

**Parity between Couples**:
- Human lovers' chamber decorated with similar imagery as gods
- Unclear if function is predictive or persuasive

**Bildeinsätze in Ancient Novels**:
- Frequent and focal in surviving ancient novels
- Warn characters of impending future or intervene directly in the 'real' world

**Example: Painting of Andromeda (Aethiopica)**:
- Description propagates itself in queen's body
- Suggests broader pattern of ekphrastic contagion in the novel

**Metapoetic Aspect**:
- Unusual conception related to queen's interaction with painting
- Artifactuality, narration, and interpretation converge

**Canopy Ekphrasis in Ephesiaca**:
- Similar dynamics as Demodocus' song in Odyssey
- Habrocomes recognizes metapoetic function

**Anthia's Transformation**:
- Assimilated to Artemis at the beginning
- New divine model provided by image on canopy after marriage


#### Ancient novel explores the power of Eros in love story with artistic descriptions and optical infection.

**Anthia and Habrocomes' Transformation:**
* Anthia's transformation from Artemis to Aphrodite:
  * Rides a stirruped horse (strouthoi)
  * Brings flowers in anticipation of defloration
  * Shift in character, becoming sexually aggressive towards Habrocomes
* Corresponds to her objective change of station and ethical makeover
* Novel prepares readers for the critical role this image plays
* Opening description of Habrocomes as beautiful and rejection of Eros
* Anthia and Habrocomes' mutual attraction upon seeing each other
* Infection through vision, physicalist psychology
* Canopy ekphrasis leading to erotic context and divine intervention

**Eros' Role in the Novel:**
* Drives plot forward as retribution for Habrocomes' pride
* Unnamed but dominant force determining course of their life
* Revealed in visible form on the canopy
* Threatens to come true in unexpected ways throughout the novel.


#### Comparing ancient literature and mythology: adultery, art, and identification in Greek novels and beyond.

**Misinterpretation of Aphrodite's Role in Habrocomes and Anthia's Story**
- In the Ephesiaca novel, Habrocomes and Anthia's story is compared to the tale of Ares and Aphrodite on the canopy
- However, their story involves adultery, which is inappropriate for a marriage bed
- This theme is not coincidental but peculiarly fitting given their fate

**Identification of Habrocomes and Anthia with Ares and Aphrodite**
- Straightforward identification of the two pairs is problematic due to the nature of their story (adultery)
- Similarities between their tale and the story on the canopy hint at future torments
- Canopy represents and enforces the god's triumph, as it locks Habrocomes and Anthia into their future roles

**Primitive Mentality and Magical Thinking**
- Frazer's belief in primitive mentality and mimetisches Vermögen (imitative capacity) as a unique trait of primitive peoples has been refuted
- Modern ethnographers no longer believe in radically different modes of thought for primitive peoples
- Adorno and Benjamin emphasize the importance of mimeticity in art, which allows viewers to identify themselves with the work and find resolution through it.


#### An exploration of Medusa's terrifying head and its impact on ancient Greek art, literature, and culture.

**Medusa's Head: Fear and Transformation**

**Background:**
- Medusa's head is a powerful symbol of fear and transformation in Greek mythology
- Described as terrifying, lethal, and capable of turning viewers into stone

**Mythological Significance:**
- Appears on Athena's shield, causing metaphorical petrification for viewers
- Priestess turned to stone upon seeing Medusa's head in a sanctuary

**Symbolism:**
- Connected to the god Dionysus and his followers, known as satyrs (16)
- Represented on Roman masks called oscilla (17)

**Ovid's Ars Amatoria:**
- Medusa's head is mentioned in book 2, emphasizing fear and transformation
- Connection to Gallus' erotodidaxis suggested by scholars (28)
- Possible allusion to Menander's Thais or Terence's Eunuch (30)

**Visual Representation:**
- Depicted in Roman art, such as the Suburban Baths (31) and on sex manuals (19)
- Used for teaching purposes or amusement, depending on context

**Erotic Education:**
- Ovid's Ars Amatoria teaches men about love and seduction
- Medusa's head appears as a metaphor for the potential consequences of erotic missteps
- Erotic positions depicted in Roman art may have been based on these texts.


## 3. Lifelike Likeness: Mimetic Contagion in the Philosophical Tradition

**Mimetic Contagion in the Philosophical Tradition**

**Xenophon's Socrates on Mimetic Contagion**:
- Socrates is interested in verisimilitude and how it affects viewers through mimetic contagion
- Elite painting, specifically veristic elite painting, is a focus of this interest

**Plato's Treatment of Mimesis**:
- Plato's Socrates is less focused on artistic skill, but interested in the problem of representation and how images replicate themselves in viewers

**Mimetic Contagion in Ancient Discourse**:
- Lifelike images can fool birds into trying to eat or humans into sympathizing with the subject's pain
- Parrhasius' painting of Prometheus' suffering may lead viewers to experience that suffering in reality

**Verisimilitude and Mimesis as Parallel Cultural Phenomena**:
- Lifelikeness is largely dependent on the beholder's cultural context
- Pliny's stories about artists like Pythagoras of Rhegium demonstrate how naturalistic technique can evoke sympathetic responses in viewers

**The Problem of Verisimilitude in Modern Visual Theory**:
- The perception of representational "lifelikeness" is more cultural than natural
- Ancient practices and experiences associated with copying reality in art may be difficult to understand from a modern perspective


### Mimetic Contagion and (Platonic) Mimesis

**Mimetic Contagion and (Platonic) Mimesis**

**The Concept of Mimesis**:
- Mimēsis is a central concept in Platonic and Aristotelian discussions of art
- Continued to play a pivotal role in Renaissance and Neoclassical thinking about art
- Rejected by Romantic and post-Romantic aesthetic regimes, but the concept remains significant

**Mimesis vs. Imitation**:
- The Greek word "mimēsis" is connected to "mimos", which denotes theatrical mime and actors
- The meaning of "mimesis" extends beyond theatrical mime to a sense of "similarity" or "likeness"
- Plato used "mimesis" in various ways, including as world-reflecting and world-creating

**Mimesis 1 and Mimesis 2**:
- **Mimesis 1**: Copying a model, either in performative action or as an artistic product
- **Mimesis 2**: Producing an autonomous artistic creation, approaching "fiction"
- Mimesis 1 is more relevant to mimetic contagion, while mimesis 2 can still be relevant

**Mimetic Contagion and Mimesis**:
- Mimetic contagion inverts the usual directionality of mimesis 1, with the artwork as the model
- Mimesis 2 is also relevant, as the artwork's fiction now includes the viewer who is effectively part of the fashioned world
- Mimetic contagion represents a perversion of mimesis, but this threat was always latent in the Greek understanding of mimesis

**Plato's Critique of Mimesis**:
- Plato had reservations about the role of mimetic arts in the well-run city
- His critique can be grouped into two categories: falsehood and ethical corruption


#### Plato's Republic: Mimetic Contagion and Censorship in Poetry and Performances

**Plato's Republic: Mimesis in Greek Poetry and Its Impact on Young People**

**Background:**
- Plato's critique of mimesis not directly relevant to mimetic contagion but some parts may be related.
- Dangers of traditional Greek poetry for young people discussed in the Republic (books 2-3).

**Effects of Traditional Poetry:**
- Young people may learn bad behaviors from misrepresented gods and heroes.
- Can lead to proclivity towards wickedness.
- Importance of avoiding theological errors and focusing on virtue.

**Mimesis vs. Diēgēsis:**
- Distinction between telling (diēgēsis) and showing (mimesis).
- Mimesis: imitation in performance, such as tragedy or comedy; can be dangerous if it becomes the performer's real character.
- Both forms have implications for mimetic contagion discussion.

**Moral Argument against Mimesis:**
- Performers may become overly attached to roles and adopt them as their own (real character).
- Danger of imitation leading to unruly behavior that lasts beyond performance.
- Applicable to visual arts as well as poetry for both performers and audience members.

**Determining What's Allowed in Ideal City:**
- Based on harmony, grace, and intelligent order.
- Not exclusive to poetry; applies to all forms of art (sculpture, architecture, etc.).
- Mimetic contagion concept has relevance for performers and audience alike.


#### Plato's Republic: Regulating Art for the Common Good

**Plato's Regulation of Artistic Mimesis in The Republic**

**Importance of Regulating Mimesis**:
- Painting, weaving, embroidery, architecture, and other crafts exhibit gracefulness or gracelessness
- Gracelessness is kin to bad character and language, while the opposite promotes a prudent and noble character
- Regulation of poets and other craftsmen necessary to prevent negative influence on impressionable people

**Effects of Negative Mimesis**:
- Irrational accumulation of wickedness in one's soul from exposure to images of evil
- Young, respectable, and best among us susceptible to this effect
- Pleasure and pity felt for morally questionable characters nourishes irrational impulses
- What we enjoy passes from others to ourselves

**Plato's View on Dramatic Mimesis**:
- Distinction between performer's self-likening (book 3) and audience's emotional response (book 10)
- Socrates conflates the effects in book 10, claiming what we enjoy becomes our own
- Both performers and spectators ethically assimilated to the character

**Significance of 401a–d3 Passage**:
- Generalization of artistic mimesis as a problem, not limited to dramatic mimesis
- Focus on visual art rather than drama, which is also a form of mimesis
- Plato's primary concern is the tendency of art to exceed boundaries and infect those who come into contact with it

**Conclusion**:
- Plato does not aim to create a unified theory or isolate mimetic contagion in these passages
- His criticisms of mimesis include ontological fallacy, traditional errors, and tendency to infect those who come into contact with it
- Plato's views on art may have evolved over time, as shown by approving comments in later works.


#### Plato's Timaeus: Blending Mimetic Contagion and Cosmogony

**Plato's Views on Mimesis: Republic vs. Poetics**

**Background:**
- Plato wrote dialogues with a dramatic form
- Some characters portrayed are not to be emulated
- Philosophy seen as comparable social practice
- Mimesis in Republic 3 and 10: harsh judgments on mimesis, but possibly logical conclusions or thought experiment

**Aristotle's Response:**
- Poetics: rehabilitates art from Plato's critique in Republic
- Mimesis can evoke passionate responses (pity and fear)
- Purgation (katharsis): beneficial role of audience response to mimesis
- Different understanding of mimesis 1 (reflecting world) vs. mimesis 2 (creating autonomous fictional world)
- No direct connection between mimesis and imitation in Poetics
- Benefits and risks of mimetic contagion side-stepped

**Plato's Timaeus:**
- Continuation of Republic's discussion on ideal state
- Socrates: unable to depict the ideal city dynamically
- Criticism towards poets' ability to imitate perfection
- Story of Atlantis and its contest with the ideal city (Athens)
- Timaeus' description of physical universe, Critias continues with Atlantis story.

**Key Points:**
- Plato: harsh judgments on mimesis in Republic but affirming views in other texts
- Aristotle: rehabilitated art from Plato's critique through Poetics
- Blended concepts of mimesis 1 (reflecting world) and mimesis 2 (creating autonomous fictional world)
- Critias' response to Socrates' complaint about the inability of mimetic clan to represent ideal polis.


#### Timaeus' account: Cosmos as divine artistic imitation of unchanging Forms

**Timaeus' Account of the World as a Mimesis of the Forms**
- The world of experience is a mimesis (imitative copy) of the eternal, changeless world of the Forms
- The phenomenal world is not incidentally similar to the ideal world, but intentionally created by the Demiurge as an artistic copy
- The model (paradeigma) is eternal, real, intelligible, uniform, and alive, so the Demiurge fashioned the sensible world into its likeness
- The universe of our experience is a "copy of the model" (mimesis), but this eikōn (image) is itself a perceptible god
- The possibility that the Demiurge's mimesis of the ideal may inspire further imitation as a visible model (mimetic contagion)
- The children of the Demiurge imitate his power and the perfect celestial world he created, mirroring its structure in the human body
- Our bodies are a mimesis of the cosmos, allowing us to resonate with its design even apart from the operation of the intellect
- We have a moral duty to maximize our conformity to the cosmic order by studying the heavens and understanding their order

**Relationship between Timaeus' Speech and the Atlantis Story**
- Timaeus' speech is an extended interruption of the Atlantis story, told at Critias' prompting and following his specifications
- The relationship of Timaeus' speech to the surrounding frame is oddly similar to the terrestrial world's relationship to the celestial cause/model
- The Atlantis story descends through time from the legendary Egyptian sages to the semi-legendary lawgiver of Athens to the Athenian world, mirroring the paradigm's descent from ideal to celestial to terrestrial


#### Plato's Timaeus-Critias: Mimesis, Cosmos, and Art's Role

**The Significance of Mimesis in Plato's Timaeus-Critias**

**Background:**
- Critias describes the Atlantis story as a marvelous tale he learned as a child, deeply ingrained in his memory (26c).
- He emphasizes its pleasurable nature and repeated request from an old man.

**Mimesis in Timaeus' Speech:**
- Timaeus' account and Critias' own retelling are characterized as necessary "imitation and copy" of the truth (107b).
- Mimesis plays a significant role in understanding the cosmos, with both speeches being evaluated for their faithfulness to reality.

**Plato's Critique of Mimesis:**
- In the Republic, Plato expressed skepticism towards mimesis due to potential mimetic contagion (19d).
- However, Timaeus and Critias argue that mimesis is essential for understanding the cosmos.

**The Role of Mimesis in Art:**
- Aristotle's answer to Plato's critique of mimesis focuses on its psychological benefits but overlooks mimetic contagion (Poetics).
- Plato's late work, Timaeus-Critias, addresses the issue of mimetic contagion and rehabilitates mimesis as central to the operation of the world.

**The Influence of Plato's Ideas:**
- The Timaeus influenced later thinkers, especially in late antiquity and the Middle Ages, with its concept of phenomenal world as a mimesis of ideal world.
- The Republic disturbed complacent assumptions about art being benignly passive, providing conceptual tools for exploring unrulier side of mimesis.

**Oscar Wilde's 'The Decay of Lying':**
- Writes in the form of a Platonic dialogue with reference to Plato and the Republic.
- Valorizes mendacity in art as providing relief from reality and shaping human behavior through artistic imitation.
- Vivian argues that Art transcends and transforms the world, creating its own reality (189).

**Luce Irigaray's 'Plato's Hystera':**
- Draws connections between Plato's cave and the womb as matrices of mimetic production.
- The cave, being secondary to the real world of Forms, is similar to the latter (hysteron).


#### Plato's Cave, Irigaray's interpretation, and the concept of mimesis (imitation) in philosophy and art.

**The Cave and Mimesis (Plato's Allegory)**

**The Womb and the Cave**:
- The cave represents a physical space where people live, facing a back wall with shadowy images in front
- The womb is the temporally prior space for all human life, like the cave it contains imitations of an originating agency
- The instability of hysteron (back) and proteron (front) in the womb/cave expands to the instability of copy and original as one moves from inside to outside

**Mimesis and Representation**:
- Mimesis is the unrepresentable mode of existence that cannot be shown directly
- Representation itself can only be represented transitively, through a chain of imitations (e.g., an actor copying a drunk or a painter copying a flower)
- The cave figuratively represents this hidden, blind matrix where likenesses are born and spawn new likenesses

**Plato's Cave vs. Irigaray's Interpretation**:
- Plato's allegory of the cave is about the unrepresentable nature of mimesis
- Irigaray's reading is a "boldest reappropriation" that resonates with elements latent in Plato's account
- Her focus on mimesis as the unstated but peculiar activity of the cave and the instability of mimetic contagion are profoundly Platonic

**Mimesis in Art and Philosophy**:
- **Parrhasius**: Known for his extreme skill in graphic line drawing, called the "prince of artists"
- Verisimilitude: The problem of how to evaluate the relationship between art and reality
- Mimesis as a response to serially isolated aspects of the ancient tradition, explored in modern critical discourse


#### Plato's Republic: Mimesis, Art, and Criticism in Philosophy and Literature. This passage discusses Plato's views on mimesis (imitation) in his work Republic, its relation to art and poetry, and criticisms against it by scholars.

**Plato's View on Mimesis**

**Two Complaints about Mimesis:**
- Criticism of mimesis as overly anthropomorphic in Greek myth (linked to criticism of gods)
- Concerns about the impact of mimesis on audience and performers

**Distinction between Types of Mimesis:**
- Plato's mimesis process: upstream (mimesis 1), downstream (mimesis 3), creative act itself (mimesis 2)
- Distinguishes between different aspects of the mimesis concept

**Mimesis in Plato's Works:**
- Book 3 and Book 10 of Republic discuss mimesis differently: performers vs. audience
- Scholars debate on unity of mimesis in these books
- Some argue for a unified definition, others focus on differences

**Platonic Revision of Poetic Wisdom:**
- Pre-Socratic critique of gods as overly anthropomorphic extends to Plato's hostility towards mimesis
- Plato may be intensifying this pre-existing tradition

**Environmental Materialism in Plato's Passage:**
- Situated within larger cultural context and project

**Conflation vs. Excluding Mimesis from Definitions:**
- Scholars have debated whether to include or exclude mimesis in its definition based on Plato's works

**Plato's Criticism of Poetic Mimesis:**
- More absolute dismissal in book 10 compared to book 3
- Some argue he only means to banish bad, morally deleterious mimesis
- Others believe he intends to exclude all poetic mimesis

**Plato's Model of Mimesis:**
- Grounded in painting but can apply to other art forms as well
- Painting is harmless and trivial compared to poetry, which must be forbidden due to its deceptiveness

**Aristotle's Perspective on Mimesis:**
- Treats mimesis as a cognitive process and means of knowing in the first instance

**Relationship between Atlantis Story and Cosmology:**
- Interpretations vary: some see it as a parable about unnatural pleonexia being frustrated, others argue for connection to the Timaeus cosmology.


## 4. Mimetic Contagion in Terence’s Rome

**Mimetic Contagion in Terence's Rome: Roman Funeral Rituals as Exemplars of Ethical Influence**

**Background:**
- Rome's educational role of images in society
- Concern with practical questions of pedagogy
- Institutional form through Roman funerals (Polybius, Ep. 2.1.156–7)

**Role of Images in Roman Funerals:**
- Displayed as artistic images and masks (εἰκών)
- Carefully crafted to resemble the deceased (εἰς ὁμοιότητα διαφερόντως ἐξειργασμένον)
- Worn by men who resemble the subjects in body type and performance
- Placed in most conspicuous locations (ἐπιφανέστατον)

**Function of Funeral Rituals:**
- Create continuity between life and death
- Inspire young men through stories of ancestors' exploits
- Establish active spectation from one generation to the next

**Horatius Cocles as Exemplar:**
- Inspired by expectation of future renown ( τὴν ἐσομένην μετὰ ταῦτα περὶ αὐτὸν εὔκλειαν)
- Similar to the Roman funeral, where young men are spectators and expected to become prominent (ἐπιφανής)
- Connection between Horatius and the family imagoes (εἰκών)
- Honorary statues of Horatius in Rome (comitium, Sacred Way)

**Significance:**
- Popular Roman discourse on exemplarity in art
- Positive understanding of ethically contagious effect on young
- Detrimental effects of images also acknowledged
  - Numa's ban on gods' painted or sculptural images (Plutarch, Numa 8.7–8)


### Roman Religion and the corrupting influence of Greek art: Aniconism and the sack of Syracuse.

**Roman Religion and Aniconism:**
- Myth of Roman religious aniconism is debunked as fanciful
- Originates from Varro's writings
- Coordinated with moralistic criticism of later corruption in religion

**Impact of Greek Art on Rome:**
- Introduced after Marcellus' sack of Syracuse (211 BCE)
- Associated with luxury and idleness
- Persuasive due to lifelike representation and ability to remake Romans in image of Greeks
- Disregard for provenance, leading to imitation of teacher's love of art and disregard for propriety.

**Impact of Greek Art on Roman Gods:**
- Roman gods perceived as less sacred after introduction of Greek art
- Fear that imported images possess Romans, causing them to lose connection with their old deities
- Cato's view: Marcellus' spoils from Syracuse were "infesta" or poisonous for Rome.

**Historical Context:**
- Livy's perspective on Greek art in Rome goes back long before Plutarch
- Consistent with mid-second century traditionalist rhetoric
- Polybius shares similar apprehension towards the imported art from Syracuse.


### Art in Roman Comedy

**Plautus' Attitudes Towards Art in Roman Comedy**

**Perfection and Imitation in Plautus' Plays:**
- Images or figurative arts mentioned to indicate perfection or unqualified success (graphicus)
  - Metaphorical use of the term 'graphicus' for trickery and rightness
  - Perfection in art surpassing truth itself (Epid., Pers.)
- Scenes compared to paintings, not limited to visible aspects

**Plautus vs. Plato on Figurative Arts:**
- Contrast between Plautus' positive view of images and Plato's rejection

**Examples of Comparing Life to Art:**
1. Epidicus (622–4): Telestis described as picture-perfect in appearance, comparison based on outward appearance
2. Poenulus (1271–3): Agorastocles' longing for a painted scene of reunited family, hidden similarity between characters
3. Mercator (313–15): Lysimachus compares Demipho to a painted lover based on character, metatheatrical reference
4. Mostellaria: Tranio's ekphrasis of a painting (829–830) describing a crow tricking two vultures. The audience is directly addressed as spectators and the referent of 'crow' slips between character and actor.


### Eunuch

**The Power of Persuasive Art in Ancient Rome: The Eunuch**

**Preoccupation with Ethically Persuasive Art**
- Greek and Roman discourses on works of art that impress viewers as models
- Mid-second-century bce Roman culture and its attitudes towards painting

**The Painting as a Mimetic Contagion**
- Implicit relationship between the painting and drama
- Drama's unique status as both visual art form and literary literature
- Transmedial analogy between "mimetic" arts: poetry and painting (ut pictura poesis)

**The Painting in Terence's Eunuch**
- Self-awareness of theatre-as-art in the play
- Mise en abîme at the heart of the play
- Recursive autosimilarity: painting oversteps its frame and becomes real

**Play-within-the-Play and Theatrical Vocabulary**
- Chaerea's exploit compared to Jupiter's: spectacular and ludic aspect
- Phaedria recognizes comic subterfuge behind mistaken identity
- Pythias' recognition of Parmeno as the auctor (dramatic author)

**Identity Deception and Theatrical Dimension in Comedy**
- Change of vestment and attention to Chaerea’s eunuch costume
- Improvisational theatre: Chaerea's acting brings personal happiness and a positive outcome for Phaedria
- Difficulties with ascribing improvisational mode to this scene.


#### The Trickster's Deception and the Role of Chaerea's Rape in Menander's Eunuch.

**The Rape Scene in "The Eunuch" Play**

**Unexpected Developments**:
- Something unexpected comes up that requires the trickster (Chaerea) to adapt and keep the deception going
- The frivolous departures from plan may come close to wrecking the deception, but never actually do so

**Comedic Elements**:
- Visual pleasure of watching Chaerea's "virtuoso plasticity" as he adapts to new contingencies
- Witty evocation of unscripted popular entertainment (e.g., Atellan farce, Commedia dell'arte)
- The visual dimension lost when the rape is placed offstage

**The Painting as a Script**:
- The painting functions as a script that Chaerea reads and agrees to enact
- The inspiration for the rape comes directly from the painting, not Chaerea's performance

**Chaerea's Marriage Proposal**:
- Chaerea's marriage proposal is not a result of his own performance, but Thais' goodwill and his father's permissiveness
- He remains in the degraded position of being subjugated to Thais

**The Eunuch Role**:
- Chaerea is stuck in the eunuch role after the rape, despite wanting to resume his contemptuous attitude towards Thais
- Thais releases him from the role when she decides he has been punished enough
- He responds by immediately becoming her client and eternal protégé

**Symbolic Castration**:
- Chaerea's loss of virility is symbolic, but there is also a more literal reference to his castration


#### Ancient Roman punishment for adultery: a case of Pythias and Parmeno.

**Punishment for Adultery**

**Pythias' Narrative**:
- Describes a boy who was raped by a girl's brother after being delivered to the family as a eunuch substitute
- Pythias indicates that the boy's father was an important figure in the community
- The girl's brother became "violent" and "hot-tempered" when he discovered the rape
- He tied up the boy and threatened him, saying it was punishment for adultery
- Pythias expresses shock and regret at the situation, using euphemisms like "the usual treatment for adulterers"

**Possible Roman Punishments for Adultery**:
- **Depilation**: Removing pubic hair with hot ash
- **Anal Penetration**: With radishes or mullets
- These are not attested as normal Roman practices, but are mentioned in Greek literature and later Roman poems
- Other potential punishments include flogging, castration, and rape by servants

**Phaedromus' Warning about Adultery**:
- Phaedromus advises his friend to be careful with his love affairs
- He warns that if people find out, he may face punishment like being "detestable" (intestabilis) and having his "witness protection" revoked
- This could refer to the threat of castration or other brutal punishments for adultery in Roman society


#### Plautus' Eunuchus: Pythias, castration, role-playing, and metatheater in Roman comedy.

**Eunuchus Play Analysis: Pythias' Speech and Metatheatrical Significance**

**Pythias' Speech:**
- Refers to "id quod moechis solet" (the customary punishment for adulterers) as castration
- No other standard punishments identified
- Consistent with Plautine testimony on comic genre conventions
- Metatheatrical application: points to the punitive norm both on and off the Roman stage
- Pythias is a self-aware character who knows comic genre conventions
- Suggests that Chaerea's imagined punishment complements Thais' scene where she unmanned him

**Castration in Eunuchus:**
- Pythias proposes castration for adulterers, but it is not actually happening to Chaerea at the moment
- Id quod moechis solet: being threatened with castration, not suffering it
- Parmeno forgets his place in a fabula and does not notice that Pythias has not said the castration has happened yet

**Metatheatrical Significance:**
- Connection between the eunuch intrigue and the painting as emblem
- Eunuch role transcends its intended frame and becomes reality
- Repeated emphasis on the theatrical artifice of the eunuch intrigue around a 'real' work of art
- Painting is at the heart of both the play and its metatheatrical significance.

**Mimetic Contagion:**
- Chaerea's performance as the eunuch and the painting have the same aggressive quality, wanting to step outside their intended frames and become reality
- Thais' role in role-playing is also framed in metatheatrical terms, with her swearing that she loves Phaedria alone and needing him to leave for a few days.

**Thraso and Phaedria:**
- Thraso is identified as the soldier rival of Phaedria by Parmeno
- Phaedria responds using a theatrical metaphor, calling it a 'hard role' for his brother
- This theatrical dimension has been noted since Donatus.

**Thais' Soliloquy:**
- Thais expresses concern about her relationship with Phaedria in an intensely metatheatrical soliloquy
- She denies that she has fabricated any falsity or that anyone is dearer to her than Phaedria, but this is not entirely true.


#### Analyzing Roman comedy's meretrix character and its relationship to art and representation in literature.

**Character Analysis: Thais**
* Thais is a character from the Roman comedy "Thais" by Phaedrus
* She plays the stock character of a meretrix (prostitute) in the play
* Initially pretends to be more venal than she really is, hoping to regain Phaedria's affections with expensive gifts
* Fears her deception may become more global than intended
* Recognizes the stock theatricality of her role, despite insisting on an ethical gap between persona and self
* Fascination for audience lies in being both representative and not representative of standard meretrix

**Character Development: Thais**
* Phaedria struggles to distinguish true love from mercenary motives in Thais
* Believes she is a typical mercenary prostitute, playing one man against another for maximal lucre
* Fears her deception will become reality and she will be stuck in the role of meretrix
* By end of play, other characters agree that she really is that mercenary meretrix
* Arrangements made to ensure she remains in this role

**Symbolism: The Painting**
* Similarities between Thais' deception and a painted rape scene
* Deception passes outside intended boundary and becomes reality, like the painting stepping out of its own frame
* Characters become the things they have pretended to be.

#### Scholarship on ancient Roman comedy: Eunuchus play analysis, dramatic language, and theatrical self-consciousness. Castration and eunuch themes, interpretation of specific lines.

**Drama and Dramatic Language in Ancient Plays**

**Dramatic Language and Intrigue**:
- Scholars have noted the convergence of dramatic language and its appropriateness with respect to intrigue
- Frangoulidis (1994a) presents a coordinated argument for theatrical self-consciousness

**The Eunuch Play**:
- No direct evidence that the Eunuch was awarded the **palma** (dramatic prize), but Suetonius' testimony suggests this may have been the case
- The play was the highest remunerated comedy to date, and was performed twice in one day
- The **palm frond** as a dramatic prize can be seen from at least Plautus' time

**Plautus vs. Terence**:
- In both Plautus and Terence, characters express doubts about what the other is wearing
- This echoes the prologue's reference to Chaerea being dressed as a eunuch

**Symbolic Castration**:
- The rape scene in the play may not have been planned, but the painting confirms Chaerea's intention
- The verb **commendare** (to recommend) is used in the context of the rape
- Dessa (1995) sees several characters as sexually ambivalent extensions of the eunuch theme, including Chaerea
- However, the author doubts there is anything positive about this symbolic castration

**Castration as Punishment**:
- In Roman comedy, characters often threaten to **castrate** their wives or lovers if they catch them together
- This may be a joke at the expense of the soldier character, who threatens to kill his wife and lover
- The word **indigna** (unsuitable) in the play has been interpreted as "foul and cruel", but it could also mean "unsuitable" for an adolescent

**The Eunuch Play's Title**:
- The play is called **Eunuchus**, which could refer to the real eunuch, Dorus, or the character who is pretending to be a eunuch
- The origin of the play's name is unclear, with different interpretations among scholars


## 5. Mimic Rape: Genre Switching and Role Confusion

**Plautus' Influences and Role Confusion**

**Fraenkel's Contributions**:
- Most influential Plautus study in 20th century
- Focused on relationship between Roman plays and Greek originals
- Distinguished by focus on Plautine elements, not just Greek reconstructions
- Lasting contributions: brilliant readings and insights about individual plays

**Influence of Italian Folk Theatre**:
- Fraenkel suggested influence from pre-literary Italian theatre
- Broad notion of unscripted improvisational entertainment
- Recent research explores this connection in Plautus' plays

**Plautus' Departures from Greek Comedy**:
- Fraenkel accounted for Plautus' departures using Italian folk theatre
- This influence is less apparent in Terence's work due to closer adherence to Greek models

**The Rape Scene in the Eunuch (Eun.)**:
- Researchers argue it evokes a scene from mime, not for visual entertainment
- Serves to comment on the generic boundary of Terence's art.


### Comedy’s Other

**Plautus' Debt to Native Italian Theatre**
- Scholarship on Plautus' debt to native Italian theatre often draws from evidence of: Fescennine, satura, Atellan farce, Phlyax, and mime
- Assumption is these theatrical types were regional variations of a single genre
- Evidence demonstrates these theatrical forms were varied, not monolithic or undeviating cultural backdrop for Roman comedy

**Similarities and Influence Between Theatres**
- Undeniable similarities between these theatrical types: rough, bawdy, improvisational, humor based on ridicule
- Not necessarily stable genres, open to each other's influence, especially in southern Italy

**Livy's Account of Early Italian Theatre**
- Roman youth began imitating Etruscan dumb shows, incorporating witty verses and movements (7.2.5–7)
- Etruscan word for player was *ister*, so name *histriones* given to native artists
- Saturas evolved from crude, random performances to scripted plays with plots (7.2.8)
- Livius Andronicus introduced Greek tragedy and comedy in Latin translation around 240 BCE

**Impact on Roman Poetic Genres**
- Saturas absorbed social and performative functions of Fescennine verses, rendering them obsolete
- Fabulae (highbrow theatre) replaced saturae as theatrical standard
- Livius Andronicus' invention of fabulae led to withdrawal of Roman youth from staged performances and revival of aristocratic song

**Atellan Farce and Exodia**
- Atellan farces derived from Oscan tradition, kept by youth and not allowed to be polluted by professional actors (7.2.11–12)
- Fluidity in these traditions: diverse forms framed as successive vessels of Roman poetic performance

**Mime's Early History and Flexibility**
- Difficult to determine mime's exact place among Italian theatrical forms due to obscurity of early history and its flexibility.


### Un-Terence in the Prologues

**Terence's Un-Terence: The Prologues**

**Distinction between Terence and Roman Comic Poets**:
- Terence is more staid than other Roman comic poets
- This judgment is not based on disinterested literary history, but on poetic self-presentation

**Prologue of Heautontimorumenos**:
- Ambivius Turpio distinguishes Terence's sedate play from a recent play by Luscius Lanuvinus
- Refers to the latter as featuring a **servus currens scene**, and asks the audience to pay attention and keep quiet
- Mentions that he is an old man, and if this play fails he will have to return to playing roles like **running slaves, angry old men, hungry parasites, brazen tricksters, and greedy pimps**
- Evokes a type of theatre different from his own, but does not refer to it as "mime"

**Mime in Roman Theatrical Genres**:
- Mime's place within the dichotomous economy of Roman theatrical genres was such that anything identifiably other than New Comedy could be antithetically characterized as "mime" or "mimic"
- Examples:
  - Aulus Gellius criticizing Caecilius for replacing the subtlety of Menander with "alien farcical buffoonery"
  - Caecilius' play described as having "mimic elements" that are "alien to Menander"

**Terence's Aesthetic Difference**:
- Terence is generally spare in his inclusion of **servus currens scenes and related stock physical elements**
- He has injected these elements into the prologue of Heautontimorumenos, but only in narrative form (pura oratio)
- This is contrasted with the "other theatrical world" that the actors have been involved in

**Fragility of Terence's Productions**:
- The prologues consistently draw attention to the possibility of disruptive events (e.g., tightrope walker, gladiators) disrupting the performance
- This may be seen as a kind of humor, drawing on the same sense of humour as Gallus' outrageous production in 167 bce

**Concluding Thoughts**:
- Scholars have debated the historical accuracy of Terence's prologues, with some (e.g., Gruen) arguing they are more likely to be playful and ironic than factual


### Imitatio Vitae and Vitalis

**Mime: Imitation in Ancient Theatre**

**Defining Mime (Diomedes' Definition)**
- Mime is an imitation of speech and irreverent movement or words with wantonness
- Derived from the Greek word 'mimēsis', meaning representation or mimicry
- Distinctive name: "mime" is an imitation of life, both licit and illicit
- Universal subject matter, but focuses on low registers in Latin

**Characteristics of Mime**
- Representation of a wide range of registers from high to low
- Prodigious capacity for imitation (vultus et vocis imitatio)
- Improvisational freedom allows responsiveness to audience

**Vitalis Epitaph (Latin Anthology)**
- Mime Vitalis replicated spectators onstage and in their own eyes
- Audience realized they had been absorbed into his body, leading to cold rigidity and silence
- Death of Vitalis an imitative response to audience's response, creating a foretaste of their death with him.

**Mimetic Contagion in Ancient Mime**
- Mimesis can result in the reversal of 'flow' or imitation (discussed in Chapters 2–4)
- Few evidence on audience response to mime, but Vitalis epitaph suggests sympathetic audience imitation.


### Contagious Mime in Xenophon’s Symposium

**Socrates' Discourse on Learning Virtue from Xenophon's Symposium**

**Entertainment at Callias' Party:**
- Syracusan entertainer performs with mime troupe
- Musical piece delights symposiasts

- Wants to learn figures (virtues) from the mime troupe
- Defends virtue's teachability, associating with virtuous people

**Imitation of Mimes: Philosophical Significance:**
- Learning imitation as a form of training in virtue
- Socrates suggests using dance for symposium celebration
- Impresario agrees and leaves with troupe

**Socrates' Erotikos Logos:**
- Praises Callias' chaste, spiritual affection for Autolycus
- Distinction between heavenly and vulgar love
- Wine's influence on speech and behavior

**Conclusion:**
- Socrates emphasizes importance of learning virtues through association and imitation.


#### Theatrical performance blurs reality and representation in Xenophon's Symposium excerpt.

**Socrates' Speech and the Mime Performance**

**Socrates' Speech**:
- Describes a scenario where Dionysus will be arriving at a symposium, having just come from a drunken gathering with the gods
- Explains that this mime will portray Dionysus' arrival and his interaction with Ariadne in a way that mirrors the symposiasts' own experiences of wine and love
- Suggests that the symposiasts have been drinking in the presence of divinity

**The Mime Performance**:
- Features characters of Dionysus and Ariadne, who will mirror the superficial condition (drunkenness) and deeper story of the audience
- The performance is described in detail, highlighting:
  - **Ariadne's reaction to hearing music**, indicating her delight at Dionysus' arrival
  - **Dionysus' interaction with Ariadne**, including them embracing and kissing in front of the audience
  - The spectators' reactions, including clapping for an "encore" and swearing they will get married
- Xenophon's description explores the slippage between reality (the actors) and representation (the audience's experience)


### Chaerea Stupidus

**Mime's Imitative Faculty:**
* Directed outwards to audience in Vitalis epitaph and Xenophon's Symposium
* Simulated in Plautine comedy through competitive matching between characters
	+ Par pari respondere: tight verbal echoes intensify unscripted responsorial contest
* Consolidated on one character, the mimus secundus (mime's fool)
	+ Follows and apes superior, creating derivative performances
	+ Examples: Sannio to Harlequin in Commedia dell'arte, Papageno in Die Zauberflöte
* Character of second mime is lovable and enduring, often more interesting than the archimimus (principal role)

**The Eunuch:**
* Duplex comedia: dominant love story between Phaedria and Thais
* Chaerea's love affair is an auxiliary double of his brother's
* Parmeno's script followed closely by Chaerea until intervention of painting
* Ethical consistency in Chaerea's mimetic conformity
* Direct mimicry of painting as archimimus role
* Connection to second-century Italian folk theatre: Santia vase (Phlyax vase)
	+ Unexceptional form, typical secondary decoration
	+ Figure standing next to small statue of Herakles
	+ Comic slave mask with different chlamys and chiton
	+ Lacks phallus above head in retrograde Oscan lettering: SANTIA.


### Mime and Body

**Ancient Mime: A Spectrum of Dramatic Expression**

**Background**
- Located between declamation and mute action
- Preponderance of non-verbal entertainment
- Overlapping themes with New Comedy and Greek romance

**Characteristics**
- Obscenity: explicit sexual situations, bawdy language
- Physicality: dance, physical comedy, acrobats, jugglers
- Sexualized female bodies: actresses playing female roles

**Historical Development**
- Gradual lengthening of male costumes (jerkin), shortening of phallus
- Females often sexualized in other ways
  - Gender parity between performers and roles
  - Nude mimae: bed onstage, sex consummated before audience
- Formlessness frustrates clear history of genre development

**Historical Context**
- Performed at Floralia festival (28 April–10 May)
- Ludi Megalenses (4–10 April) in 161 bce included mime performance with naked mimae or meretrices as mimae.


### Code Switch: Mime

**Mime Elements in Terence's Eunuch**

**Violent Physicality and Extreme Sexuality**:
- Rape scene reminiscent of mime
- Contains violent physicality, extreme sexuality, and female nudity
- Not fitting in the restrained world of New Comedy
- Framed as an imitation or work of art

**Generic Rupture in Terence's Play**:
- Donatus states that the narration of backstage events was a soliloquy in Greek original
- Terence introduced the character Antipho to break it up
- Antipoho's name means 'protatic character' and his remarks are mainly phatic
- Only one real interruption of substance: wanting to see Chaerea's shameless face and stance

**Antipoho's Interruption**:
- Refers to Chaerea's erection as a 'huge ass'
- Erections are indicative of mime, not palliata (New Comedy)
- Masks were used in New Comedy but not in mime
- Antipoho's reference to Chaerea's face signals the use of different masks for genres


### Ekphrastic Role Confusion

**Ekphrastic Role Confusion (Mime and Comic Actor)**

**Performance Styles**:
- Mime: Delirious lack of focus
- Comic Actor: Converses

**Description of Painting in Eunuch**:
- Chaerea's description is unclear
- Hallucinatory confusion between Jupiter transforming into rain or man
- Mythological narrative substituted for description (aiunt)

**Versions of the Myth**:
- Jupiter sends gold shower to Danaë
- Jupiter enters Danaë's chamber as shower, then assumes human form

**Possible Solutions from Donatus**:
1. Discrete moments in myth depicted
2. Jupiter sending rain and transforming into man
3. Ethical transformation of Jupiter, not physical

**Iconographic Depictions of the Myth**:
- Pompeian paintings show Jupiter in human form with gold shower
- Some paintings depict Jupiter as young man next to Danaë
- Difficulty indicating Danaë's identity without golden shower

**Catachresis in Hellenistic Painting**:
- Showing two contradictory versions of the myth in the same frame
- Essential identity of Jupiter/homo and Jupiter/imber

**Recognition by Audience**:
- Chaerea's description may be recognized as accurate rendering of catachrestic type
- Understanding of Jupiter's role as scopophilic spectator and metamorphic sexual actor

**Focal Agency in Painting**:
- Pamphila's attention directed at object invading her body, changing her life
- Mime's imitative faculty can be pointed within or without fictional world.


#### Mime in Ancient Literature: Flexibility, Improvisation, and Performance Styles.

**Mime and Performance in Plautine Comedy**

**Mime's Role in Plautine Comedy:**
- Mime instills extreme flexibility of role for performers
- Roles are labile and plastic, changing with audience or troupe leader
- Performers must remake themselves with hypermobile immediacy
- Two examples: Chaerea and Pamphila, Eunuch character (explored in Chapter 6)

**Background:**
- Preference for improvisational performance in ancient Italian theatre
- Livy's account of Livius Andronicus' introduction of fabula as a turning point
- Division of labour between actor/speaker and singer led to lines being set

**Mime's History:**
- Early mime actors: autokabdaloi (improvisational) and mimographoi (scripted)
- Professionalization of mime was likely political, aristocratic privilege enforced amateurism

**Characteristics of Mime:**
- Improvisational in nature
- Burlesque and literary realism
- Four main characters: Pappus, Maccus, Bucco, Dossennus (or Manducus)
- Phlyax as 'Italian mime'

**Mime's Impact on Roman Comedy:**
- Plautus and Terence represented different theatrical aesthetics
- Cicero's high praise of Terence does not contradict emphasis on restraint and niceness
- Caesar's epigram focuses on Terence's mild verse, wishing for greater energy.


#### Ancient Roman theater analysis: Terence's Hecyra and audience disturbances

**Ancient Roman Theater: Comedies and Entertainment**

**Terence's Criticism of His Own Performance (Caesar's Comment)**
- Caesar criticizes Terence for lacking comic vigor equal to the Greeks
- Caesar wishes Terence could display straightforward and unaffected acting like a 'statarius' actor
  - Contrasted with more agitated performances
- The term 'statarius' refers to an actor in less taxing, unaffected roles

**Types of Comedies**
- motoriae: turbulent and flashy
- statariae: quieter and straightforward
- mixtae: a combination of both

**Anicius' Entertainment and Chaos at the Circus**
- Anicius brings Greek musicians to Rome for spectacle in Circus
  - Demanded they show more competitive spirit, leading to chaos and melee on stage
- Boxers, buglers join in, suggesting event was planned and controlled by Anicius

**Historical Context**
- Polybius' description is incredulous but does not offer explanation for the incident
- Scholars disagree about interpretation: some see it as a spontaneous departure from the musical program, others believe it was well-planned and under Anicius' control.

**Terence's Plays and Didascaliae**
- The Hecyra is unique in Terence’s plays with two preserved didascaliae (annotations on manuscripts) reporting different accounts of its performance history.
  - Codex Bembinus mentions no problems during the second performance but says the first was without a prologue; other manuscripts (Σ) indicate the first performance fell through completely and the second had no issues.
- Both versions agree on three performances, with varying details about their success or failure.

**Comparison to Aristophanes' Frogs**
- In Aristophanes' Frogs, Xanthias wants to tell old jokes that always get a laugh but draws line at truly tired quips by Ameipsias, Lycis, and Phrynichus
- The humor lies in the partial inclusion of these jokes through ironic praeteritio (rejecting what is worn out)
- This situation is different from Terence's challenges with offstage physical entertainment that is totally different in kind and impossible to incorporate into his plays.


#### An analysis of ancient Greek literature: mimesis, Xenophon's Symposium, and Plato's influence.

**Greek Definition of Mimesis**
- Theophrastus as possible source: no proof (Giancotti 1967)
- Meaning of mimesis complex, Plato and beyond (Halliwell 2002)

**Epitaph for Vitalis**
- Crederes emended to crederer by Shackleton Bailey (1982)
- Multiple interpretations: death, spectator, reader, Vitalis
- Framed addresses to death and Vitalis throughout

**Socrates' Influence on Callias and Autolycus**
- Quoted in Memorabilia by Xenophon (1.2.20)
- Association with Socrates as training in virtue
- Physical dimension to relationship between Callias and Autolycus? (Hindley 1999)

**Logical Problem of Dionysus' Inclusion in the Oath**
- Various scholars propose lacuna or emendations
- Huss: text is not logically inconsistent but intentionally blurs reality and mimesis

**Xenophon's Symposium vs Plato's Symposium**
- Scholarship focuses on comparing and dating the texts
- Danzig (2005) argues Xenophon wrote chapters 8 and 9 as response to Plato
- Unity in Xenophon's ending, despite apparent lack of resolution (Danzig 2005)

**Par pari respondere in Roman Comedy**
- Asymmetrical development of love stories
- Double plot structure in Andria: rudimentary but significant

**Characterization and Costume in Terentian Comedy**
- Hybridity of character types and costume conventions at the margins of Greek culture.


#### Ancient Greek and Roman mime: analysis of performances, genres, and connections to literature.

**Relationship between Xanthias Pots and Mythological References:**
- Comparison between Santia and Dionysus in Aristophanes' Frogs (1932)
- Transformation of Zeus into gold and his visit to a girl: Menander's Dyscolus, Aulularia, Casina, Cistellaria, Rudens, Samia
- Possible sources for these stories: Middle Comedy or Italian traditions (Chiarini 1980)

**Mime:**
- Centrality of slapstick and sexual violence in mime
- Differences between dramatic and non-dramatic mime (W. J. Slater 2002)
- Comparison to Latin novel genre or Pseudo-Lucianic Ass, Iolaus
- Use of phallus and subligaculum by actors

**Cross-Dressing in Ancient Theatre:**
- Discussion on normativity and semiotic insignificance (Henderson 1996)
- Examples from Greek tragedy and comedy: Bacchae, Thesmophoriazusae, Casina

**Characteristics of Mime:**
- Performances not even slaves should look at (Plutarch)
- Flexible setting, including interior spaces
- Use of fan in Chaerea's pseudo-martial use by a young man: 9.38, 595
- Comparison to shield play by young soldiers in Livy's account of Heracleum capture (44.9)

**Mime Performers:**
- Variety of performers including jugglers called mimi or based on object they juggle: ventilator, toy shield juggler (Slater 2002)
- Use of fan by Chaerea as a shield to hide erection in Terence's Eunuch.


## 6. The Poetics of Contamination

**Contamination in Roman Comedy**

**Etymology of Contamination**:
- The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines "contamination" as:
    - Pollution or corruption (1.a, b)
    - Philological term for blending of stories (c), lexical forms (d), or manuscripts (e)
    - These technical meanings are related and ethically neutral
- The OED entry does not mention that the technical usage is an importation from German "Kontamination"
- Scholars assumed they were recovering the original meaning of Latin "contaminare"

**Contamination in Terence's Plays**:
- **Andria (16)**: Terence admits lifting material from other plays, which his enemies criticize as "contaminating"
    - He defends this by saying it is better to imitate the "neglegentia" of earlier poets than their "obscure diligence"
- **Heautontimorumenos (17)**: Terence acknowledges contaminating Greek plays for Latin ones, which his enemies criticize
    - He justifies this by saying he is following the example of other poets

**Contamination as "Mixing"**:
- The term "contamination" originally meant "mixing", not necessarily negative
- The philological term rests on this ethically neutral sense, but can imply "hasty or clumsy workmanship"
- Terence's enemies may have used the word in a more pejorative sense, and Terence responds ironically

**Contamination in Roman Comedy Research**:
- The study of contamination in Roman comedy emerged as a new sub-discipline, "Kontaminationsforschung"
    - This approach was based on the Homeric Higher Criticism, which had been the foundational principle of classical philology
    - It aimed to separate the original Greek material from Plautus' "amalgamations" of multiple Greek models


### Scholarly debate on Plautine contamination in Roman literature: defining spoilage and mixture.

**Plautus and Terence's Scholarly Project: Differences from Source Criticism**
- Plautus and Terence are not just drawing on various literary sources for an original product, but also bastardizing translations of one play with scenes from another.
- In ancient Roman culture, **purity** is considered a self-evident virtue, leading to the assumption that drama must supply the **Gesamtkunstwerk**.
- Menander's plays are seen as sensitive and fine-drawn, bringing together the best of tragedy and comedy, tradition and novelty.
- Germans have written poems about how Menander must have been the original genius of his age.

**Problems with Approach to Classical Texts**
- **Methodological**: Study of Plautine contaminatio rests on brittle ground due to:
  - Terence potentially lying about Plautus combining plays
  - Lack of evidence for Plautus actually combining models in any single play
- **Ideological**: Assumption that Latin comedy is always the "contaminated" version, rather than the Greek original.

**Reevaluation of Contaminatio**
- **Contaminare** may mean "spoil" or "ruin", rather than just mixing.
- The "contamination triangle" consists of:
  1. Principal Greek model (e.g., Menander's Andria)
  2. Secondary Greek model (e.g., Menander's Perinthia)
  3. Latin text produced by combination (Terence's Andria)
- Contaminate may mean "spoiling" one of these texts, rather than mixing them.

**Definitions and Consequences**
- Duckworth's definition: Greek play is "defiled" if alien matter is added, but Latin comedy is not contaminated.
  - This exclusion is a consequence of rejecting mixture from the definition of contaminare.
- Goldberg's refinement: Excerpted text is spoiled for translation by any future Latin poet, but principal model is not corrupted at all.

**Conclusion**: The study of Plautine contaminatio remains a complex issue with ongoing scholarly debate on the meaning and implications of **contaminare**.


### Disputing the meaning of "contaminatio" in Roman literature: mixture or defacement?

**Terence's Contaminatio:**

**Background:**
- Terence accused of mixing Greek plays in his adaptations
- Criticism not based on artistic concerns but copyright issues

**Examples of Contaminatio:**
1. Eunuch: mixing in a scene from Synapothnescontes by Diphilus (Ad 9–11)
2. Andria and Perinthia: similar plots, different diction and style (Andr. 13-20)
3. Phasma and Thesauro: Luscius Lanuvinus' poor Latin translations (Eun. 7–10)
4. Origen's criticism of Jerome for merging works (Jerome, De viris illustribus)
5. Cicero's Pro Sulla 45: truth contaminated with deception? (Per me ego veritatem patefactam contaminarem aliquo mendacio?)
6. Accius' Atreus fragment: mixing of blood and families (Quod re in summa summum esse arbitror, matres coinquinari regias, contaminari stirpem ac misceri genus)
7. Livy 4.1.1: patricians object to mixing of social classes through marriage (qua contaminari sanguinem suum patres confundique iura gentium rebantur)

**Discussion:**
- Beare's focus on copyright vs aesthetic concerns in Terence's work
- Goldberg's argument for the definition of contaminatio as 'miscendo depravare' or 'male miscere'
- Cicero's use of contaminare with moral neutrality regarding mixing (qua contaminari sanguinem suum patres confundique iura gentium rebantur) and mixture being at fault (De domo 35: non aetas eius qui adoptabat est quaesita, ut in Cn.)
- Contextual understanding of the meaning of contaminatio as it relates to Terence's work.


### Contaminated Eunuch

**Contaminated Eunuch**

**Eunuch's Hybridity**:
- Terence's restricted understanding of contamination has led us to miss the Eunuch's playful awareness of its own hybridity
- We have examined two attestations of contaminare in the prologues, but Terence uses the word one other time

**Chaerea's Exclamation**:
- Chaerea emerges from the house where he has just raped Pamphila, believing he is alone
- He exclaims "numquis hinc me sequitur?", meaning "is anyone following me?"
- He expresses relief that no one is following him, but also longing for a companion
- Antipho arrives and asks Chaerea what is going on

**Contamination in Terence's Work**:
- Scholars have disagreed on whether Chaerea's exclamation indicates relief or longing
- Donatus suggests that Chaerea's wishes are complex and not fully fixed
- The infinitive "audias" does not indicate whether Chaerea is relieved or disappointed at being alone
- Terence had previously used the same sentence in his play Andria, which was criticized for contaminating Menander's text

**The Andria Connection**:
- Terence mixed a scene from Menander's Eunouchos into his Andria play
- This scene featured a character named Pamphilus who also believed he was alone and expressed joy
- Terence took this scene and gave it to a different character (Davus) in the Eunuch, overheard by Charinus
- This "inconcinnity" disconcerted critics, as it mixed elements from two different plays

**The Contaminated Scenes**:
- The scenes featuring the soldier and parasite have a different feel than other scenes in the Eunuch
- These characters are strangers to the text and the ethos of the play
- They are not Athenians or resident aliens, and are lodging in neither of the onstage houses


#### Gnatho's monologue: Imitating successful men to gain favor and power.

**Gnatho's Monologue (Act 2) in Terence's Play**

**Background:**
- Gnatho meets a man of his rank and station who is destitute
- The man laments his lost inheritance and friends who have abandoned him
- Gnatho expresses contempt for the man, seeing him as inferior

**Gnatho's Advice to the Destitute Man:**
- He advises the man to learn from him, becoming a pupil
- This is a reference to ancient philosophical schools and their masters
- The man wants to emulate Gnatho after witnessing his reception by vendors

**Implications:**
- Gnatho's success at toadying puts him in a position where others want to fawn on him
- His disciple's imitation of him is studied, while the imitation from others is unconscious
- The world is drawn into his ethical paradigm through spectating (videt) the triumph of bad behavior over good.

**Historical Context:**
- Relevance to ancient sumptuary laws in Rome
  - Lex Fannia of 161 bce banned excessive spending during Ludi Megalenses banquets
  - Protected Roman youth from prodigality and education by banned philosophers/rhetoricians.

**Key Terms:**
- Gnatho: A character who teaches others to be like him through imitation
- Discipleship: The process of learning from a master or teacher
- Spectating (videt): Witnessing an event that influences behavior.


#### Analyzing interpolated characters in Terence's comedy "The Eunuch" and their impact on plot resolution.

**Terence's Interpolated Scenes in Menander's Eunuch**

**Character of Gnatho**:
- Described as a "spreading infection" by Donatus
- Appears in four scenes with the soldier character
- Interactions are superfluous to the main plot
- Could have been accomplished by other means

**Interaction between Characters**:
- Thraso leads an assault on Thais' house, but it is oddly inserted and comes to nothing
- Critics have complained about this "prosthetic" feeling

**Removal of Interpolated Scenes**:
- Scholars attempted to remove these scenes, but the last scene cannot be extricated from the play's denouement
- Walther Ludwig believes the final scene is Terence's own invention

**Theatrical Double Entendres**:
- Phaedria and Parmeno use theatrical references when discussing Thraso's return
- Suggests that the audience is aware of the interpolated characters being on stage

**Gnatho's Proposal to Phaedria**:
- Gnatho suggests keeping Thraso as a rival and fleecing him for expenses
- Phaedria is incensed, but eventually agrees due to the need for Thraso in the plot

**Gnatho's Request to Join the Company**:
- Gnatho requests to be admitted into the group of characters
- Repetition of the word "receptus" suggests an acting troupe

**Thraso's Popularity**:
- Thraso believes he is always loved by everyone, but this is a boastful claim
- The parasite and Thraso become structurally necessary to the play's ending

**Conclusion**:
- The interpolated characters are eventually welcomed into Thais' house, closing the play.


#### An analysis of Terence's 'Eunuch' play, contamination in Roman comedy and scholarship.

**The Eunuch Play by Terence:** Contamination and Moral Infection

**Thais, the Prostitute**:
- One of the best-liked prostitutes in Roman comedy
- Perceived as principled, loyal, humane, and strong
- Contrasts with weak-willed, egotistical men in the play

**The Ending of the Play**:
- Final arrangement between Thraso and Phaedria has offended critics
- Seems unjustly demeaning to Thais, a "rara avis" (rare bird)
- Also degrades Phaedria, who was previously depicted as helplessly in love

**Moral Infection in the Play**:
- Radical discontinuity of character in the play
- Ethically denatures everyone else to integrate the interpolated characters
- Disturbing for modern readers, casting a shadow over the happy ending

**Contamination and Scholarship on the Eunuch Play**:
- Early 20th century scholars attempted to "decontaminate" the play
- Their work disregarded as bad methodology, aesthetics, and politics
- But their attempt may have been an extension of their own implication in the text
- The text itself suggests we think about the Greek originals that lie behind it
- Average Roman viewer likely unaware of Menander's original play

**Contamination and Contaminare**:
- **Contaminatio** not attested before 3rd century CE
- Meaning of **contaminare** debated, but generally related to "misceating" or "spoiling"
- Scholars provided various translations, such as "zusammanpatzen", "rem corrumpere aliquid admiscendo", and "spoil by combining"
- Terence did not defend the legitimacy of his procedure, but acknowledged the criticism

**Implications**:
- The Eunuch play may be a form of black comedy, with moral infection and denaturing characters
- The audience in 161 BCE may have been aware of the Greek originals to some extent


## Epilogue

**The Story of the Abderites**

**Background:**
- Anecdote from Lucian's "How to Write History" about an incident in Abdera during the Parthian War
- Comparison to epidemic of historiography and tragic fever that affected the population

**Impact on Abderites**:
- Infection with tragedy after watching Euripides' "Andromeda" performance
- Extreme response: constant squawking, bellowing, and recitation of play lines
- Lasted until winter, causing a significant disruption to daily life

**Significance for Our Purposes**:
- Relevance to the themes of "How to Write History": critique of rhetorical enthusiasm
- Narrow focus on the imitative response of Abderites towards art and performance

**Analysis**:
- Imitative response not a matter of rational persuasion but a sympathetic fever
- Comparison with Plato's analogy for poetic inspiration in "Ion" (magnetism)
- Andromeda as a communicable disease assimilating the audience

**Fragments of Euripides' "Andromeda"**:
- One line quoted by Lucian: σὺ δ᾽ ὦ θεῶν τύραννε κἀνθρώπων Ἔρως
- Scholars assume it is intended for its pathos and popularity
- Exception by Peter von Möllendorff: fragments suggest a "coded cry for help" from the Abderites

**Conclusion**:
- The Andromeda's effect on the audience was not only emotional but also contagious, leading to an extreme imitative response.
