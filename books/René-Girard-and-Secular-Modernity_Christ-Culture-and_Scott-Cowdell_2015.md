# René Girard And Secular Modernity Christ Culture And Scott Cowdell 2015

> In René Girard and Secular Modernity: Christ, Culture, and Crisis, Scott Cowdell provides the first systematic interpretation of René Girard’s controversial approach to secular modernity. Cowdell identifies the scope, development, and implications of Girard’s thought, the centrality of Christ in Girard's thinking, and, in particular, Girard's distinctive take on the uniqueness and finality of Christ in terms of his impact on Western culture. In Girard’s singular vision, according to Cowdell, secular modernity has emerged thanks to the Bible’s exposure of the cathartic violence that is at the root of religious prohibitions, myths, and rituals. In the literature, the psychology, and most recently the military history of modernity, Girard discerns a consistent slide into an apocalypse that challenges modern ideas of romanticism, individualism, and progressivism.
> 
> In the first three chapters, Cowdell examines the three elements of Girard’s basic intellectual vision (mimesis, sacrifice, biblical hermeneutics) and brings this vision to a constructive interpretation of “secularization” and “modernity,” as these terms are understood in the broadest sense today. Chapter 4 focuses on modern institutions, chiefly the nation state and the market, that function to restrain the outbreak of violence. And finally, Cowdell discusses the apocalyptic dimension of Girard's theory in relation to modern warfare and terrorism. Here, Cowdell engages with the most recent writings of Girard (particularly his Battling to the End) and applies them to further conversations in cultural theology, political science, and philosophy. Cowdell takes up and extends Girard’s own warning concerning an alternative to a future apocalypse: “What sort of conversion must humans undergo, before it is too late?” - [René Girard and Secular Modernity_Christ Culture and_Scott Cowdell_2015](https://www.amazon.com/Ren%C3%A9-Girard-Secular-Modernity-Culture/dp/0268023743?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

### Preface

**My Journey to René Girard's Work**
- **Late discovery**: came to Girard's work late in my academic career
- **Three false starts**:
  - In the early 1990s, influenced by Walter Wink on New Testament "powers and principalities" but did not appreciate Girard's influence
  - Late 1990s, asked to review Why Must There Be Scapegoats? by Raymund Schwager (Girardian Jesuit theologian) but could not understand it
  - Attended gathering of Australian Anglican theologians where Girard's work was introduced, but failed to connect
- **Awakening**: invited to review James Alison's book On Being Liked in 2004
- **Hooked**: realized Girard provided an intellectual vision with great simplicity and power, as well as spiritual and psychological insight
- **Girardian synthesis**: advanced some way toward this in a 2009 book, Abiding Faith: Christianity Beyond Certainty, Anxiety, and Violence
- **Needed to learn more about Girard**: began working on this volume to undertake a Girardian account of secular modernity

**Acknowledgments**
- **Research Fellowship**: grateful for the opportunity at Charles Sturt University to do this type of work uninterrupted
- **Collegeville Institute**: spent 4 months in sabbatical leave for research phase, enjoyed life together with fellow scholars and monastic community
- **French language**: started from scratch, learned French through night classes and intensive course, grateful to teachers, hosts, and mentors

**Preparation and Publication**
- **Commissioning editor**: special thanks to Charles Van Hof at the University of Notre Dame Press for commissioning this volume and seeing it on its way
- **Editorial support**: Wendy McMillen and Sheila Berg for editing and design, Jeffrey Smart for allowing use of his painting, and other contributors who read the manuscript and provided suggestions
- **Girardian expertise and editorial eye**: Bruce Wilson offered valuable comments on draft chapters, gracious endorsement, and "Girardian therapy" during a difficult parish appointment
- **Posthumous dedication**: dedicated to Joan Meyers, my (adoptive) mother's sister and next-door neighbor who cared for her aged mother. She made him her project and their debt is deep though not clearly expressed before it was too late.

- Published numerous works on Shakespeare as a sophisticated analyst of mimetic desire.


#### Exploring Girard's theories on mimetic desire, violence, and secular modernity in literature and philosophy.

**René Girard's Work on Mimeticism and Scapegoating Culture**

**Girard's Contributions:**
- Presented Shakespeare as a psychological genius and Christian prophet in works like A Midsummer Night's Dream, Julius Caesar, and The Winter's Tale.
- Explored mimeticism and the nature of scapegoating culture in Job: The Victim of His People (1985) and Oedipus Unbound (2004), comparing it to Soviet-style show trials.
- Engaged with Indian Vedic literature, finding limited awareness of the scapegoat mechanism; published a lecture series on the Vedas titled Sacrifice (2003).
- Founded Colloquium on Violence and Religion in 1990 for exploring, critiquing, and developing his work.

**Impact:**
- His ideas inspired many in various fields including literature, philosophy, anthropology, and theology.
- His work has been translated into multiple languages and continues to be studied worldwide.

**Secular Modernity**:
- Contested meanings of secular and modernity.
- Secularization theory explaining desacralizing drive towards atheistic modernity must now account for international variations, postcolonial hybridity, and reversals like militant Islam.

**Presecular Times**:
- Societies were more integral and holistic before late Middle Ages in the West.
- Religion and society interwoven; transcendent God underpinned rationally ordered cosmos and human world.
- Church and state, pope and emperor, archbishop and king structurally interdependent.

**Breakdown of Unified Synthesis**:
- Shift in Western thinking about God under nominalist philosophy made God sovereign over transcendent presence everywhere within the order of things.
- Recovery of Greek learning and shift from monasteries to universities furthered bifurcation of sacred and secular.
- Emergence of modern notion of individual from feudal hierarchy and prosperous middle class.


#### Secularization and Religion's Social Role in Modern Society: Girard's Perspective

**Lay Devotion and Secular Modernity**

**Lay Devotion**:
- Developed under the influence of manuals, lay spiritual communities, and new orders of preaching friars
- Emphasis on individual belief and practice

**Reformation**:
- Inherited the nominalist vision of God and the world from lay devotion
- Doctrinally distinctive denominations jostled for position with "the universal Church"
- Newfound emphasis on lay devotion was quickly diverted into the cultivation of markets and commerce

**Modernity**:
- Public world increasingly understood as the work of voluntary human association, preserved by human know-how, for the pursuit of human well-being
- Less room for God and less need for religion
- Key aspects: reform and diversification, with the one world of Christendom splitting its functions

**Religion in Modernity**:
- Became a separate undertaking, with values remaining in the public square while doctrine and practice retreated behind a veil of privacy
- Allowed for the annexation of nation-states and markets into the modern world

**Secularization Theory**:
- Church attendance plummeting but church taxes still widely paid in Europe
- Churches conceived as public utilities to which one might occasionally need recourse
- In America, churches modeled closer to a business competing for customers in the open market

**Girard's Approach to Secular Modernity**:
1. Religion is not about finding or making personal meaning, but a specific public function having to do with managing violence for the preservation of society
2. Religion as an evolved concomitant of human culture vs. religion (Judaism and Christianity) as a form of countercultural witness
3. The Christian gospel outing and undoing the violent false sacred that undergirds human religiousness, generating unease for its countercultural unwillingness to maintain anybody's status quo
4. The archaic human religious impulse attempting to reconstitute this protective sacred, which while mortally wounded by the gospel was not killed outright
5. The Christian alternative to typical human religiousness, even if regularly compromised throughout history


#### Exploring Girard's perspectives on God, individuality, secularization, and modernity.

**Girard's Perspective on Secular Modernity**

**Key Insights**:
- Girard provides a deeper account of imaginative and social transformation leading to secular modernity beyond the standard narrative
- The separation of God from the social matrix and the rise of the sovereign individual human was first seen in biblical development, as the victim mechanism began its undoing by the real God
- Secularization accords with Charles Taylor's account but has one important reservation regarding the human person

**Girard vs. Taylor on Human Person**:
- Taylor describes secular modern selves as less "porous" and more "buffered" compared to premodern societies
- Girard disagrees that modern people are less mimetic, but rather more so in their independent, self-determining individualism

**Secular Modernity as a Resacralizing Process**:
- Girard identifies a new "religious" face of society in secular modernity, challenging the idea that declining religious engagement exhausts its function
- Secular modernity is functionally religious, but its "religious" dimension does not work as well in restraining violence as archaic religious forms

**Secular Modernity's Roots in Christianity**:
- Girard agrees with Hans Blumenberg, Max Weber, and Marcel Gauchet that secular modernity originated from Christianity
- But differs from their specific theories on how this occurred, focusing instead on the defeat of a violent cultural habitus and the gospel's undoing of the religio-cultural bubble

**Disenchantment and Enchantment in Secular Modernity**:
- Girard sees disenchantment as a necessary consequence of Christian maturity and closeness to God, rather than something to be lamented
- However, new forms of enchantment emerge in secular modern times through investments in historical enmities, nation-states, political ideologies, and market forces

**Girard's Political Position**:
- A conservative in his pragmatic view of society's need for law, order, and religiously motivated disciplines
- But a progressive in his hermeneutic of suspicion towards today's sacred cows like the state, global market, ideology, and militarism
- Holds a moderate position, disavowing any political or ideological program of human perfectibility


### CHAPTER 1: Mimesis, Modernity, and Madness

**Mimesis, Modernity, and Madness**

**Overview of Mimetic Theory**:
- Defined as human imitation of external reality and others' desires
- Goes deeper to reveal the key thing about desire: it is awakened by and follows the desires of another (the "model" or "mediator")
- Replaces the idea of the sovereign, autonomous individual with a passive, "disorienting hall of mirrors" self

**Examples of Mimetic Desire**:
- Children learning skills through observation and imitation
- Teenagers fascinated by celebrities or wannabes
- Advertising drawing desire into niche markets
- Violent media awakening violent desires

**Mimetic Theory in Literature**:
- Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream: "love by another's eyes"
- Dostoyevsky's The Eternal Husband: desire provoked by a model
- Woody Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona: unstable and unflattering mimeticism of romantic desire

**Mimetic Desire Dynamics**:
- Triangular, with the subject desiring the object because the mediator (model) desires it
- Acquisitive mimesis: directing desire toward an object, losing sight of the object itself
- Metaphysical desire: becoming caught up in the mediator

**Mimetic Mediators**:
- Can be fictional (e.g., characters in novels)
- Primary and secondary socialization: proximal vs. distal mediators


#### Mimetic Theory: Desire, Rivalry, and Envy in Human Relationships

**Mimetic Theory and Mimetic Interference**

**The Role of Entwined Desires and Rivalry**
- **Mutual envy and rivalry**: state of mimetic interference, particularly among children (18)
  - Intense desire draws to object another desires, leading to envy (19)
  - Skillful adults learn to conceal such desires to avoid stirring up envy and rivalry (19)
- **Envy detaches from object and fixates on model of desire** (20)
  - Can lead to ambivalence towards employers, leaders, or heroes (20)
- **Escalation to extremes**: shift from external to internal mediation (22)
  - External mediation: relatively stable and uncontroversial (23)
  - Internal mediation: model becomes obstacle to fulfillment of desires they awakened (23)
  - Envy turns into desire to thwart rivals, returning attention to object (26)
- **Double mediation** or reciprocal mediation: desire to thwart rivals replaces original object desire (25)
- **Scandal**: addictive and obsessive objects that attract and repel, such as drugs, sex, power, and morbid competitiveness (28)
  - Represents a chronic fascination in the escalating reaches of mimeticism (30)

**Identification with Rival**
- **Mimeticism contagion**: spares no one; model becomes disciple to own disciple and vice versa (32)
- Subject and model become indistinguishable "mirror doubles" or "monstrous doubles" in terminal phase of mimeticism (31)
- Status, prestige, or honor becomes sole desired object (22)


#### Mimetic Theory: Modernity, Desire, and Internal Mediation

**Girard's Theory of Mimesis: Internal Mediation and Modernity**

**Mimetic Dynamics in Modernity**
- **Metaphysical desire**: created by rivalry, no tangible reality
- Seeked in being of models or plurality of models
- Leads to ontological sickness and conflictual mimesis
- Focus shifts to scapegoating a rival for restoring order

**Modernity and Internal Mediation**
- Anyone can observe lifestyles of the rich and famous on TV, leading to desire for emulation (internal mediation)
- Social shift from external to internal mediation: no clear social hierarchy, anyone can become a model
- End of divine right of kings, democratization, and "men will become Gods for each other"

**Hobbes' Analysis of Modernity as Mimetically Volatile**
- Equality leads to rivalry and "warre . . . of every man, against every man"
- Modern mood: never-quite-satisfied, competitive, attempting to distinguish oneself from the crowd

**Scheler's Analysis of Ressentiment (Jealousy) in Modernity**
- Aristocratic sensibility opposed to modern trends
- Perceived the grotesque element of the era but did not suspect its tragedy

**Girard's Apocalyptic Assessment of Modernity as the Final Stage in History**
- Deteriorating human social relations, personal instability, and madness underpin his emerging apocalyptic assessment.


#### Exploring Interdividual Influence in Mental Illness: From Hysteria to Psychosis

**The Unconscious: An Interdividual Perspective**

**Mimesis and the Mirror of Mental Illness**
- **Hysterical Neurosis**: Attempted camouflage of interdividual influence
  - Rival or obstacle manifested as symptoms (e.g., paralyzed limb, anxiety)
- **Hypnosis**: Temporary cessation of hysterical symptoms through overcoming unacknowledged model influence
  - New unified self constituted by hypnotist/model's desire
- **Demonic Possession vs. Hysteria**:
  - Demonic possession: Cathartic form admitting mimetic influence (e.g., Tarantism)
  - Hysteria: Interdividual influence denied, "unconscious" invented

**The Devil as Mimetic Principle**
- **Oughourlian**: The devil represents extremes of the concrete and potentially dangerous mimetic principle
  - Not the supernatural figure of popular imagination
- **Girard and Oughourlian**: Offer an alternative, interdividual account of unconscious phenomena
  - Hypnosis provides empirical confirmation of Girard's mimetic theory
  - Aim to unseat Cartesian rational individual in modern Western philosophical anthropology

**Mimesis and Modernity's Discomfort with Madness**
- **Girard**: The madman's behavior is unsettling, not because supernatural but due to the same mimetic game in exaggerated form
- **Modernity**: Remains wedded to myth of rational individual, copes uneasily with madness

**Mimesis and Mental Illness: Interdividual Dynamics**
- **Psychotic vs. Neurotic Conditions**:
  - Psychosis: Persists while denying interdividual dynamic (metaphysical hubris)
    - Delirium: "obligatory entrance of a desire that imbeds itself in the impasse of the obstacle-model"
  - Neurosis: Interdividual influence acknowledged to some extent
- **Mirror Neuron System**: Escalates impact of rivalry through other cerebral systems


#### Comparison of Girard's Mimetic Theory and Freud's Psychoanalysis: Rivalry and Desire

**Mimetic Theory vs. Freudian Psychoanalysis**

**Girard's Critique of Freud**:
- Girard saw Freud as a "great rival" for his development of the mimetic theory
- Freud saved the role of great rival for the father, while Girard denied Freud's insights about mimeticism
- Girard felt defensive against giving an inch to Freud, fearing he would be "completely swallowed by him"

**Differences Between Mimetic Theory and Psychoanalysis**:
- In psychoanalytic theory, the **unconscious** is seen as an individual repository of repressed trauma, while Girard's subject is imbricated in a public field of misrecognized beliefs and behaviors
- Psychoanalysis denies the necessary link to the mimetic model of desire, deepening bourgeois individualism
- Freud standardizes positions that exist only as functions of each other, while Girard insists on a smooth continuum of mimetic phenomena across neurotic and psychotic "conditions"

**Critique of Freudian Concepts**:
- **The Oedipus complex**: Girard argues it is based on the Platonic reification of mimetic relations into intrapsychic states, turning something relational into an individualistic, static entity
- **Death instinct**: Freud created it to account for suffering-inducing behavior in non-neurotic patients, which Girard sees as more readily explained in mimetic terms
- **Narcissism and the Oedipus complex**: These are present in Girard's attempt to "complete Freud" by offering a more relational, mimetic perspective

**Mimetic Theory vs. Structuralism and Psychoanalysis**:
- Both structuralism and psychoanalysis reify difference, turning the undifferentiated into a real category of thing (a "monster")
- Girard argues that the three great modern intellectual movements of structuralism, Marxism, and psychoanalysis all share this tendency to create more and more essences to contain dynamic processes within a system of archetypes


#### Exploring Mimetic Rivalry and Family Influence in Literature and Culture

**Dostoyevsky and Mimetic Rivalry in Father-Son Relationships**

**Mimetic Rivalry Between Fathers and Sons**:
- Fathers who become rivals to their sons tend to be less like fathers and more like brothers
- If they maintain their fatherly distance, they will avoid becoming rivals to their sons
- "Father Karamazov is certainly a mimetic rival for two of his sons, but this is precisely because he no longer has anything of the father in him"

**Implications of Abandoning Repressive Parenting**:
- Traditional parental socialization based on hierarchy and discipline has become a thing of the past
- Younger "dads" dress like "dudes" and "hang out" with their sons, while attractive mothers swap jeans and cosmetics with teenage daughters
- This generation shows a marked resistance to external control and objective standards of accountability

**Mimeticism and the Desire for Differentiation**:
- As barriers to individualism are removed, "I" and "my" become less differentiated from "you" and "yours"
- Mimeticism requires the possibility if not the fact of repression to call forth an eternal vigilance
- In a society that believes in being enlightened but in actuality projects mimetic difficulties onto institutions, we crave differentiation

**Family of Origin and Mimetic Patterns**:
- Early conditioning determines our greater or lesser mimetic vulnerability
- Attachment issues can influence emotional development and the formation of our mimetic patterns
- Positive role models in early childhood foster a firm, confident self, while shame and lack of self-acceptance are rooted in incompetent, preoccupied, or narcissistic parents


#### Mimetic theory: Desire, Narcissism, Coquetry, and Human Paradoxes.

**Freud's Approach vs. Girard's Mimetic Theory**

**Freud's Perspective**:
- Narcissism is one of two fundamental desires, located within the self
- Narcissism leads to indifference or excessive attention towards objects
- Freud sees narcissism as a weakening of desire for external objects

**Girard's Perspective**:
- Rejects Freud's dualistic approach in favor of a single mimetic mechanism
- Narcissism can imbue objects with mimetic intensity and foster altruism
- Views narcissism as a strategy, not an essence, for acquiring "the metaphysical mirage of self sufficiency"
- Labels it "pseudo narcissism" or "coquetry"

**Freud vs. Girard on Gender**:
- Freud: Narcissism is the natural condition of children, with women remaining turned inward
- Girard: Mimesis focuses on the being of individuals, not just their objects

**Coquetry as a Strategy**:
- Coquettes exhibit desire for themselves, which awakens longing in others
- This desire is copied by the coquette, leading to self-love escalation
- Coquettes rely on the admiration of others to maintain their "self-possessed" image

**The Paradox of Human Desire**:
- The more self-centered an individual becomes, the more other-centered they become
- Mimetic desire leads to a mirage of blissful autonomy that is never truly experienced
- This realization can cause disappointment and a shift in desires for new models


#### Exploring Mimetic Desire in Sexuality: Masochism, Sadism, and Homosexuality (Girard)

**Girard's Approach to Homosexuality**
- Girard's views on homosexuality are less clear than desired
- Desire is chiefly mimetic, leaving little room for nonpathological state of homosexuality
- Does not condemn it but acknowledges its complexity as a mimetically driven attraction
- Identifies a version of same-sex attraction in Shakespeare and other literary works
- Recognizes Proust's understanding of erotic modern as possibly influenced by his own homosexuality
- Freud misunderstands homosexuality, seeing it as failure to mature sexually or latent passive desire
- Girard suggests advanced mimetic desire can result in transfer of sexual desire to the rival
- Masochism and sadism are normal examples of advanced mimetic desire, not sexual deviations for Girard

**Masochism and Sadism**
- Masochistic subjects desire the brutalities inflicted by their mediator, embracing defeat and disappointment
- Seeking out increasingly resistant models/obstacles that heighten sense of value invested in the model
- The more resistant the obstacle, the more being it appears to possess
- Masochism is a passionate embrace of the most discouraging obstacles, ensuring relationship mayhem and self-destruction
- Heroes and great figures also mired in this pathology of pride and shame
- Ordinary ambition regularly dissatisfied with attainments, seeking new challenges as insurmountable obstacles


#### Mimetic Desire: Ambition, Masochism, and Sadism in Modern Society

**Mimetic Desire and Masochism**

**Poor Judgment and Ambition**:
- Leadership positions taken despite being "wiser heads" left alone
- Mistaking "walls for doors" in pursuit of distinctiveness

**Snobbisme**:
- Pursuing distinctiveness to an escalating extent in modern conditions of equality
- Bowing before arbitrary prestige and social status

**Counter-Imitation**:
- Proud individuals pursuing courses opposite to those chosen by "winners"

**Antiheroes and Contemptuous Intellectuals**:
- Despising stability of traditional forms, preferring to export their own lack of being
- Linked to the spirit of modern revolutionary movements that end up oppressive

**Romantic Heroes in Late-Twentieth-Century Youth Culture**:
- Personalizing anonymity through identifying with the same hero against all others

**Tabloid Culture and Scandals**:
- Exposing, denouncing, and differentiating at the expense of combatting the scandal

**Vendettas in Public Life**:
- Mimetic brouhaha drawing attention to the "tormentor" rather than the victim

**Internet and Anonymous Hate Campaigns**:
- Seeking a sense of worth through moral rectitude fashioned over against transgressors

**Masochism and Sadism**:
- Shame, weakness, and history of abuse coalesce in mimetic addiction
- Relinquishing victim status for sadistic profile (e.g., violent criminals, workplace bullies, clergy sexual abuse)

**Modernity, Secularization, and "Ontological Sickness"**:
- Myth of cool individualism and metaphysical autonomy
- Denial of models and mimeticism going into the underground or unconscious
- Attachment to desires promising difference, distinctiveness, and enhanced being through internal mediation
- Drawing people into greater similarity despite pursuing individual differentiation at a superficial level.


#### Mimetic Desire, Secularization, and Modernity: Girard's Critique on Self-Creation and Religion.

**Mimetic Desire and Secularization**

**Girard's Perspective**:
- Mimetic desire flees into more imitation in the "insane quest for difference"
- In modern Western society, body piercing, tattooing, and mass-produced replicas are used to express our specialness
- Secularization is a negative force that allows deregulated mimetic desire, which Girard sees as a darker side

**Secularization and Modernity**:
- Secularization is part of the modern Western project of self-creation
- It involves the rejection of God and societal constraints, leading to an increase in rivalry
- This negative aspect of secularization is what allows the "promethean self" to come into its own

**Dostoyevsky and Nietzsche**:
- Dostoyevsky's "underground man" represents the combination of rivalry, undifferentiation, and masochism in modern society
- Nietzsche's "promethean idealism" can replace the gracious God, leading to a "new, final stage of history"

**The Trajectory of "Ontological Sickness"**:
- Each generation embodies one stage of this sickness, which is traced in Proust's work from conventional hypocrisy to final emptiness
- The parents are amazed by the "monsters" their children have become, who fully understand the "bad faith" of middle-class dignity


#### Mimetic Desire: Western Culture's Individualism and Apocalyptic Slide (Modern Literature, Mimesis, and Evolutionary Psychology)

**The Relationship Between Idealism and Mimesis: The Case of Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky**

**The Youth Movement and the Spawning of Manson**
- Mainstream 1960s youth movement: high-minded ideology of individual self-determination
- Sexual revolution led to Stavrogin-like figure of Charles Manson
- Subsequently, mainstream culture became pornographic, characterized by programmatic sexual addiction and exploitation

**The Logical Extension of Hypermimeticism Toward Madness: Nietzsche and Wagner**
- Nietzsche's desire for intellectual and artistic omnipotence
- Wagner became his obstacle and the focus of his ressentiment (resentment)
- Nietzsche attempted to establish his own cult, based on what Wagner tried to do at Bayreuth
- Any Greek would have discerned signs of madness accompanying Nietzsche's unprotected courting of the Dionysian

**The Path Away from Madness: Uneventful Everyday Life and Concrete Responsibilities**
- Being rational is a matter of having objects and being busy with them
- Being mad is a matter of letting oneself be taken over completely by mimetic models

**Modernity's Affliction with Illusory Divinity: Masochistic Subjects and the Cherishing of Negative, Ugly, Indifferent Elements**
- Love for the negative, ugly, rough and coarse, demeaning, dangerous, and indifferent elements in art, architecture, sexuality, and exploration
- These cherished values are a perennial reproach to masochistic subjects, ensuring that everything that threatens and diminishes them develops a sacred aura

**The Apocalyptic Slide Toward Self-Destruction: Mimetic Forces Out of Control**
- Shakespeare's awareness of this apocalyptic slide in Othello and Romeo and Juliet
- Dostoyevsky's exploration of this point, especially in Crime and Punishment with the figure of Raskolnikov

**Hard Evidence for Mimetic Theory: Intersubjectivity and Mirror Neurons**
- Girard believes there is further concrete evidence for mimetic theory, such as Darwin's work on evolution as an inspiration
- Recognition of mimicry and synchronous posture in interpersonal encounters, establishing the bodily sharing of emotions at a largely preconscious level


#### Imitation and mirror neurons: Understanding emotional connections through observing actions and intentions.

**Mimetic Nature of Desire**
- Researchers initially found themselves taking on emotions of therapy patients (nodding off to depressed)
- Actors deeply affected by characters they portray, e.g., Kirk Douglas as Vincent van Gogh
- Stanislavski method acting: realistic portrayal through imaginatively entering into another's emotions
- Lack of connection reported among autistic, psychopaths, blind babies
- Infant intersubjectivity studies by Andrew Meltzoff provided evidence for mimetic nature of desire

**Infant Imitation and Cognitive Development:**
- Infants are native imitators from birth, demonstrated in newborns
- Imitation goes beyond reflex, infants complete actions left incomplete by adults
- Infants intuit goal of action rather than just copying it
- Significant for understanding the development of mind and forming social bonds
- AIM (Active Intermodal Mapping) hypothesis: imitative learning of intentions through bodily processes

**Mirror Neurons:**
- Discovered in monkey brain's F5 area, fire when observing actions
- Fire less strongly when observing humans compared to their own actions
- Precognitive, preconceptual, and prelinguistic understanding of intentions
- Humans have more sophisticated mirror neurons than monkeys
- Broca's area (language generation) lies close to human F5 for enhanced reading of context.

**Human Mirror Neurons:**
- Fire during actions, hearing or speaking related words
- Influence of context read automatically and differently depending on situation
- Support theory of language development from gestures rather than prelinguistic sounds.


### CHAPTER 2: Violence, the Sacred Canopy

**Girard's Understanding of the Sacred and Violence**
* **Sacred Violence**: Mechanism that allowed for human stability and civilization through a collective scapegoat mechanism, where a victim is identified as the cause of mimetic crisis and collectively punished, resulting in social order.
* **Scapegoat Mechanism**: Foundational concept in Girard's understanding of the sacred. It explains how mimetic conflict escalates into reconciliation through the identification and punishment of a single individual or group, creating terror and wonder that forms the basis of religion.
* **Terror and Wonder**: Elements of the sacred as described by Rudolf Otto. Girard reveals their historical roots in the scapegoat mechanism.
* **Religious Practices**: Mediate the truth of the founding murder by referencing it while concealing its shocking nature. Religion served as a cultural expedient for social cohesion and restraint of violence.
* **Human Origins according to Girard**: Based on speculative reconstruction using traces in prohibitions, rituals, and myths. The surrogate victim mechanism is seen as humanity's primary adaptation to its own violent nature, with origins rooted in natural selection and evolution.
* **Counter Narratives of Human Origins**: Contradictory to modern views emphasizing personal spirituality or rational human capacities; instead, Girard shows that religion originally served to address human violence.
* **Mimetic Predisposition to Violence**: Challenges the atheist chic agenda blaming religion for violence while extolling humanity's natural capacity to sort itself out. Girard demonstrates that culturally and historically, the opposite is closer to the truth.


#### Animal behavior and the origins of scapegoat mechanism and human culture

**Animal Behavior and Scapegoat Mechanism**

**Scapegoat Mechanism**:
- Represents an adaptation to resolve conflict
- Origins can be traced back to animal behavior

**Instinctual Dominance Patterns in Animals**:
- Prevent intraspecies violence from becoming lethal
- Animals create pack hierarchies to limit expression of desire and violence

**Animal Rites**:
- Aggression is diverted onto an object or third party, creating a bond between animals
- Suggests a link to human sociality

**Chimpanzee Behavior and the Scapegoat Mechanism**:
- Collective killing and eating of monkey victims among chimpanzees
- Ritual aspects of their hunting
- A stage in the "long evolutionary process" leading to the scapegoat mechanism

**The Ur-Symbol and Human Emergence**:
- Chimpanzee brains not capable of symbolic thinking, which requires a center of signification
- The slain victim is the first object for noninstinctual attention
- The breakdown of dominance patterns as the threshold of human emergence
- The "founding murder" as a catalyst for symbolic thought and cultural development

**How the Founding Murder Caught On**:
- Widespread parallel developments rather than a single moment of illumination
- A process of incremental stabilization, with periods of "relatively original" repeat performances


#### The role of violence and ritual in human development: Girard's theory of scapegoating and the origins of language and culture.

**Mimetic Conflict and Surrogate Victim**

**Scapegoat Mechanism**:
- Consolidates reconciliation of mimetic conflict through the scapegoat mechanism
- Leads to "manipulation and differentiation" of the sign constituted by victimage in various forms, hiding the victim

**Examples of "Manipulation and Differentiation"**:
- Agriculture and animal domestication (Neolithic practices)
- Ritual practices, such as planting seeds or fixed places for rituals
- Emergence of sedentary life due to need for ritual protection

**Ritual Basis of Language Development**:
- Sacred words at the basis of languages
- Rhythms, exchange patterns, and repetitions of ritual in emergence and reinforcement of language

**Origins of Human Evolution**:
- Toolmaking, hunting, and human neoteny (being born relatively undeveloped) require prior religious fear-based taboos and social protection

**Alternative Perspective: Eric Gans' Generative Anthropology**:
- Proposes an alternative, quasi-Girardian position without the primal scapegoating
- Originary scene is a gathering of protohumans reaching for something, resulting in the emergence of the sign
- Sign differentiates and defers, helping suppress resentment by relativizing and introducing distance


#### Origin of Human Culture: Religion, Violence, and Sacred Institutions (Girard)

**Gans vs. Girard on Human Origins:**
- **Gans**: Language emerges first in human interactions, diverting mimetic desire to generate new meanings. The primary linguistic sign precedes syntactical structures.
- **Girard**: Language and culture could not have developed without an embryonic form already in place; otherwise, mimetic violence would have been unstoppable.

**Scapegoat Mechanism and the Emergence of Religion:**
- Scapegoat mechanism: human adaptation to violent nature, enabling progress beyond infighting and establishing cohesion through collective transferences on a reconciliatory victim during mimetic crises.
- Sacred: sum of human assumptions focused on a reconciliatory victim; origins of human culture, including rituals and prohibitions.
- Ritual: first specifically human technique, originating from sacred, eventually leading to modern institutions like the judicial system.

**Sacred Violence in Archaic Religions:**
- Necessary for a while during human history; protected humans from own violence by keeping it transcendent and performing appropriate rites.
- Prohibitions and taboos: signs of danger kept at bay to avoid dangerous mimetic rivalry and potential consequences.
- Identical twins: lack of differences can lead to violence, as seen in exposure at birth or removal of one twin to end mimetic crisis (e.g., Romulus murdering Remus).

**Importance of Religion:**
- Humanizes violence; protects humans from their own violence by making it transcendent.
- Universality of religion justifies its centrality in establishing human cohesion.
- Durkheim's insight: identity of society and religion, forming a sacred canopy that juxtaposes real immanence with transcendental power.


#### Mimetic Crisis, Rituals, and Sacrificial Violence in Mythology and Society

**Mimetic Crisis and Ritual**

**Girard's Perspective:**
- Mimetic crisis leads to violent desymbolization and undifferentiation within kinship systems (incest, Oedipus complex)
- Natural disasters or social disquiet seen as manifestations of this crisis
- Rituals serve to renew pacifying effects through surrogate victims in veiled reenactment of primal murder
- Ritual victim: poison and antidote, concealing community's own role in founding murder
- Sacrificial kingship: monarchy as a social figure with sacred resonances
- Dionysian festivals: allow chaos to return and vanquish it for societal reinforcement

**Mimetic Crisis:**
- Threat of loss of distinction leads to violent mimeticism and boundary violations
- Victims portrayed as gross violators (Oedipus, Royal in Incest Shocker)
- Innocent parties often blamed while guilty party remains hidden

**Rituals:**
- Reenactment of primal murder for social pacification and renewal
- Use of surrogate victims from within the community
- Natural rhythms of death and rebirth incorporated into thinking
- Deep imaginative connection between nature and culture
- Conflation of nature and culture during violent crisis
- Ritual victims are poison and antidote, both hiding and revealing the community's role in founding murder

**Institutions:**
- Sacrificial rituals give birth to institutions like kingship (kings as sacrificial victims)
- Monarchy compared to factories that convert household refuse into fertilizer

**Tragedy:**
- Reveals the pathway from sacrificial immolation to communal catharsis
- Demystification of violence and undifferentiation in society
- Alternation and reversal of roles, divinity circulating like yellow jersey in Tour de France

**Ritual and Science:**
- Surrogate victim provides will to conquer reality for intellectual campaigns
- Rituals help control disorder by pushing impure towards quicker resolution
- Myths provide shelter for development, allowing no progress without them.


#### Exploring Rene Girard's analysis of mythology, persecution texts, and scapegoating (difference and crisis)

**The Role of Religion in Primitive Societies**
* Confronting impurity and undifferentiated states: experimentation on "rotten, spoiled, fermented" substances leads to 'resurrections' like cheese, bread, wine, etc. (Girard)
* Mythology as a way to understand the origins of religion and its role in primitive societies

**Mythology: Transformation and Decline**
* Persecution texts: influenced mob violence against innocent groups (Jews, women accused of witchcraft)
* Characteristics of persecution texts: breakdown of stable order, moral transgressions, random choice of victims
* Stereotypes of persecution: 1) crisis leading to search for a victim; 2) guilt or moral transgression; 3) potential randomness in choosing the victim

**Persecution Texts and Mythology**
* Poisoning accusations against Jews caused mid-fourteenth century plague outbreaks in northern France (Machaut)
* Witches accused of symbolically maintaining stability during uncertain times, often confessed to unthinkable crimes
* Persecution texts remained persuasive despite exaggerated allegations

**Difference and the Persecuted Other**
* Lack of difference within a group can precipitate crises and ignite search for an outsider or scapegoat
* Fear of external differences: race, religion, physical anomalies, etc.
* Immigrants, mentally/physically disabled have struggled for acceptance in monochrome societies
* Difference within the system is less terrifying than difference outside it (Girard)
* Two types of differences: internal and external.


#### Exploring Persecution in Mythology: Girard's Interpretation and Hidden Victims

**Girard's Analysis of Persecution in Mythology**

**Stereotypes of Persecution**:
- Crisis: presence of plague or similar crisis situation
- Crime: characteristic crimes, such as parricide and incest
- Criteria: singling out a victim based on their appearance or other distinguishing features

**The Oedipus Myth as an Example**:
- Contains all three stereotypes of persecution
- Victim (Oedipus) was an outsider, identified by his limp and exposure as an infant

**Distinguishing Myth from Persecution Texts**:
- Mythology's portrayal of the sacred and divine in victims is missing in modern persecutions
- Early modern period marked a shift from this duality, with persecutors only hating their victims

**Concealment in Mythology**:
- Necessary to keep hidden the violent human roots of culture and religion
- Founding murders in myths are often disguised or sanitized

**Examples of Concealed Victim Myths**:
- Aztec myth of Teotihuacan: gods sacrifice themselves to become celestial bodies, but mood of intimidation is present
- Baldr's death from Scandinavian mythology: Baldr is granted protection and then killed by his brother, who was using a mistletoe twig
- Birth of Zeus: Curetes tried to conceal him from murderous Kronos by forming a circle and drowning out his cries

**Evolution of Mythology's Concealment**:
- Early myths were more straightforward in portraying collective murder
- Later myths became more complex, deemphasizing crimes committed by gods to avoid drawing attention to them


### CHAPTER 3: Scripture and Secularization

**Girard's Vision: Scripture and Secularization**

**Third Plank:**
- Identifies Bible as humanity's greatest breakthrough from "the false sacred" and "deviated transcendence"
- Judeo-Christian watershed marks shift to real sacred, genuine transcendence disrupting human cultural dynamics
- Secularization seen as profound and liberating development, but also dangerous since it undermines protection against humanity's violence

**Biblical Breakthrough:**
- Bible begins with mimetic story of Genesis: crisis moments, mythological themes, collective violence
- Hebrew Scriptures offer countervailing voice repudiating persecution and multiplication of saving divinities
- Unexpected survivals and reconciliations suggest breakthrough beyond normal mythological outcomes

**Genesis:**
- Cain murders Abel at foundation of first city, crisis moments, collective violence
- Noah and family survive mimetic catastrophe instead of being victims
- Substitution of ritual circumcision for human sacrifice, arc leading away from human to animal sacrifice

**Myth of Cain:**
- God expresses concern for victim, shift in perspective to the victim's plight
- Violent crisis quickly reasserts itself, but initiative shifts from persecutor to victim
- Abel is first in a long line of innocent victims exonerated in the Bible.

**Joseph and His Brothers:**
- Collective persecution fully visible with young Joseph's expulsion into Egyptian slavery.


#### Joseph's story: Innocent hero versus scapegoat mythology contrasted in Genesis and ancient texts.

**Joseph's Story: A Comparative Analysis**

**Background:**
- Joseph's story in Genesis features themes of deception, scapegoating, and ultimately, redemption
- Similarities to other myths, such as Oedipus and the Egyptian "Tale of Two Brothers"

**Comparative Analysis:**
*Incident with Potiphar's wife:*
  - Joseph is falsely accused of attempting to rape his master's wife
  - Oedipus also accused of transgressing with a family member
  - Differences: Joseph's innocence emphasized, no parricide or incest involved

**Scapegoating:**
*Reactions from Joseph's brothers:*
  - Reuben and Judah stand up for their victimized brother
  - Contrast with parents of Oedipus who see him as guilty

**Later Egyptian Versions:**
*Joseph depicted as a divinity-victim*
*Differences from Genesis:*
  - Joseph not demonized initially, but rather humanized
  - No foundation murders or subsequent divinizations

**Innocence and Forgiveness:**
- Emphasis on Joseph's innocence throughout the story
- Contrast with pagan myth where hero is seen as guilty

**The Ten Commandments:**
- Addressing mimetic rivalry and public violence
- Necessary warnings against behavior heightening conflict and violence.


#### Mimetic Desire in Biblical Law and Prophets: Girard's Interpretation

**Girard's Interpretation of the Decalogue and the Prophets**

**The Decalogue**:
- Consistent with primitive religious prohibitions, but more lucid
- The Tenth Commandment addresses the heart of the matter: mimetic desire for objects belonging to one's neighbor

**The Tenth Commandment**:
- "You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor" (Ex 20:17)
- The key to the Decalogue's distinctiveness
- Seeks to prevent people from fighting by forbidding all objects of desire

**The Prophets**:
- Significant advance on earlier books of the law
- Emphasizes the **Servant Songs of Isaiah**, particularly the fourth song about the suffering servant
- The Servant's sacrifice is allowed, but his innocence is emphasized and his killing at human hands is declared to be undeserved
- Exposes the horror of mimetic crisis and founding murder

**Other Prophetic Texts**:
- **Amos 5:21–24**: First explicit prophetic denunciation of sacrifice, calling for a preferential option for the poor and needy
- **Hosea 4:12–13**: Rejecting false gods in terms of an antisacrificial posture
- **Ezekiel 20:25–26**: Condemns the earlier state of statutes and ordinances
- **Jeremiah 31:33**: Points beyond heteronomy towards a true theonomy - an internalized law of the heart

**Prophetic Figures**:
- **Elijah**: Disavows his violent public career, recognizing God as a still, small voice, not a violent sacred competitor
- **Jonah**: Overcomes anger against Nineveh, embodying forgiveness and personal transformation
- **Ezekiel**: Abandons temple and religion of sacrifice, arrives at a vision for Israel beyond loyalty to a system that God is abandoning


#### Exploring the contrast between ancient violence in religious texts and Girard's perspective on victimhood in the Hebrew Bible.

**Jesus and the New Testament: A Revolutionary Interpretation by René Girard**

**Contrast between Psalms and Greek Mythology:**
- Hot-blooded explicitness contrasted with cold cruelties in pagan texts (C.S. Lewis)
- Persecution criticized, but actual violence often ignored
- Commonness of mob violence in mythology suggests it was more prevalent than acknowledged

**Role of Victims in Psalms:**
- Victim speaks out for the first time in history
- Reveals truth about mythology and primitive sacred
- Contrast between serene harmony of persecutors and sharp contrast of victim's perspective

**Job: A Failed Scapegoat and God's Reality:**
- Job reveals the mythology striving to envelop him, scorning the show trial
- Job not only resists totalitarian contagion but wrests the deity out of the process of persecution
- Real God emerges as the one suffering alongside the victim

**Unfinished Transition in Hebrew Bible:**
- Struggle between sacred violence and emerging God beyond all such projections
- Four series of texts charting development of religious sensibility towards victim rehabilitation

**Impact of René Girard on New Testament Interpretation:**
- Revolutionary hermeneutical strategy
- Christian priests and ministers challenged to move beyond shallow platitudes and conventional approaches
- New Testament reveals a semirealized dream called the Kingdom of God.


#### Exploring Girard's analysis of Jesus, sacrifice, and human culture's violent foundations.

**Girard's Interpretation of Jesus' Sacrifice and Impact**

**Overview:**
- Girard's analysis in "Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World"
- Discussion on how Gospels complete Hebrew Scripture by revealing surrogate victim mechanism

**Scapegoat Mechanism:**
- Satan as a technical term for destructive societal force, not supernatural being
- Scandal and false sacred repression in human culture
- Violence disavowed through tombs and whited sepulchers
- Jesus reveals surrogate victim mechanism in passion narratives

**Jesus' Sacrifice:**
- Necessary step for God to reveal truth of things to humanity
- Not God's doing but a revelation of human culture's violence
- Dismissal of misguided Christian readings as sacrificial religion
- Central text: Colossians 2:13–15 (Jesus' cross erases record against humanity)

**Apocalypse and Modernity:**
- Human violence, not divine terror in apocalyptic texts
- Unprecedented consequences once sacralized victim no longer exists

**Jesus as Countertranscendence:**
- Set against typical human cultural dynamics as bringer of peace
- Born according to Gospels as alien to world of violence
- Jesus' birth described differently from heroic miracle births in mythology.


#### Analysis of Girard's exploration of Jesus' impact and the role of mimetic desire in sacrifice and resurrection.

**Girard's Exploration of Jesus' Historical Impact: The Triumph of His Cross**

**Jesus' Passion Narratives**:
- Confront the world of myth by internal subversion rather than external assault
- Use typical mythic themes to discredit mythical illusions point by point
- Emphasize that Jesus is innocent, revealing the deluded blindness of his persecutors

**The Mimetic Crowd and Sacred Violence**:
- The mimetic crowd and its sacred violence is formidable
- Even Peter is co-opted, overcoming the rationality of Roman law
- The text emphasizes that Jesus' persecutors do not know what they are doing

**The First Definition of the Human Unconscious**:
- Girard sees this as an intersubjective mimetic entrapment rather than the depth dimension of individual minds
- This "méconnaissance" extends to the fact of the whole scapegoating mechanism itself

**John the Baptist's Execution and Its Parallels to Jesus' Passion**:
- The execution of John the Baptist parallels Jesus' passion, verifying the systematic character of evangelical thought on surrogate victimage
- Mimetic dynamics are present, including:
  - Rivalrous brothers
  - Twinned names (Herod/Herodias)
  - The dancing daughter, who borrows her desire for the Baptist's death from her mother
  - Mimetic intimidation of Herod by the dignity of a powerful crowd
  - The Baptist as an obstacle on whom Herod and Herodias were fixated
  - The ritual nature of Herod's birthday celebration, intensifying mimesis to the point of sacrifice

**Mimesis, Obstacle Fascination, and Sacrifice**:
- Mimesis inevitably spawns sacrifice once a particular point of intensity has been passed
- Hate exists without cause or pretext, only intertwined desires buttressed against one another

**The Divinization of the Victim**:
- The belief that Jesus is the slain Baptist resurrected is rejected by the Gospel text
- Peter's denial illustrates the intractability of mimeticism and its escalation toward scapegoating

**Jesus as God's Advocate for Victims**:
- After his ascension, the Holy Spirit takes on the same role as Jesus' advocate for victims
- The Paraclete's message challenges those who maintain the system by unwitting violence to forgive them, as Jesus did


#### The text discusses René Girard's interpretation of the Christian revelation, its unique nature, and cultural impact, revealing collective violence as a lie and ushering in secular modernity.

**The Unique Nature of Christianity's Divinity**

**Jesus' Divinity**:
- Not declared divine by a murderous crowd unified by his death
- Declared divine by a dissident minority
- Differences from pagan resurrection mythologies
    - Witnessed by those who overcome victimization, not those who surrender to it
    - God's act of testimony to Jesus' innocence
    - Not the product of mythical snowballing or collective scapegoating

**The Cross and Paganism**:
- Conquers paganism's way of organizing the world
- Deprives the victim mechanism of concealment
- Exposes the powers and principalities, defeating them
- Provides a theme found in Paul's comments on the ignorance of the powers

**Universality of Victimization**:
- Gospels universalize the rehabilitation of victimized prophets and wrongly accused victims
- Show that victims of all Passion-like murders are victims of the same mob contagion as Jesus
- Make the revelation complete by demonstrating how false gods and violent cultural systems are generated

**Girard's Approach to Divinity**:
- Adheres to the cultural-historical facts of human existence
- Claims Christian uniqueness can be demonstrated scientifically, not requiring faith's validation
- Insists that the superiority of the Bible and Gospels is objectively true

**Christ and Culture**:
- The death of Jesus reveals the truth of surrogate victimization
- Jesus' resurrection is a gift from God, leaving behind an empty tomb
- Gospels slander and undermine archaic religion, ushering in the postsacrificial world
- Secularity and nonreligious holiness begin to replace "cheap togetherness and junk goodness"
- Accommodation with the sacrificial past has led to the enlistment of the Christian revelation in forming a culture of its own


#### The Text Discusses the Collapse of Sacred Victimization and Emergence of Modernity through Christianity's Influence

**The Collapsing Sacred and the Emergence of Modernity**

**Christianity's Impact on Victim Consciousness**:
- Hamerton-Kelly: Christianity is a mixture of Greek philosophy, Jewish moralism, pagan enthusiasm, and Roman bureaucracy
- The Christian hermeneutic of the Cross is the first insight into the pathos of the human enterprise
- Girard observes the old victimizing sacred collapsing under the impact of Christ and his gospel

**The Ephesus Plague Episode**:
- Apollonius, a pagan guru, saved Ephesus from plague by encouraging the crowd to stone a blind beggar
- The crowd was reluctant to cast the first stone
- Jesus' warning in the adultery encounter prevented the mimetic frenzy that would have been unleashed

**Modernity and the Collapsing Sacred**:
- The crucified solidarity of Jesus with the Ephesian beggar began to ruin the empire's appetite for pagan victimage
- Emerging human rights began to put a brake on mimetic snowballing
- Modern dictators often wave the victim flag, demonstrating the problematized making of victims

**Sacrifice Losing Its Sacred Power**:
- When sacrificial cultures understand their own rites too well, they can no longer practice them innocently as before
- Sacrifice evolves in the direction of non-violent mysticism and political manipulation
- Public hangings in the 19th century were seen as an act of barbarity in the service of civilized values


#### Sacred violence and its influence on literature: from medieval sacrifice to modern secularism.

**Impact of Desacralization on Literature**

**Sacrifices as Mob Catharsis**:
- Encouraging public excoriation of victims failed to restrain mimetic escalation of violence
- Failed to unify society in awe of sacred foundations

**Example from "A London Fête" by Coventry Patmore**:
- Dangling corpse hung straight and still
- People engaged in various activities after the show was over
- Two friends fought each other with murderous faces

**Impact on Western Culture**:
- Emphasis on Christ's passion helped turn the cultural tide
- Desacralizing the persecuting crowd freed fiction from traditional burden of sustaining closed, sacrificial cultures
- Emergence of modern individual center stage in literature

**The Role of Sacred Violence in Literature**:
- Christian mythology is unfit for poetic fiction due to undermining setting up a human being on a pedestal
- Renaissance revival of interest in pagan antiquity as an ideal refuge for the old spirit

**Nietzsche and the False Sacred**:
- Nietzsche opposed 19th century positivistic blurring of Christianity and myth
- Identified Christian distinctiveness in its commitment to victim, compared to pagan sacrificial mechanism
- Saw Christianity as promoting an embittered slave morality, favoring real vengeance over eternal return
- Called for the "murder of God" - destruction of old false sacred


#### Nietzsche, Girard, and the Dangers of Rejecting the Biblical Attitude

**Girard's Interpretation of Nietzsche and Modernity**

**Background:**
- Girard believes Nietzsche was driven to madness by his deliberate siding with the violence and deceptiveness of mythology against the non-violence and truthfulness of the biblical attitude.
- Nietzsche's philosophy demanded grandiose indifference to suffering, which led him to a Dionysian worldview that compromised his mental health.

**Impact on Western Thought:**
- Nietzsche's ideas influenced neopaganism and new atheism in the West:
  * Rejection of biblical values
  * Promotion of modern skepticism about religion
  * Attempt to outflank Christianity by borrowing its concern for victims
- Girard sees these movements as a return to archaic sacred practices, masked under secularism and humanism.

**Effect on Society:**
- Neopagan ideas can lead to regression and the perpetuation of violent sacrificial mechanisms in society.
  * Marxist totalitarianism is an example of this (from Bandera's perspective)
- Modern atheism, while claiming to be secular, fails to address the root causes of violence and instead keeps these mechanisms hidden from view.

**Girard's Perspective:**
- Nietzsche's aphorisms call for a new movement towards archaic sacred values that contradict Christianity (the "eternal return").
- Girard believes this is a misguided attempt to evade the gospel's claim and seeks to highlight its potential dangers.
- He emphasizes the importance of resisting this neopagan ideology and maintaining the gains made by Christianity in modern society.


### CHAPTER 4: Modern Institutions and Violence

**Modern Institutions and Violence**

**Girard's Perspective on Modernity**:
- Shift from hierarchy to equality, differentiation to undifferentiation, external to internal mediation
- Increases mimetic risk of envy, rivalry, and violence due to proliferating available mimetic models
- Secularization leads to reduced protection against violence as innocent victims are no longer sacrificial cannon fodder for social order

**Modern Institutions as Restraint**:
- Major modern institutions provide restraint but can no longer be relied upon
- Premodern societies limited internal mediation to preserve themselves from violent disruption
- Secular modernity relies on the nation-state and market with consumer culture to out-threaten, divert, distract, and dilute conflictual mimesis

**Democratic Ideology and Judicial Institutions**:
- Democratic ideology represents civil society values and cooperation, countering obsessive mimetic competition
- Judicial institutions and police forces hold a monopoly on violence, providing reliable redress for victims and deterring offenders

**Technological Capabilities and Market Society**:
- Enhanced technological capabilities and market society allow for proliferation of desirable goods, improving standard of living and keeping mimetic rivalry at bay

**Mass Media**:
- Mass media diverts with sport, entertainment, and gossip to distract from potential violence


#### Modern Katéchon functions: Nation-state and Secular Economics as restraints on violence and chaos.

**The Mass Media as a Katéchon Function**

**Mimetic Models**:
- The mass media presents a wide range of mimetic models beyond those available in small traditional communities
- This reduces the likelihood of internal mediation invading private space and causing conflictual mimesis
- It also ensures that misuse of power is regularly exposed, even at the cost of prurience and disingenuousness
- This has a "safety valve function" similar to democratic and legal institutions

**Objectification of Individual Relations**:
- The mass media contributes to an isolating effect where individuals are decoupled from older kinship networks well-suited for storing, channeling, and unleashing violence

**The Katéchon in Religious Traditions**:
- The Egyptian god Horus was described as a katéchon, representing a divine force restraining the watery chaos symbolized by the Nile-dwelling hippopotamus and crocodile
- The Roman Empire and the Roman Catholic Church have also been identified with the katéchon
- Examples of the katéchon function in Christian contexts include Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor and the secular modern state

**The Secular Modern State as a Katéchon Function**:
- The modern nation-state is one of two major katéchon functions, the other being late capitalist market economics
- Thomas Hobbes realized that the church could no longer fulfill the katéchon function during the Reformation
- The sovereign Leviathan, presiding over a nation-state with a privatized religion, took over the katéchon function
- Dietrich Bonhoeffer identified the katéchon with state power to establish and maintain order

**Civil Religion as a Covert Resacralization of Society and State**:
- The official version of separation between religion and society has led to the widespread coexistence of civil and political resacralization
- Civil religion uses elements of traditional religions for its own purpose, providing a sense of national calling and sacrificial leadership
- Examples include Arlington National Cemetery on Good Friday, Lincoln Memorial, and "the Wall" commemorating American sacrifices in Vietnam


#### Exploring sacrifice, mimesis, and market economics in modern society.

**The Afrikaner Regime and Political Religion**
- The Afrikaner regime in South Africa aimed to limit internal mediation through racial segregation endorsed by the Dutch Reformed Church
- Apartheid was condemned as antithetical to the gospel by Anglican saints like Father Trevor Huddleston and Archbishop Desmond Tutu
- Political religion flourished in the 20th century marked by dogmatic ideologies, personality cults, and implacable hatred in the name of nation-states
- Fascist and communist alternatives proliferated, and any countervailing Christian influence was firmly repressed
- Political religions may recede in the 21st century as a new sacred emerges with market forces defining and dominating our times

**The Market and the Sacred (Late Modern Capitalism)**
- The market and economy can be seen as the "katéchon" or balancing force that rallies self-interest of individuals
- Blaise Pascal's discussion of "private vices, public benefits" and Adam Smith's "invisible hand" theory show how everyone's pursuit of private interest yields heightened prosperity for all
- Neoliberal economics sees restricted wealth and comfort today ensuring prosperity for tomorrow's multitude through the trickle-down effect
- This has a sacrificial dimension, with the market becoming the meeting place of secularization and the new sacred of consumer culture

**Gift Exchange, Scarcity, Aspiration, Consumption**
- Gift exchange was a pacifying ritual in primitive societies to maintain social cohesion
- Market-style exchange was reserved for outsiders who could be cheated and victimized to preserve peaceful relations within the community
- With the collapse of the older solidarity, scarcity became individualized, prompting a lifetime of aspirational acquisitiveness
- Late capitalist culture isolates units of aspirational scarcity and preoccupies them with meeting their own mimetic needs, ensuring indifference to others and "losers" in the global economy
- The desire to achieve a certain fictive middle-class identity drives the pursuit of status as today's leading Western metanarrative, negating any criticism of the economic system.


#### Mimetic dynamics in consumer culture: desire, social comparison, inequality, shame, and violence.

**Mimetic Dynamics in Consumer Culture**

**Keeping Up with the Joneses:**
- Mimetic need for self-differentiation in modern societies
- Expresses itself as a "positional arms race"
- Social construction of scarcity and prestige goods

**Impact on Middle Class:**
- Aspiration and shame dynamics
- Economic boom-and-bust cycles
- Resentments of the middle classes
- Body modification as a sign of status

**Consumerism as Unconscious Discipline:**
- Objects serve as markers of difference
- Desire flows into culturally mandated channels
- Advertising provides major training

**Baudrillard's Perspective on Consumer Society:**
- Life in modern societies is one of immanence in an order of signs
- Goods serve primarily as markers of difference
- Disparate phenomena interlinked: affluence, violence, euphoria, depression

**Mimetic Understanding:**
- Socioeconomic dynamics are mimetic in nature
- Internal mediation contains anger generated by shame
- Consumer lifestyle drives an endlessly growing economy
- Social isolation ensures frustrations remain unfocused

**Impact of Inequality:**
- Enhanced burdens of shame, envy, and frustrated reaction
- Demographic research shows correlation between inequality and social problems (mental illness, obesity, teenage birth rates, etc.)
- Reducing income inequality can lead to improvements in quality of life, trust levels, and overall wellbeing.


#### Mimetic Desire, Economy, Sacred Violence, and Modern Civilization.

**The Mimetic Phenomenon and Modern Economy**

**Girard's Perspective**:
- Dismisses the idea of "free competition always being good" as "absurd"
- Recognizes that our late modern economy has successfully managed to contain personal and social dysfunction, despite socioeconomic distress

**The Mimetic Phenomenon in Late Capitalism**:
- The mass production of desirable goods through the market restrains mimetic rivalry by allowing people to have replicas of objects of desire
- This helps manage envy and keeps up with societal standards
- However, this unbridled consumerism is sustainable only at the cost of environmental damage

**The Market as a Religious Phenomenon**:
- Money originated in the context of sacrifice
- The market has a "sacred order" similar to ancient religious practices, with limitations and potential crises
- Late capitalism is seen as a combination of archaic sacrificial basis and aspects of Jewish-Christian revelation
- Girard believes this positive use of mimetic rivalry in the market is inconceivable without the cultural dissemination of moral rules from Christianity

**The Global Economy and Globalization**:
- The global economy represents the end of older, local, enclosed social orders of the "violent sacred" type
- This spreading influence of Christianity into every sphere of human activity includes aspects of the global economy
- Girard believes this Christian sensibility makes it unlikely that neoliberal economic theory will progress unchallenged

**Critiques from the Left**:
- Dupuy argues that those sidelined and struggling under global capitalism are not "sacrificial victims" because they succumb to indifference, not fascination
- Girard's response could be that modern quasi-survivals of archaic sacrificial systems cannot successfully divinize their victims
- The phenomenon of political correctness means the excluded get more attention than Dupuy acknowledges


#### Exploring Mimetic Violence: Self-Sacrifice and Eating Disorders in Modern Society.

**Erich Kitzmüller's Perspective on Market Society**
- Market society is a mutant of sacrificial order
- Mobilizes mimetic energy into technopathical expansion
- Contains violence inside the market

**Girard's Critique of Market Society as Sacrificial Cult**
- Not fully equating victims with deliberate human slaughter in archaic rituals
- Global market is not a technical apparatus to kill people like gas chambers
- Inevitably produces injustice and violence, but protects us from greater violence
- Signals of backlash against the religion of the market at its peak

**Mimetic Violence in Secular Modern World**
- Blurring violence against self and other
- Self-sacrifice as "ontological sickness"
- Example: Eating Disorders (anorexia, bulimia)
  - Channeled among girls and new breed of wan, skinny youths
  - Mimetic rejection of traditional masculine models
  - Accentuating lips and breasts as counterpressure
- Anorexic and bulimic self-sacrifice reflecting minimalist movement in secular modernity
- Fashion victims represent a social crisis and return to archaism
- Anorexic women want to be champions of their category.


#### Mimetic Violence and Sacrifice: Anorexia, Abortion, Crime, and Serial Killers

**Mimesis, Sacrifice, and Modernity: An Exploration of Themes in René Girard's Thoughts**

**Anorexia as Mimesis and Sacrifice:**
- Disorder triggered by mimetic obstacle (boyfriend's comment)
- Fatal condition kills young women
- Thinness becomes societal ideal, affecting more areas of life
- Link between modernity, rationality, and control
- Overweight bodies symbolize undiscipline, excess, and breakdown
- Lean figures represent power and virtuous consumption
- Classes of overweight "pharmakoi" for public ridicule
- Western consumption spirals out of control

**Abortion as a Symbolic Crisis:**
- Unwilling pregnancy viewed as threat to being
- Abortion resembles child sacrifice with cultural imperative
- Desire's mimetic nature upends American culture if known widely
- Women's sexuality compared to men's in modern society
- Sacrificial system requires sacrifice for maintenance
- Breakdown of sacrificial system threatens women with emptiness

**Crime, Punishment, and Sacrifice:**
- Social cohesion celebrated at expense of victims
- Monsters externalize our own violence, allowing disavowal and control
- Belief in monsters proves false reconciliation among violent rivals
- Serial killers emerge in modern societies with drained prohibitions
- Mimetic envy leads to murderous rivalry against everyone
- Reversal of direction within the sacrificial pattern of violence
- American culture as a civil religiously sacrificial society.


### CHAPTER 5: War, Terror, Apocalypse

**Chapter 5: War, Terror, Apocalypse**

**Modern Politics and the Katéchon:**
- Modern political thinkers recognized fearful creakings of modern state development as katéchon under strain
- This problem has escalated globally with cultural erasure and potential for mimetic crisis

**Warfare in Modern Times:**
- Conflicts multiplied beyond nation-state boundaries
- Ordinary populations increasingly drawn into bloodlust and scapegoating
- Clash of civilizations better understood as global civil war
- Warfare becoming more intense and indistinguishable from terrorism
- Modern wars resembling civil wars, overcoming state's katéchon

**Modern Wars and the Role of Victimhood:**
- Universal claim to victim status justifying atrocities
- Leaders embodying victim and persecutor roles in totalitarian regimes
- Mirror doubling between factions fueled by shame, envy, and humiliation
- Modern warfare characterized by personal hatred, making it difficult to contain

**Carl Schmitt's Proposal:**
- Embrace of "official" enemies for principled commitment to impersonal national enmity
- Militarism as a new katéchon function to restrain violence
- Criticized for denying transcendent reasonableness and moral humanism in preventing violence

**Religion and Violence:**
- Secular modernity not inherently tranquil; Neopagan revival sees religion as solution to violence
- William T. Cavanaugh's argument against blaming religion for violence
- Girard's theory about violent preservation of social orders, including secular ones.


#### Exploring Religion, Violence, and Mimesis in Terrorism: Girard's Perspective

**Girard's Theory and Terrorism**

**Background:**
- Girard's theory cannot be used to link religion to violence without ambiguity (Cavanaugh)
- Wars of religion in Europe led to privatization of religion and state's resacralization (secularist argument)

**Wars of Religion:**
- Involved much intrareligious violence, collaboration between religions
- A form of Orientalist discourse reinforcing dichotomy between West and other cultures (Cavanaugh)

**Terrorism:**
- Religiously themed terrorism on the rise since 1960s (Girard)
- Mimetically mediated through masochistic obstacle fixation (Dupuy)
- Demonization and divinization of victims, e.g., suicide bombers
- Socially liminal figures of disorder best disposed of ritually

**Modernity and Terrorism:**
- Not an inexorable disenchantment but a resurgence of archaic sacred (Girard)
- Hatred towards the West not due to opposition or foreignness, but familiar competitive spirit (Girard)
- Mimetic entanglement with modernity and values (Anspach)

**Islamist Terrorism:**
- New Communism: rallying point for frustrated victims in mimetic rivalry with the West (Girard)
- Not solely an Islamic-Western clash, but a planetwide reaction (Bin Laden's rhetoric)

**Girard's Views on Islamist Terrorism:**
- Declares it a form of rallying and mobilizing third world victims in relations of mimetic rivalry with the West (Le Monde interview)
- Careful not to contribute to fraudulent propaganda against Muslims.


#### Analysis of Rene Girard's views on the role of mimetic desire and sacrificial violence in the rise of Islamist terrorism.

**Girard's Analysis of 9/11 Attacks**

**Two Main Points**:
- Mimetic rivalry within a unified global consciousness
- Role of sacrifice within Islam

**Mimetic Rivalry and the War on Terror**:
- War on terror as two crusades, with one being more powerful due to religious underpinning
- Bin Laden's wealth as a motive, not just resentful poverty
- Western middle-class rivalry as a similar dynamic
- Post-9/11 extremism as a "last metastasis of the cancer" in the Western world
- Undifferentiation between radical Islamist terrorists and their Western model-rivals

**Role of Islam and Archaic Sacrifice**:
- Terrorism hijacks religious codes for its own purposes
- Islam lacks Christianity's awareness of the founding murder
- Expansionist Islamic impulse toward assimilating the West
- Militant Islam as a political-religious hybrid of terroristic form, "something both very new and very primitive"

**Link to Modern Totalitarianism**:
- Terrorism linked to modern totalitarianism (Mao, Lenin)
- Militant Islam as an insider to modernity's dynamics


#### Girard's analysis of Islamic terrorism: Mimetic clash within globalized modernity.

**Girard's Perspective on Post-9/11 Violence: A Clash of Mimetically Driven Narratives**

**Archaic Religion and Modern Weapons**:
- The archaic barbarian types of violence are back, despite the availability of sophisticated means of destruction
- Militant Islam uses modern weapons in its reaction against the loss of prohibitions once secured under the archaic sacred

**Resentment and Differences Within Globalized Modernity**:
- The antipathy of radical Islam is not just secular Western modernity, but Christianity itself
- The Muslim religion has copied Christianity, but has not destroyed the sacrifice of archaic religion as extensively
- This leads to a mimetic struggle within globalized modernity rather than a clash of civilizations

**Mirror Games and the Execution of Osama bin Laden**:
- Bin Laden's antipathy was a payback exercise against Western provocations, not just a clash of civilizations
- The execution of an unarmed bin Laden by U.S. Navy SEALs reflects this mirror doubling

**Modernity and Islamic Militancy**:
- Jihad is one version of Islamic modernity, alongside a more literate, commercial, and media-supported form
- Islamic militancy emerges in response to Western provocations and the failures of Islamic nationalism
- The radicalization process is best understood as an attempt to abolish, transcend, preserve, and transform modernity rather than reject it.


#### Exploring interconnected roots of jihad: Western influence, messianic ideologies, and frustrated aspirations.

**Jihad: An Intra-Islamic and Western Issue**

**Hyperculturalization of the Issue**:
- Hafaid Gafaiti's term for the "hyperculturalization" approach by Huntington overlooks:
  - Western mendacity (deception)
  - Intra-Islamic provocations

**Shared Patrimony in Ancient Gnostic and Late Medieval Ideas**:
- Laurent Murawiek identifies a shared patrimony between Islam and the West
- Includes ancient Gnostic antiworldliness and late medieval notions of absolute divine sovereignty
- Fueled a utopianism extending from:
  - Medieval Christian apocalyptic
  - Islamic expectations of the Mahdi
  - 19th-century nihilism spawning 20th-century totalitarian utopianism
  - Jihadism

**Modern Complicity in Spawning Radical Islam**:
- Marxist anticolonial rhetoric via Algeria
- 1979 Iranian Revolution
- Red Army training of Muslims in Soviet statecraft
- Grooming of Palestinian extremists by Cuban State Intelligence
- World War I incitement of Muslims against England by Germany
  - Grand Mufti of Jerusalem helped found a training school in Dresden for Muslim SS chaplains
  - Received a tour of the Auschwitz gas chambers from Eichmann
- America supporting the Taliban against the Soviets in Afghanistan

**Similarities between Suicide Bombing and Western Warfare**:
- Talal Asad highlights similarities, suggesting suicide bombers belong to a modern Western tradition of armed conflict
- To save their nation or foundation of its state, it may be necessary to act without moral constraints

**Jihadi Motivations**:
- Frustrated aspirations and rivalry are widely acknowledged motives
- Young recruits to terror groups are unemployed, unable to marry, and experience a "kind of sexual despair"
  - This leads to violent acts of symbolic empowerment
- Religion provides a focus for dissent and the recovery of lost control

**The Jihadi as a Typical Modern Type**:
- Dostoyevskian underground psychology at work in the revolutionary
- The object of desire, as designated by others, is an occasion of offence (scandal), multiplied by the number of models designating it
- Reminds McKenna of American campus radicalism and its resentment-fueled vocational craving


#### Mimetic theory analysis of radical Islam and apocalyptic violence in modern society.

**Understanding Terrorism: Mimetically Driven Political Religion**

**Raban's Perspective on Radical Islamist Terrorism**
- Comparison of Sayyid Qutb and Mohamed Atta's disillusionment and radicalization
  * Finding spiritual dissolution in American culture
  * Glamorization of disappointments through Islamist ideology
- John Walker Lindh as a "dark and extreme version" of an American type
  * Outsider or misfit within society
  * Adoption and reclamation of traditional Islamic values

**Ed Husain's Story: From Activist to Reclaimer**
- Background in Hizb-ut-Tahrir group in London
  * Contempt for ordinary Muslims, power obsession, internal conflict
- Disillusionment with Islam during studies in Saudi Arabia
  * Loss of touch with the truth of Islam
  * Succession of mimetic models and archaic sacred tendencies within modernity

**Girard's Insights on Mimetically Driven Political Religion and Apocalypse**
- Accelerating trend towards denouement: military or environmental apocalypse, personal conversion
- Apocalypse as self-destructiveness, not divine violence on unrighteous
- Clausewitz's concept of a mimetic duel in warfare and its escalation to extremes.


#### Exploring the Escalation of War: Clausewitz and Mimetic Theory's Perspective

**Clausewitz's On War: The Escalation of Warfare to Extremes**

**Background:**
- Clausewitz's seminal work, On War, discusses the "extreme" in war as a clash of unconstrained forces
- Three extremes: reciprocation of force, threat of greater counterforce, and calculation of required force to defeat an enemy

**Clausewitz's Perspective:**
- Escalation unlikely due to checks and balances imposed by constraints on military endeavor
- War as a manifestation of violence may usurp policy if unchecked
- Fear of totalizing bloodlust and will to power in modern warfare

**Girard's Interpretation:**
- Clausewitz's ideas enabled Girard to articulate the relationship between mimetic theory and history
- Modern warfare lost its former character as a matter of rules, customs, and limited violence
- Napoleonic era marked a sea change towards totalizing bloodlust and will to power in warfare

**Mimetic Theory:**
- Reciprocal action accelerates the escalation to extremes
- Model of desire possesses something desirable, leading to war obsession
- Attacker wants peace, defender wants war
- Vigorous defense ensures escalation rather than restraint of violence

**Examples:**
- Napoleon's Russian campaign: Clausewitz saw it as a turning point towards totalizing warfare
- French and German relations: Mimetically locked in conflict from the pope to de Gaulle
- Nazi-Bolshevik mirror doubling in World War II, followed by Soviet-American Cold War


### Conclusion

**Girard's Vision: The Three Elements of Secular Modernity**

**Mimeticism**:
- Shift to internal mediation without sacred protection is the long and short of secular modernity
- Seeds of secular modernity found in the Bible and Jesus' ministry, rather than ideological or functional definitions

**Sacrifice**:
- The archaic false sacred (prohibitions, rituals, myths) undermined by Judeo-Christian vision
- Church has failed to live up to bolder vision
- Persistent reappearances of false sacred

**Overcoming the False Sacred**:
- Nation-state, market economics, "war as continuation of policy" have served a katéchon function
- World veering toward apocalypse without unifying, pacifying outcome of archaic sacred

**The Kingdom Growing in Secret**:
- Mankind will destroy earth if trapped in mimetic zweikampf
- Escalation to extremes of violence beyond control
- Christianity offers a choice: conversion beyond moral black-and-white thinking

**Conversion and the Christian Vision**:
- Sharing in Christ's nonrivalrous desire uproots self-definitional hatred and violence
- Powerlessness, not power, can truly change the world

**Literary Conversions**:
- Dualistic black-and-white thinking: heroes and villains
- Great writers demystified of pride and vanity of mimeticism
- Examples: Proust, Dostoyevsky, Augustine, Dante, Sassoon

**Truth and the Desire for Substantial Being**:
- Conversion to truth about ourselves and mimetic entanglements
- Being we lack comes as a gift from God, as revealed in The Winter's Tale and the Gospel.


#### Girard's spiritual journey and conversion through mimetic theory and Christ's example

**Shakespeare's Understanding of Resurrection**
- Shakespeare's genius enabled him to recapture the nonmagical and yet nonnaturalistic quality of the Gospels' resurrection
- The statue scene reminds us of the physical nature of resurrection in contrast to the spiritual realm

**Girard's Conversion Story**
- Girard was an autodidact from a young age, struggling with institutional belonging
- Traumatic experiences with America after its liberation of France and rejection of avant-garde literary theory led to intellectual paralysis
- Landed a job at Duke University in the pre-civil rights South where he found purpose and developed a distinctive method of approaching texts
- Discovered mimetic theory through reading French novels, despite his disdain for erudition and philosophical language
- At age 35, during writing Deceit, Desire, and the Novel, Girard underwent a Christian conversion while on the Baltimore-Philadelphia train line
- The discovery of a potentially cancerous lump on his forehead led to a focused Lenten discipline and eventual clear test results during Holy Week, 1959
- Girard became an ordinary Catholic layman who continues to go regularly to mass

**Mimesis and Redeemed Mimetic Desire**
- Mimesis is not the problem; it is mimetic rivalry that is destructive
- Mimesis elevates us beyond animal instincts, but we need to learn its rules to overcome its destructive aspect
- The right model for desire is Jesus, who desires only to do God's will and bless others without rivalry
- Imitating Christ as a nonrivalrous model establishes us as free people
- This conversion process involves spiritual disciplines of renunciation, such as plucking out the eye or cutting off the hand that causes sin

**Three Traditional Christian Options for Counterpractice**
- Monogamous marriage as a counterpractice in the contemporary Western culture of hypermimetic sexual deregulation.


#### Renouncing violence and finding new models of desire through mimeticism and Christian conversion.

**Mimeticism and Sexual Promiscuity**
- **Girard's Response**: Mimeticism promoting sexual promiscuity is a misconception; the monogamous relationship is the greatest achievement of human culture and solution to the sexual dilemma.

**Contemplative Prayer and Mimetic Desensitization**
- Grote reinterprets contemplative prayer in terms of mimetic desensitization
- The stilling of the mimetic process is the essence of silence, allowing us to step out of mimeticism and become more "free" and "individual".
- Contemplative prayer decouples us from the mimetic matrix, calming our incessant mimetic connectedness.
- Devotional focus on icons, candles, crosses, or the eucharistic Host can shift mimetic attention away from less worthy models of desire.

**Monastic Communities and Redeemed Desire**
- The carefully handled status and offices within monastic communities foster a pattern of redeemed desire.
- Renouncing violent posture towards others is a key aspect of conversion to Christ in the Gospel.

**Conversion and the Kingdom of God**
- Conversion to Christ means renouncing our own violent posture towards others, refusing retaliation and revenge.
- The Gospel substitutes a single command: "give up retaliation and revenge in any form".
- The Kingdom of God is about giving up disputes when mimetic rivalry is beginning to take over, helping victims, and refusing all violence.

**Divine Withdrawal and Self-Effacement**
- To imitate Christ is to refuse to impose ourselves as a model and always efface ourselves before others.
- The purpose of the Incarnation was to finish all religions, whose sacrificial crutches had become ineffective.
- The death of the gods is simply the same thing as an essential withdrawal in which Christ asks us to see the new face of the divine.


#### Girard's perspective: Christianity as nonmodel for self-effacement and withdrawal from false sacred power

**Girard's Perspective on Jesus and False Gods:**
- Girard distances Jesus from false gods, marking the end of religion with his incarnation
- Mimetic grandiosity of sacred gives way to self-effacement, making "the nonmodel model" the new norm
- Desire depicted as absence, silence, withdrawal, and nonpresence in secular imagination

**Christianity and Atheism:**
- Christianity closer to atheism than archaic sacred due to lack of sense of divine power
- Secular modernity's existential homelessness and silent contemplation embody true spirituality
- Authentic spirituality contrasts with worldly unity and togetherness concealing victims

**Modeling Christ:**
- Paul, as a model, commands followers to be like him in imitating Christ
- Christ and saints are still to be imitated but not in rivalrous sense of worldly success
- Withdrawal from worldly involvement and egotistical self-assertion essential for spiritual growth

**Girard's View on Desire:**
- Refusal to participate in world making, empire building, grand ideological scheming
- True Word of God offers an alternative to hollow mimetic fascination
- No cultural place for gospel but its presence is sacramental and inviting to mystery

**Girard's Impact on Theology:**
- Offered a genuinely post-Hegelian account of Christian eschatology and apocalyptic
- Unrelenting historical advance of the resurrection's impact contrasted with apparent decline under secular modernity
- Power that undid archaic sacred remains, but cannot be triumphalized or institutionalized.
