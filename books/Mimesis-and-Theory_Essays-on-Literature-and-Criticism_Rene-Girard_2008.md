# Mimesis And Theory Essays On Literature And Criticism Rene Girard 2008

> Mimesis and Theory brings together twenty of René Girard's uncollected essays on literature and literary theory, which, along with his classic, Deceit, Desire, and the Novel, have left an indelible mark on the field of literary and cultural studies. Spanning over fifty years of critical production, this anthology offers unique insights into the origin, development, and expansion of Girard's "mimetic theory"―a groundbreaking account of human interaction and of the genesis of cultural forms. The essays run the gamut of Western literary culture, from Racine and Shakespeare to the existentialist writings of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. The authors who have most influenced Girard―Stendhal, Proust, and Dostoevsky―receive extended treatment, and Girard's observations on the changing landscape of literary studies are chronicled in several essays devoted to psychoanalysis, formalism, structuralism, and post-structuralism. Though at times overshadowed by his work in religious and cultural anthropology, Girard's work in the area of literary studies has been the wellspring of his thought. All of the essays in this volume develop the idea that the greatest authors are also the greatest students of human nature, for their artistic intuitions are generally more penetrating than the analyses of the philosophers or the social scientists. Girard does not offer us a theory of literature but literature as theory. - [Mimesis and Theory_Essays on Literature and Criticism_Rene Girard_2008](https://www.amazon.com/Mimesis-Theory-Literature-Criticism-1953-2005/dp/0804755809?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

- Co-organized conference at Johns Hopkins (1966) on languages of criticism and sciences of man
- Defended critical avant-garde against literary establishment's attack
- Rejected New Criticism's anti-scientific aesthetism and literary history's scientific anti-aestheticism

**Girard's Approach to the Literary Text**:
- Unique approach: Derives ideas from texts, not a particular critical school


#### Mimetic theory: Literature as critical analysis of desire and social mediation

**Girard's Approach to Literature as Theory**

**Principles of Girard's Critical Practice:**
1. **Literary work reveals significant structures or forms of human comportment, on par with human sciences**
2. **Dynamic and essential relation between author and work**
3. **Literary theory and cultural theory are one**

**Mimetic Theory:**
- All cultural transmission is a product of imitation
- Imitative or mimetic desire: desire that is never fully one's own
  - Desire based on another person, not the self or object
  - Mediation between imitator and model

**Types of Mediation:**
1. **External:** Model lies outside realm of imitator (traditional societies)
   - Minimizes possibility for rivalry
2. **Internal:** Relations within a given sphere, can give rise to conflict (modern societies)
   - Mediator both model and obstacle to desire

**Impact of Individualism on Imitation:**
- Modern societies: imitation more widespread and pervasive
  - Institutionalized types of imitation hidden or disavowed
  - Originality perceived as positive, imitation negative (Enlightenment concept)
    * Romantic subject: heroic individuality counterposes to indistinct mass.


#### Analyzing human desire and its relation to individualism through the lens of mimetic theory, with a focus on Girard's critique of Freud and Sartre.

**Girard's Perspective on Romantic Heroes and Antiheroes**

**Romantic Hero vs. Post-Romantic Antihero**:
- Romantic hero fails to halt the march towards social leveling
- Post-Romantic antihero (Flaubert, Dostoevsky) retains the same dialectic between self and other, individual and social

**Individualism as a Religious Form of Anti-Religion**:
- "Secularization" of modern world does not abandon religious structures
- Search for individuality reveals itself as replacement of God by the human subject
- Specter of the Other reveals itself as unwelcome

**Girard's Approach vs. Other Thinkers**:
- Differs from Levinas and Habermas in aiming to discover true nature of human interaction, not found an ethics or politics
- Sees mimetic desire as always opening towards the Other

**Mimetic Theory and Psychoanalysis**:
- Freud's use of myth (Oedipus complex, Narcissus) intriguing from perspective of desire
- Criticizes Freud for not seeing essential role of imitation in Oedipal paradigm
- Sees fatal flaw of psychoanalysis as inability to overcome solipsism

**Girard's Interpretation of Sartre**:
- Sartre's antihero is a hero in disguise, claiming to be the only authentic being
- Anti-Superego is a super-Superego that increases demands of a Superego
- Existentialism is a rejection of bourgeois individualism in the name of more extreme individualism


#### Exploring self-deception in literature: Girard on narcissism and author intentionality.

**Girard's Perspective on Deception and Mimetic Desire**

**Deconstruction of Freud's Narcissism Concept**:
- Proust's work reveals that one can be both self-oriented and other-oriented
- Narcissist's self-desire is a mimetic device to attract desire, not a psychological condition
- Narcissism is a strategy to confirm superiority and increase prestige

**Author and Text**:
- Girard places emphasis on the figure of the author
- Rejects both formalist reduction and overestimation of the author in literary history
- Interested in the evolution of an author's thinking over time
- Reads later works as interpretative keys to earlier works
- Sees symbiotic and existential relationship between author and fictional hero

**Novelistic Conversion**:
- Moments of disillusion where protagonist realizes futility of mimetic pursuits
- Revealed in Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past" as a double denouement


#### Exploring literary conversion through desire and deconstruction in literature.

**Literary Conversions and Mimetics:** Rene Girard's Perspective

**The Creative Process and Self-Deception**:
- The creative process enables authors to discover their own self-deception
- This allows for a novelist to rectify the illusions of the hero and gain creative energy for writing
- Without the experience of self-deception, no conversion or liberation from self-deception is possible

**Literary Conversions: Not All Are Novelistic**:
- Racine's "Phedre" is an example of a work of conversion in his drama
- Reveals the truth about desire and its enslavement to power
- Places Racine before a spiritual choice

**Conversion, Religion, and Renunciation**:
- The term "conversion" has religious connotations
- Represents an opening to religion, leading from literature to Christianity
- Recognition of the failure of desire and self-fulfillment through desire is a renunciation of the world

**Text and Interpretation: Girard vs. Deconstruction**:
- In the 1970s and 1980s, Girard distanced himself from theory in literary studies
- Seeking to reverse his initial enthusiasm for critical avant-garde
- Differences between mimetic theory and deconstruction, but some commonalities

**Girard's Hermeneutic Stance**:
- Refuses the transcendental authority of the author
- Rejects abstract theorizing, preferring to develop insights through careful reading of texts
- Seeks to subvert conventional readings and expose presuppositions

**The Signified and Referent**:
- Deconstruction asserts the autonomy of the text (free play of signifier)
- Cuts off referent-signified, seeing it as produced rather than reflected
- Girard sees deconstruction as a variant of New Criticism, an evacuation of content in favor of linguistic play

**Girard's Approach vs. Deconstruction**:
- Girard's approach is more radical, deconstructing subjectivity through dialectic of desire (Self and Other)
- Can be considered more radical than deconstructive readings, as it takes the text at face value
- Criticized for being inimical to aesthetic aspirations of literature, but not opposed to rhetorical or stylistic analysis

**Classical Aesthetics**:
- Earliest examples of literary criticism connected poetic creation with human nature, psychology, religion, and medicine
- Girard exemplifies this classical approach in a modern context


### 1. History in Saint-John Perse [1953]

**Saint-John Perse's Use of History in Poetry (1953)**

**Historical Presence in Perse's Work**:
- Critics have observed that Perse's works engage with history, an area often scorned by contemporary poets
- Paul Valery and André Breton agreed on Perse's qualities despite their differing poetic perspectives
- Some critics questioned the lasting power of Perse's "pure delight"

**Perse's Approach to History**:
- Does not write "historical poems" with specific events as subjects
- History provides a "form" or "essence" that is affected by it
- Uses historical or legendary images and metaphors to create "anti-images" that cast shadows on the present

**Examples of Perse's Use of Historical Images**:
1. **Bird of Pink Ash**: An American bird compared to a medieval one, inheriting the mystery and anguish of the past
2. **Pluies**: References to Assyria, Carthage, Mexico, Rome, and the French Revolution, with the present playing a "meager role"
3. The "obfuscating function" of these images does not act on the historical past but on other images within the poem

**Conclusion**:
- Perse's use of history in poetry is not limited to giving the present an aura of the past for transfiguration, but also creating a complex relationship between the past and the present.


#### Perspective shift: Perse's universalist and pluralistic approach to history and literature.

**Perse's Oeuvre: From Exoticism to Pluralism**

**Background:**
- Perse's images reflect a clash of worlds previously unseen together
- Not necessary to distinguish what he annexes in space from what he annexes in time
- Universalist and planetary character fundamental to his art

**Exoticism vs. Pluralism:**
- Shift from exoticism to pluralism first triumphed in the sciences of man
- Discovery that each civilization is unique, with no absolute human destiny
- Historical relativism can be an ally for the poet and artist

**Perse's Oeuvre:**
- Reopening of doors to the past at a time when everything becomes enveloped in darkness again
- Negation of Hegelian history that promised eternity
- Finding beauty in forgotten worlds, not limiting himself to historical relativity

**Images in Perse's Oeuvre:**
- Arbitrary with respect to a worldview they negate
- Chaos as their only truth
- Negation of images offers the possibility of discovering underlying rules and organization through analysis.

**Perse's Imagery:**
- Not surprising due to its strangeness but by its exactitude
- Rigorous adherence to objects described, such as falling rain.


#### Poem analyzing Perse's use of imagery and rhythm in "Pluies" for unity and meaning.

**Saint-John Perse's Poetry: Elements of Homogeneity**

**Description of Rain**:
- Rain is described as "feather-helmeted, high-girded, spurred with silver and crystal"
- Heard as its "stamping" (pietinement)
- Seen falling straight and heavy like sharpened points
- Associated with "sheaves" (faisceaux) and "harvest" (moisson)

**Association of Nature and Man**:
- Perse often associates man with natural objects or chemical elements, showcasing the "inhuman" in nature: "Nitre and Nitron are themes of exile"
- Suggests an order by which the chaos of historical images will be arranged

**Logical Apparatus**:
- Intended to "consolidate the enumerations or, if you like, insidiously guarantee their well-being"
- Phrase "nor would I forget..." in Pluies is used to suggest logical correspondence between diverse elements

**Use of Disjunctive and Conjunctive Terms**:
- Suggest that the diverse elements logically correspond to one another: "and ... , or ... , mais ..."

**Manipulation of Verb Tenses**:
- Always reflects the exigencies of the poem's duration
- Shift from past to future is always rational with respect to a present in the middle of the rainy season

**Repetition of Sounds**:
- Repetition of sounds in words with different meanings adds to the poetic effect
- Suggests an ultimate unity or "absolute" behind the relativity of the images

**Ritualistic and Magical Aspects**:
- The shifting between original and secondary meaning creates a "ritualistic" and "incantatory" effect
- Many human gestures described derive from civilizations other than our own, becoming absurd when disconnected from their absolute values


### 2. Valery and Stendhal

**Valery's Perspective on Stendhal: A Comparison**

**Stendhal as a Contradiction**
- Belief in two Egos: natural (true) and social (mask)
- Natural Ego can only be known through instinctive reactions
- Stendhal's assertions of revealing innermost self are questioned
- Literary egotism is based on being more natural than one's nature
- Substitution of imaginary character for the self

**Valery vs. Stendhal: Differences**
- Stendhal sought attention from contemporaries and posterity
- Interested in business, politics; Valery kept silent
- Varying approaches to love and eroticism
- Different perspectives on being sensitive/passionate
- Writing styles and attitudes towards art

**Monsieur Teste: The Antithesis of Stendhal**
- Invulnerable solitude, coextensive inner world
- Disinterested in making himself noticed
- Contempt for art
- Ordinary appearance

**Valery vs. Stendhal: Similarities**
- Both focused on individualism and self-expression
- Valery's Teste and Stendhal's egotism as opposing halves of the object, with a direct relationship.

**Modern Thought Currents**
- Positivist psychologists' enthusiasm for Stendhal questioned
- Differences between Stendhal and Valery reflected in two major currents: one focused on science (Valery) and the other on the primacy of the pure Ego (Valery).


#### The ambiguity of individualist systems: Valery and Stendhal's Egos and the illusion of superiority.

**Valery and Stendhal's Individualist Systems**

**Common Trait**:
- Both have a "habit of the mind which consists in seeing the 'vague things' as identically worthless"
- Importance lies in eliminating ambiguous relations between subject, world, and others to achieve true subjectivity

**Individual Egos**:
- Social Ego: Belongs to everyone, difficult to conceive as free
- Natural Ego: Indomitable force, cannot tolerate limitation of another pure Ego
- Individualist is interested in only one subjectivity - their own
- Debases all others to lift their own higher
- Abstract pattern of two Egos is a trap to ensnare the subjectivity of the other
- Others have only the inferior Ego, creator is in possession of superior Ego
- Pride comes from comparing one's unique Ego with the inferior Ego reproduced in an infinite number of copies

**Pride and Subjectivity**:
- Pure Ego does not suspect existence of others, but communicates a revelation beyond its weak powers
- Prideful subjectivity defies the system it posits by requiring simultaneous presence of two Egos

**Valery's Narrator in Monsieur Teste**:
- More extraordinary than the hero, reflects true light but also has mundane concerns
- In Stendhal's works, social Ego reveals author's issues while natural Ego expresses surprise at such problems

**Arbitrary Nature of Individualist Systems**:
- Creator is both judge and judged, creates obstacles they have not overcome
- Vulnerable to critique from outside observer
- Valery's distinction between being and seeming is equally arbitrary as Stendhal's distinction


#### Comparing Stendhal and Valery's interpretations of literature and individualism.

**Valery vs. Stendhal: A Comparative Analysis**

**Stendhal**:
- Seeks to establish himself as a passionate individual, but his Ego is not truly free
- Wanted to present truth through his work, but did not admit that the only truth lies in the created piece
- Identical consequences from this attitude: Stendhal's Ego is not a free one, and he cannot be held responsible

**Valery**:
- Refuses to be anything specific, including an author or critic
- Believes in the refusal of highly determinate beings, which remains just as determinate
- Rejects objective value in literary criticism, considering it only a way to rehash ideas
- Sees Stendhal's work as lacking substance despite the presence of decor and historical context
- Judges Stendhal's work based on outdated values and prejudices
- Attempts to link Stendhal with insignificant writers, like Voltaire, for effect

**Commonalities**:
- Both authors had a strong sense of individualism
- Their refusal to conform to societal norms led them in different directions: Stendhal embraced passion while Valery rejected labels

**Valery's Approach**:
- Takes liberties with Stendhal's work, considering him outside historical context
- Judges Stendhal based on ahistorical values and beliefs
- Enumerates advantages of associating Stendhal with less significant writers

**Stendhal vs. Valery**:
- Stendhal was passionate but not truly free; Valery refuses labels and maintains an insulated Ego
- Stendhal's work is judged based on outdated values while Valery presents himself as a contemporary critic.


#### Valery's complex relationship with Stendhal: exploring literary influences and identities.

**Stendhal and Valery: An Intellectual Comedy**

**Valery's Critique of Stendhal**:
- Not provoked by Stendhal's defilement of literary idols, but by the confidence placed in causal reasoning that requires appearance of capriciousness
- Recognizes a "precious but dreaded quality" in Stendhal's work and his own early interest
- Stendhal's works revealed the secret workings of the human mind, which Valery had to uncover to create his hero, Monsieur Teste
- Valery's critique may not confirm or deny his earlier stance on Stendhal, leaving the relationship ambiguous

**Monsieur Teste**:
- A character that emerged from Valery's intellectual comedy with Stendhal
- Remains present in Valery's work but plays a complex role as adversary, accomplice, supreme judge, or accused

**Valery's Relationship to Stendhal and Monsieur Teste**:
- Valery never disassociates himself from his writings, but subtly frustrates those who would use them against him
- Any rapprochement between Stendhal and Valery can only happen in the realm of art, where laws no longer apply
- Valery asserts that the true Stendhal is "too radically himself to be reducible to a writer"

**Valery's Critique of His Own Critique**:
- Questions the value of his own critical instrument, suggesting that psychological discoveries are secondary truths
- Blames Stendhal for indulging in discoveries that Valery's criticism is designed to stimulate


### 3. Classicism and Voltaire's  Historiography [1958]

**Voltaire's Historiography and Classicism**

**Background:**

- Voltaire's universal interests prevented him from being solely focused on history
- The honnete homme depends on sound historical choice and the law of classical proportion
- Classical rules enable interest in all things while maintaining self-restraint

**Classical Society and Intellectual Communication:**
- Classical society values the individual and provides maximum intellectual communication
- Greets diverse geniuses with equal alacrity, fostering new forms and ideas

- Extreme subjectivism vs. extreme objectivism
- Voltaire considered both modern attitudes as superficial

**The Price of Abandoning Classical Self-Restraint:**
- Specialization, fragmentation in intellectual life
- Analytical reader personality, mutilated and "specialized"

### 4. Pride and Passion in the  Contemporary NoveP [1959]

**Romanticism and Pride in Literature**

**The Romantic Love Myth**
- Romantic literature emphasized self-glorification through love and passion
- Women's roles were passive and submissive, often used to justify the male protagonist's identity
- Later romantic writers celebrated sex over love as a means of self-justification

**The Evolution of Romantic Characters**
- Real women began losing femininity, while fictional women became more fragile and gracile
- Celebration of passive, self-sacrificing women sounded increasingly melancholic
- Mythical nature of new literary constructions remained unacknowledged during first half of 20th century

**Don Juan as a Symbol**
- Don Juan, an iconic seducer from Spanish Golden Age, persisted in modern literature
- Modern heroes like Monsieur Jean publicized their promiscuity for all to see
- Both heroes aimed to deceive, but with different intentions: Don Juan hid identity, while Monsieur Jean sought self-affirmation through the mask of Don Juan.

**The Egotist and Indifference**
- Modern egotists believe they are invulnerable like gods
- Encountering indifferent women threatens their confidence as they suspect she may also want to be God
- Wearing the mask of Don Juan allows modern seducers to fascinate their partners before being fascinated themselves.


#### Exploring modern erotic relationships, egotistical desire and its disillusionment in literature.

**Dandyism and Modern Erotic Relationships**

**The Dandy**:
- Descended from aristocratic past, but more a product of democracy
- Displays indifference to attract others' attention
- Capitalizes on desires of others, not noble or aristocratic in nature
- Indifference is now advertised more brazenly and impudently

**Modern Erotic Relationships vs. Classical Novels**:
- Modern relationships are a battle of equal, identical selves trying to outdo each other in callousness and insensitivity
- Lacks the refinement and restraint found in classical novels like those of Stendhal or Proust
- Erotic relationship has turned into a display of mutual contempt and desire for autonomy

**The Law of Roger Vailland**:
- A caricature of Hegel's "dialectics of the master and the slave"
- Each partner stakes their freedom against the other, with power of dissimulation as the deciding factor
- The game resembles a child's game in Southern Italy, where the winner is even more of a dupe than the loser

**Modern Novels vs. Classical Literature**:
- Modern novels fail to individualize characters, leaving an impression of uniformity and rigidity
- Characters are trapped in a "Racinian fatality" of unrequited love
- The spiritual disease of narcissism has spread from the elite to the middle class

**The Fall by Albert Camus**:
- Features a hero, Clamence, who was once a successful lover and social advocate
- After being dumped, Clamence turns to self-examination and finds his egotism at the root of his desire for justification
- The Fall is a critique of post-war literature's naive exaltation of individualism and desire, showing them to be symptoms of a deeper spiritual malaise.

**Discovery of Tocqueville's "Democracy in America":
- Stendhal was intrigued by Tocqueville's work on America
- Found the work more favorable than his initial views

**Stendhal vs. Tocqueville**:
- Differences in temperament and style, not substance
- Both viewed America as a paradise of the common man
- Stendhal was more critical of the European intellectual settling in America
- Stendhal identified with his own good, while Tocqueville identified with the common good
- Stendhal's political extremism was a way to challenge "la sottise" (the foolishness) of society

**Stendhal's Critique of Tocqueville**:
- Suspected Tocqueville's work was tendentious, as he was on an official mission to investigate the penitentiary system
- Saw Tocqueville as a product of the "age of cant" and a promising politician under the July monarchy
- Felt Stendhal himself would be more sincere in his opinions

**Similarities Between Stendhal and Tocqueville**:
- Both passionate observers with different perspectives on America
- Shared an appreciation for the paradise of the common man
- Challenged societal norms through their works


#### Comparing aristocratic and modern concepts of freedom in Tocqueville and Stendhal

**Tocqueville's Perspective on Freedom and Equality:**
* Two ideas of freedom: modern (universal, abstract) vs aristocratic (individual, selfish)
* Aristocratic idea increases egotistical energy and passion
* Individuals become capable of extraordinary actions
* Similarities between Tocqueville and Stendhal's views on vanite and democracy

**Aristocratic Freedom:**
* Flourishes in weaker societies
* Greater effect on resentment among commoners
* Inequality decreases economically but increases socially
* Obsession with each other's standing
* Aristocracy becomes corrupt and vulgar

**The French Revolution:**

#### Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past": Snobs vs. Combray and the quest for enchantment and self-divinization.

**Proust's Perspective on Social Hierarchies: The Illusion of the Sacred and the Enchanted Garden**

**Marcel's Exclusion from the Salons**:
- Marcel feels systematically excluded from pleasures considered forbidden by the "snobs"
- This creates an illusion of the sacred, as if the salon is a sacred little world separate from reality
- The rejected outsider feels like a victim of "earthly and mundane damnation"

**The Snobs' Perspective on the Salons**:
- The snobs act as if the salon is a temple of esoteric mysteries, where they are initiates
- They believe imparting these mysteries to unworthy outsiders would dilute and lose them
- The rejected outsider is thus made to feel like a victim of social exclusion

**Combray as an Alternative to the Salons**:
- Combray represents an enchanted garden, unlike the caricatured salons
- Combray has a world of ritual but less self-consciously and rigidly so
- There is perpetual misunderstanding in Combray, but no open conflict
- The narrator lures by the false promise of the salons turns his back on his true goal, the enchanted garden

**The Consequences of Social Hierarchies**:
- The snob cannot find rest even at the "top" of society, as there is always a place where they feel unwanted
- Everyone imagines themselves an outsider, and the snobs deceive and dupe each other by excluding others
- The individual's inner voice tells them they are not a god, but society urges them to arrogate divine functions
- This leads to frustration and the delusion that one is a limited being in a society of demigods

**Marcel's Perspective**:
- Marcel is not prepared to take part in this philosophical debate, possibly because he sees "God's death" as too dead
- The snobs, like Dostoevskian characters, would feel less inadequate if they were less proud and expected the possible from themselves


#### Proust's spiritual conversion through memory and artistic creation

**Proust's Spiritual Conversion and Remembrance of Things Past**

**The Role of Religious Imagery**:
- Proust's religious imagery in Remembrance of Things Past tells a story similar to Dostoevsky's own
- Proust does not perceive the metaphysical or ethical implications, making his analysis more objective and striking

**The Concept of Transcendence**:
- Transcendence once separated worshipper from worshipped
- Now separates individuals from each other, forcing relationships at a corrupt level of religiosity
- Amour-propre (self-centered love) leads to snobisme and sexual passion, pushing the narrator away from Combray

**The Pursuit of Peace**:
- Moments of relief through contemplation of beautiful landscapes or art
- But cannot shut out actuality for long
- The grandmother, Bergotte, and Albertine all die, plunging the narrator into apathy and spiritual emptiness

**The Guermantes Party and Aesthetic Creation**:
- Narrator experiences a sudden blossoming of affective memory at the Guermantes' party
- Uneven cobblestones, starched napkins remind him of his past
- Feels eternal youthfulness in contrast to the decay of the guests
- Resurrected spirit allows for the creation of the great work of art

**The Shift in Direction**:
- The quest for the "enchanted garden" shifts from the outer world to the inner self
- From desire to detachment, possession to contemplation, disintegration to aesthetic creation

**Proust's Unfinished Manuscripts**:
- Critics traditionally believed Remembrance of Things Past was born of a similar revelation
- Recent manuscripts suggest a real break in Proust's aesthetic life and creative process
- Jean Santeuil shows some similarities, but lacks the religious metaphors and deeper understanding found in the finished novel


#### Proust's metaphysical desire, guilt, and the creation of "Remembrance of Things Past"

**Proust's Universal Snobisme in Remembrance of Things Past**

**The Emergence of Universal Snobisme**:
- Proust sees that snobisme is a universal disease, not just limited to society
- He can now assemble all its manifestations into the particular phase he is familiar with
- Jean Santeuil is an ideal figure representing Proust's metaphysical desire
- Proust had not yet reached his mystical goal at the time of writing the novel
- Santeuil represents what Proust hoped to feel following frequentation of salons and imitation of idols

**The Divided World of Jean Santeuil**:
- The world is divided into two halves:
  - Hero's half (good, beautiful, luminous)
  - Enemies' half (dark, ugly, sinister)
- This Manichean division leads to a lack of depth, color, and life
- The hero's half is characterized by an empty and insipid perfection
- The "enemy's" side is characterized by shadowy figures and caricatures

**Reconciling the Two Worlds**:
- Proust wrote essays before Remembrance of Things Past, expressing his conviction that he would never be a great writer
- He perceived mysterious bonds between unrelated people, things, or moments in life
- This somber mood was later attributed to Marcel during the period preceding the aesthetic illumination
- The "conclusion" before Remembrance of Things Past reveals the purely literary aspects of the "dark night"

**The Role of Suffering and Guilt**:
- Proust felt intense guilt for his mother's death, feeling responsible for it
- He retreated to a cork-lined room, giving up his social life
- He insisted that a great vision must be born in suffering
- Guilt feelings, suffering, and remorse are important factors in the spiritual metamorphosis of the writer

**The Price of Reconciliation**:
- Marcel Proust must recognize himself among the snobs to bring together the two worlds of Jean Santeuil
- This is both a "sickness unto death" and a resurrection, ending his metaphysical questing and enslavement

**The Novel's Spiritual Autobiography**:
- The novel reveals a spiritual autobiography that is more beautiful and truer than the literal one
- The novel should be read twice to appreciate the convergence of perspectives


### 8. Marivaudage, Hypocrisy, and  Bad Faith [1963]

**Marivaux's World: Understanding the Complexities of Amour-propre**

**Background:**
- Most people view Marivaux as a playwright who provides a complacent picture of his society and focuses on charm in his leading actresses.
- His plays are often staged, but his novels and essays are less known.

**The Three Faces of Marivaux**:
1. The Playwright: Known for charming plays with ingenues as heroines.
2. The Novelist: Less well-known than the playwright, but important works like "La vie de Marianne" are considered significant.
3. The Essayist: Writes essays on amour-propre (self-love) and vanite (self-absorption), revealing a darker side to his work.

**Marivaux's Perspective on Love**:
- In the plays, physical possession is intertwined with amour-propre (self-love).
- The coquette is not genuinely sensuous but uses make-believe to maintain her lover's attention.
- Amour-propre leads to self-deception and hypocrisy.

**Hypocrisy**:
- Marivaux's essays discuss hypocrisy as a process of self-deception, which is often overlooked in his work.
- The true nature of sentiments based on egotism is evident through the absence of genuine tenderness and the prevalence of pique (resentment).

**The Marivaudian Psyche**:
- Divided between a servant and a master, deceiver and deceived.
- Every coquette has two women in one: one who uses feminine tricks to attract admirers and another who denies them.
- This division recalls the modern concept of unconscious vs. consciousness but is less rigid and complete.

**The Collusion Within**:
- The deceiver and the deceived have a collusive relationship, shifting roles swiftly without being perceived by the subject.
- Masters and servants act as silent accomplices in their teasing and testing of each other.


#### Exploring self-deceit and moral ambiguity in Marivaux's society and psyche.

**Marivaux's Society and Psyche: Self-Deceit and Mitigated Good Faith**

**Characteristics of Marivaudian Society:**
- Duality within unity
- Back and forth motion between poles
- Universal self-deceit for worldly success
- Example of Paris shopkeepers: compromise between good faith and greed

**Marivaux's Literature:**
- Focus on psychological observations
- Mitigated good faith as a state of lukewarmness
- Rejection of rationalist and depth psychology
- Attempt to reveal half-conscious self-delusion from the subjective perspective

**Examples of Marivaudian Characters:**
- Coquette: wants to be virtuous and enjoy pleasures of coquetterie, lands in the middle
- Paris shopkeepers: want to be respectable and rich, choose mitigated good faith

**Mitigated Good Faith:**
- Moral ambiguity evaded by employing self-deceit
- Recalls Sartre's "bad faith" but limited to psychological observation
- Universal phenomenon that tends to have ontological significance
- Accounts for moral responsibility and lack of clear awareness of motivations

**Marivaux vs. Sartre:**
- Both seek moral responsibility while acknowledging complex reality
- Reject complete transparency or opacity for an intermediate chiaroscuro
- Attempts to reveal half-conscious self-delusion at the moment it occurs

**Marivaux's Novels and Plays:**
- Test reader's psychological acumen through subjective technique
- Failure to fully understand due to lack of understanding of essays.


#### Marivaux's ambiguous heroine: Marianne, the cunning hypocrite.

**Marivaux's Novel "Marianne"**

**Plot Summary**:
- Marianne, an innocent young girl, is advised by her landlady Mme Dutour to accept gifts from the old man she is protecting (Climal) in order to keep him at bay.
- Marianne initially rejects this immoral advice, but later accepts the clothes and presents.
- When Valville, a young, rich, and elegant suitor declares his love, Marianne rushes to the priest to expose Climal's deceitful intentions.
- The story is ambiguous as it is told from Marianne's perspective, who portrays herself as an innocent victim.

**Marivaux's Perspective**:
- Marivaux does not endorse the immoral or amoral behavior of his characters, but rather explores the societal context that allows such behavior to flourish.
- His novels feature characters like Marianne and Jacob, who are successful despite their "mitigated good faith."
- Marivaux's disapproval of these characters is implicit in the stories, not explicitly stated.

**Marianne as a Character**:
- Despite her innocent demeanor, Marianne engages in hypocritical behavior, deceiving both Climal and the priest.
- Her self-righteousness allows her to escape criticism for her actions.
- The reader is left to question the true intentions of the seemingly innocent Marianne.

**Marivaux's Use of Moliere**:
- Marivaux's novel "Marianne" features a reversal of the theme from Moliere's "Tartuffe."
- Like Tartuffe, the character Climal is vulnerable to the charms of a deceptive woman.
- Marianne's ability to manipulate both Climal and the priest reflects Marivaux's critique of societal values.


### 9. Formalism and Structuralism in  Literature and the Human Sciences [1963]

**Formalism and Structuralism in Literature and the Human Sciences**

**Positive Contributions of Positivism**:
- Editing and critiquing literary texts
- Amassing historical knowledge about literature

**Reaction against Positivism**:
- Dismissal of scientific dogma as "sad"
- Affirmation of the primacy of the work over external influences

**The "Copernican Revolution" in Literary Criticism**:
- Interpreting and analyzing works of literature, rather than their environment
- Rejecting reductionist approaches that negate the specificity of the literary text

**The Concept of Structure in Linguistics and the Human Sciences**:
- Structural linguistics as an autonomous entity with internal dependencies
- Structural analysis reduces objects to a network of relations

**Structuralism in Literary Studies**:
- Generalization of the term "structure" after World War II
- Recognition that structuralism is a larger scientific movement, not isolated to literature

**Challenges and Misconceptions about Structuralism**:
- Concerns about reductionist criticism
- Structuralism eliminates univocal causal relations and metaphysical entities


#### Exploring the complex relationship between art, meaning, and structure in criticism.

**Structuralism and Formalism**

**Relationship between Disciplines**:
- No longer turf battles at operational level
- Structures and structures of structures (worlds/worldviews)
- Reciprocal expression, no hierarchy, not implying solution or origins

**Literary Criticism**:
- Significance vs. reductionism
- Meaningful structural field
- Literary work signifies differently than other structures
- Avoiding mistrusted "depth psychologies"
- Immediate vs. mediated structure/form
- Desire for language free from extra-aesthetic meanings

**Formalism**:
- Detaches form from meaning
- Transforms "return to artwork" into isolationism
- Opposition of aesthetic structure from other meaningful structures
- Dualism of form and content, ethics of non-commitment
- Old opposition between realism/art for art's sake or naturalism/symbolism

**Content vs. Form**:
- Thing-oriented positivist conception of both content and form
- Dominance of formalism by positivism
- Extreme distrust of meaningful structures

**Psychoanalysis and Philosophy**:
- Useful for drawing out aesthetic structures in criticism focused on the work
- Systems have operative, not normative character


#### Structural description in literature: Balzac, Proust, and the hidden meaning in objects.

**Interpretative Criticism vs Structural Analysis**

**Characteristics of Interpretative Criticism:**
- Not systematic or philosophically consistent
- Focuses on uncovering hidden philosophical frameworks in works, sometimes loosely related to the text
- Transforms systems into an interplay of structural grids
- May be seen as revolutionary, turning literature upside down

**Balzac's Description and Structural Analysis:**
- Description not a simple inventory but a circular process
- Reveals reciprocal conditioning between parts and whole
- Objects describe larger meaning in the context of the whole work

**Proust's Combray as a Model of Structural Description:**
- Not geography that interests the novelist, but the depiction of structures
- Description composed of objects but indirect and symbolic
- Focus on enclosed spaces, human warmth, security, ignorance, mistrust of new things

**Properties of Structures:**
- Resistance to change
- Upsetting relation between whole and parts by introducing a new element can lead to radical change or explosion of worldview

**Combray's "Worldview":**
- Inhabitants reject unfamiliar information that challenges the existing structure
- The essential, principle of unity, is not directly perceivable by outsiders
- Misunderstandings between Combray and external world are similar in nature

**Limitations of Positive Observation:**
- Plain observer lacks the principle of unity that organizes objects into a signifying totality
- Information gleaned through positive observation is perceived from the outside, labeled as "prejudiced"

**Understanding Combray's Secrets:**
- Initiation required to perceive the structure, not directly definable.


#### Exploring the interplay of structure and interiority in literature and anthropology.

**The Relationship Between Novelists, Literary Criticism, and Structuralism**

**Background:**
- Novelist's predicament similar to that of literary critic facing work
- Description of structure is essential for reader "initiation"
- Poetic element relies on interiority, which can only apprehend itself metaphorically

**Metaphors in Proust's Work:**
- Derives from areas of inquiry conquered by structuralism: ethnology, sociology, psychopathology, history of religion, etc.
- Examples: Aunt Leonie's nightstand becomes a church altar; analysis of Australian customs compared to Parisian society

**Openness and Inclusion:**
- No domain of reality should be excluded for fear of losing poetry richness
- Proust articulates closure of Combray by opening himself to various areas of human history

**Structuralism in Literature and Sciences:**
- Structural disciplines adopt problems, style of interpretation from novelistic works (e.g., Levi-Strauss's analysis of Australian customs)
- Criticism of structuralism comes from those who note literary style (e.g., Jacques Lacan)

**The Experience of the Structuralist:**
- Perception of structures requires connection between exteriority and interiority
- Exteriority gives whole but not parts; interiority gets lost in details
- Paradoxical that one must connect exteriority with interiority to perceive structure.


#### Exploring Structuralism through Proust: The Journey Beyond Structures and Self-Discovery

**The Challenge of Perceiving Structures:**
* Ethnologist's patience tested: between understanding 'savages' vs self-perception (1)

### 10. Racine, Poet of Glory [1964]

**Racine's Approach to Metaphors: A Poetic Operation**

**Metaphorical Process**:
- From birth to death, metaphor undergoes a single continuous process
- Original semantic field gradually falls away, becoming fully arbitrary
- Lost its mediating function as a metaphor
- Racine invites metaphors to rediscover their mediating function

**Racine's Technique: Play on Words and Rhetoric of Precocity**
- Example from "Andromache": "seared by a greater flame than e'er I lit"
  - Not an image that arrests attention, but the clever reinsertion back into literal context
  - Pyrrhus sets Troy ablaze; mad lover is a true fire raiser
- Metaphorical relationship between sentimental and social levels in "Iphigenia"
  - Eriphyle is "ravished" by Achilles in every sense
  - Tragedy reveals the synthetic unity of these two domains

**Characteristics of Racine's Profane Tragedies: History, Mythology, and Cult of Emperor**
- Historical and mythological elements intertwined
- Metaphorical meaning of master/slave and god/worshiper relationships
  - Evokes the concrete aspects of glory as well as its fascination
- Imperial omnipotence results in the cult of the emperor in Roman history
- Racinian glory is radiance, the dazzling light reflected on a glorious being
- Desire defined as lack of glory; Berenice's desire drawn to Titus's incomparable glory

**Metaphorical Fusion and Naturalness**:
- Poetic equivalent of historical process
- Fusion of the two domains of metaphor escapes us due to its naturalness.


#### Racine's Poetry: Glory and Desire's Interplay in Sovereign Autonomy and Indifference

**Racinian Desire: Glory and Indifference**

**Glory as a Form of Indifference**
- Narcissus's belief in Junia's indifference to Britannicus
- Indifference as a sign of glory and self-sufficiency
- Glory as the object of desire, not its antithesis
- Desire intensifies with the perception of another's indifference

**Desire and Glory in Racine's Plays**
- Charms prized over high birth, wealth, or position
- Desire nourishes glory and cannot survive without it
- Circle of desire: recognizing someone's superior glory
- Weakness of desire leads to asymmetrical relationships
- Humiliation for one partner, boredom for the other

**Misconceptions about Glory in Racine's Dramas**
- Opportunistic and materialistic appearance of glory
- Elusive, capricious, and paradoxical human relations
- Desire attributed to pride or openness towards another
- Misunderstanding of the nature of desire and glory.

**The Illusion of Self-Understanding in Desire**
- Not based on objective experience but quasi-mystical revelation
- Emphasis on avid gazes (avides regardes) as engendering and perpetuating glory
- Light reflecting on courtiers is itself a reflection of their unanimous desire.


#### Exploring non-reciprocal desire and power dynamics in Racine's tragedies.

**Racine's Tragedies: Glory and Desire**

**Two Roles of Opposition:**
- Consecutive or simultaneous roles: Hermione/Orestes, Racine/Pyrrhus, Andromache/Pyrrhus, Junia/Titus
- Glory vs. desire: master and slave relationship

**Historical Background:**
- Ancient societies' brutal reality vs. rhetoric of precocity
- Hegelian dialectic: master and slave, but not applicable to Racine's dialectic of glory

**Elements of Racine's Art:**
1. Non-reciprocity: formal (rhetorical) vs. real (historical)
2. Glory defines a non-reciprocity more spiritual but no less real than servitude
3. Negation between the two domains of metaphor, but perpetual contamination

**Revealing Essence:**
- Dialectic of desire opposed to social dialectic
- Incomplete separation: misunderstanding and misrecognition of Racinian glory

**Glory vs. Desire:**
1. Two incompatible things that engage and repel each other ceaselessly
2. Glory = desire in Racine's heroes (Titus, Pyrrhus)
3. Cornelian hero: solid ground vs. Racinian hero: frenzied action with a declining milieu
4. Concrete action vs. memory or project
5. Appetite for glory transforms itself when deprived of concrete sustenance

**Racine's Tragedies:**
- Reveal essential meanings without risking synthesis destruction and return to heterogeneous elements
- Play the game of Racinian glory, not treat it as hyperboles of preciosity.


#### Racine's poetry: Glory, desire, individualism, dialectic, intersubjectivity, rivalry, tragedy, emptiness, selfhood, Other

**Competitions and Glory:**
- **King's bonnet**: Antagonisms are more implacable due to trivial objectives
- **Glory metamorphosis**: Permeated with envy, jealousy, and a sexual tinge
- **Vanquished parties**: No longer experience humiliation or envy (dead)
- **Duel disappearance**: Opposed desire in heroine instead of hero
- **Chimena**: Deprived of worthy object, ambition becomes abstract competition
- **Rivalry transformation**: Sexual domain becomes a form of ambition
- **Feminization of Racinian hero**: Honor vs. glory, individualism's degradation
- **One-upmanship consequences**: Results in debacle, even personal dignity succumbs
- **Jansenist theology influence**: Violence in Racine lacks positive role and liberation
- **Racine's works**: Relate to history but transcend particular circumstances
- **Descartes vs. Racine**: Individualism masks radical negation of the Other

**Glory Dialectic:**
- **First moment**: Triumphant glory, not recognized as a dialectic
- **Racinian glory**: Purely rhetorical or ignored due to Cornelian definition
- **Descartes and Corneille**: Describe first stage of dialectic
- **Second moment**: Glory no longer produces happy outcomes
- **Historical context**: Recurring phenomenon in individualistic societies
- **Proust's influence**: Fragmented Racinian "subject" into historical, religious, mythological images and allusions.

**Affirmation of Self:**
- **Individualist choice**: Within concrete framework (intersubjective)
- **Challenge to the Other**: Immediate consequence: implacable rivalry
- **Sovereign grandeur**: Cannot be shared or relinquished.


#### Exploring the dialectics of glory and desire in Phaedra by Racine.

**Racine's Tragedy of Glory: The Dialectic of Desire**

**Sovereign Grandeur**:
- Refusing to share it with the Other leads to perpetual relinquishment and retaking
- The more one forgets the Other, the more scandalous the foreign presence becomes

**Phaedra's Dilemma**:
- Phaedra descends from a race of gods, but her divinity is a duty she cannot shirk without falling into the subhuman
- Her desire for Hippolytus causes her to lose her divinity, revealing a monotheism of the Ego incompatible with the cult of desire
- The greater one's idea of their own glory, the more it is compromised by desire

**The Dialectic of Desire**:
- Phaedra's ancestors represent the world of pride that is overturned into a world of humiliation
- Phaedra transmits her prideful vocation to her children, condemning them to the Pascalian duality of the angel and the beast
- Racinian drama's "tragic functions" reflect the dialectic of desire in the face of a world offering no possibility of authentic existence

**Goldmann's Perspective**:
- The tragic refusal is an attitude of the tragic character facing a world that offers no possibility of authentic existence
- This tragic refusal must be exempt from phenomenal descriptions to fully encompass the trans-phenomenal refusal


#### Exploring Tragic Refusal and Authenticity in Racine's "Berenice" and the ambiguity of creative acts

**Narcissus and Junia's Refusal:**
- **Narcissus**: Tries to trick Britannicus by pretending to be unwilling to conquer, but this is seen as dissimulation or "bad faith" in the world of desire.
- **Junia**: Her refusal to be with the Emperor may be authentic or tactical, making it difficult to distinguish from an objective viewpoint.

**Racine's Interpretation:**
- Racine saw the refusal of the Port-Royal group as a form of coquetry and temptation for the Emperor.
- Narcissus and phenomenology reveal mistrust towards noble attitudes, but this perspective is not unjustified from a tragic point of view.

**Berenice:**
- **Titus**: Bound to Berenice by habit according to Roland Barthes; obstacles to their union are presented as external.
- Barthes' interpretation questions the authenticity of Racine's hero, who may be inauthentic due to the poet's own experiences or intentions.

**Tragic Refusal:**
- Transforms the slave into a master and vice versa; no objective criteria distinguish authentic refusal from its simulacrum.
- The tragic denouement separates true from false, authentic from inauthentic.
- Racine's own religious conversion could be linked to his tragedy of refusal.

**Racine's Later Life:**
- In 1677, Racine responded to the call for ethics within aesthetics by turning towards religion.
- The later Racine may not be as extreme as some interpretations suggest but rather a complex figure with both aesthetic and ethical dimensions.


#### Racine's Tragedies: Desire, Glory, and Negative Attitudes in Ethics and Aesthetics

**Renunciation and Desire in Racine's Tragedies**

**The Shift from Theater to Family Life**:
- Renounces theater and starts a family
- Takes on responsibilities of husband, father, and citizen under Louis XIV
- Rejects ancient wisdom and embraces Old Testament

**Old Testament and Kantian Morality**:
- Predominance of Law revealed
- Kierkegaard places Old Testament and Kantian morality in sphere of ethics
- Extremist Jansenism and Kantian morality as authentic expressions of tragic vision

**Inversion of Worldly Categories**:
- **Pure and simple inversion of earlier worldly categories**
- Ethical man destroys what he loved, making truth into ultimate idol
- Represents a real transcendence of aesthetics

**Kierkegaard's Perspective on Ethics**:
- Able to recognize superiority of ethics despite suffering from it
- Transcending ethics may reduce its hatred

**Ethics as Escape and Refusal**:
- Negative attitudes (renunciation, escape, refusal) are efficacious
- Intensions behind these attitudes are always pure
- Will to renunciation exerts force opposite to force of attraction

**Orestes' Dilemma**:
- Discovers presence within world of desire as a paradoxical consequence of will to escape
- Force that keeps us in circle of desire is always in solidarity with it

**Negative Attitudes and Bad Faith**:
- Negative attitudes flow from bad faith, which speculates on ambiguity not responsible for
- Worldly acts are double, with dynamic perspective revealing spiritual trajectory towards unity

**Figures of First Tragic Refusal**:
- Outside world of desire, cannot penetrate into circle of obsession
- Junia's solitude at Vestals is same as she left behind

**Phaedra: A Being Liberated from Desire and Renunciation**:
- Discovers dark side of glory on deathbed
- Farewell to light also farewell to blasphemous pride


#### Exploring Racine's Phaedra: The Transcendence of Worldly Desire in Tragedy

**Phaedra's Fate and Racine's Works**

**Phaedra as a Bridge**:
- Embodies both the world and the refusal of the world
- Experiences the descent into Hell, blending Greek fate and Christian redemption
- Represents a transition between ancient and Judeo-Christian worlds
- Embodies the transcendence of aesthetics

**Phaedra's Role in Racine's Existence**:
- Unites Racine's works and his existence through Phaedra's fate
- Represents the death of the world of theater, seen as analogous to Greek hubris or modern pride
- Racine defends theater but also sees it as culpable

**Phaedra and Racine's Previous Works**:
- Phaedra's fall is about triumphant desire, in contrast to Racine's earlier works' idealistic tragic refusal
- Phaedra's death represents the death of the world of theater
- Racine recognizes the radical worldliness of theater

**Phaedra and Spiritual Evolution**:
- Phaedra is an example and lesson for Racine, helping him transcend "distractions and miseries"
- The preface to Phaedra suggests one can achieve ethical transcendence within aesthetics itself
- This perspective is more modern than Aristotelian and has limited influence

**Phaedra's Transition in Racine's Works**:
- Phaedra represents a transition, but the poet cannot fully overcome the division between speech and silence
- Previous works were divided, with a "share" of silence that grows in Phaedra
- Divisions in Racine's works reflect the division of his own soul

**The Theme of the Double**:
- The theme of the double is fundamental in Racine's work
- Racine reinvents this theme, which reflects the division of his own imagination


#### Exploring Racine's Phaedra: Desire, Idolatry, and Mythological Symbolism.

**The Two Dimensions of the Double: Phaedra's Mythical Expression**

**Internal Doubling**:
- Racinian interpretation of the demigod
- Phaedra as a spiritual child of hubris
- Desire for glory and the myth of Prometheus
- Failure of glory to be its own light

**The Double Properly Speaking**:
- Incestuous passion
- The Same becoming Other, the Other becoming the Same
- Dialectic of divine irony and non-reciprocal desire

**Mythological Background**:
- Phaedra as a dehumanized, mechanized existence
- Inability to distinguish relative from absolute

**Understanding Racine's Renunciation of Profane Tragedy**:
- Metaphorical relation between myth and contemporary experience
- Marxism and psychoanalysis: denouncing non-reciprocity in human relationships
- Barthes: magical saturation of everyday life

**Racine's Formative Procedures**:
- Revealing the meaning of myth through formal poetic game
- Transcending aesthetics towards spiritual choice

**The Poetic Game and Its Significance**:
- Insight into the dialectic of desire that leads beyond aesthetics
- Alliterative sound conveying exorbitant, obsessed feeling
- Criticism associated with Marxism and psychoanalysis uncovers meaning.


### 11. Monsters and Demigods in Hugo  [1965]

**The Man Who Laughs (L'homme qui rit) by Victor Hugo**

**Gwynplaine**:
- Artificial monster, victim of comprachicos (makers of buffoons and dwarfs)
- Disfigured face with perpetual grin, but soul remains generous and good
- Opposed to elegant, wealthy, and beautiful, yet cruel, indifferent, and immoral Lord David and Duchess Josiane

**Inverted Association of Beauty and Goodness**:
- Physical ugliness associated with moral uglieness, serving as a foil for the twofold beauty of Gwynplaine
- This inversion challenges the usual association between beauty and goodness

**Monsters and Demigods**:
- **Ursus** and his pet wolf **Homo**: More human than man, less bestial
- **Light/obscurity inverted**: Only the blind Dea can see Gwynplaine's true self

**Early Works**:
- Characters like Habibrah and Han of Iceland: Physical ugliness associated with moral uglieness
- Opposes "honest" monstrosity of brute to hidden monstrosity of judges, priests, and government officials

**Quasimodo (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)**:
- Victim of moral comprachicos: Surrounded by old bigots ready to pounce
- Innocent victim, scapegoat for cruel and superstitious society
- Redemptive mission elevates him in the eyes of the reader

**Gwynplaine's Misfortunes**:
- First failure caused by comprachicos, not responsible
- Second failure caused by desire, responsible
- Sudden revelation of high birth destroys his humble happiness with Ursus and Dea


#### Exploring Hugo's identification with monstrosity: Pride, failure, and desire.

**Themes in Victor Hugo's "The Man Who Laughs"**

**Symbolism of Disfigurement**:
- Human relationships symbolized by disfigurement
- Rehabilitation of the monster is a process of identification with the victim
- Identification with Gwynplaine defines a "masochistic" moment in Hugo's consciousness

**Identification with the Monster (Gwynplaine) and God (Lord David)**:
- Pride leads to failure and disfigurement
- Failure becomes monstrosity, an obstacle that cannot be overcome
- Identification with the monster preceded by a "sadistic" moment of proud exaltation and identification with Lord David
- The failed god attempts to divinize the monster they have created

**Metaphysical Poetry**:
- Identification with the monster (Gwynplaine) defines the "masochistic" and "revolutionary" feeling in Hugo's metaphysical poetry
- The poetic fall into darkness and formlessness is akin to Satan's fall from grace
- Identification with Satan, the pariah prince of deformed and formless beings

**Primal Imagery**:
- Inversion of primal images in "The Man Who Laughs" and metaphysical poetry
- Turned toward God or Satan depending on the interpretation.


#### Exploring Hugo's complex relationship with Satan through "The Toad" poem.

**Hugo's Satanism: An Existential Analysis**

**Background:**
- Hugo justifies own revolt against tradition through fixation on Satan
- Critics and psychoanalysts have not fully revealed this analogy between Satan and Hugo

**Gwynplaine's Flaw:**
- Desire for the beautiful Josiane and fascination with Lord David
- Denounces them but remains captive to their influence

**Satanism in Hugo:**
- Not a break with traditions, but an incomplete nature of this break
- Respects what he attacks and attacks what he respects
- Rebellion and ambiguity characterize rebellion

**The Gothic:**
- Opposed to neoclassical concept of beauty
- Flamboyant and gargoyle represent the true gothic
- God enters gothic only after exorcising last spells of neoclassicism

**Treatment of Animals in Hugo's Late Poetry:**
- Toad, another Gwynplaine or Satan
- Condemned then rehabilitated beyond measure
- Torturers belong to human groups closest to angelic condition
- Opposes bestial angels to angelic beast
- No bounds to Hugo's enthusiasm for the donkey

**Hugo's True Genius:**
- Exaggeration of black and white, abyss and summit
- Monsters do not survive in rarefied atmosphere
- Inversion of images remains haunted by the values it contests
- Obscurity exalted as light; praise of blindness made in terms of vision.


### 12. Bastards and the Antihero in Sartre

**Sartre's The Words (Les mots)**

**Impressions of Childhood and Self-Criticism:**
- Impressions of childhood, portrait of a grandfather, self-criticism
- Provides literature but lacks novelty or depth in understanding the unity of themes

**The Project and Psychoanalysis:**
- Rejects static notions of character and personality
- Emphasizes dynamic and revocable project that determines our world
- Importance of exploring one's personal history to understand original choice
- Authentic resurrection of childhood necessary for psychoanalytic exploration
- Involves going outside oneself to objectify consciousness
- Not limited to rough, fragmentary quality but strives for harmony and organic unity in autobiography

**Psychoanalysis and Sartre's The Words:**
- Psychoanalytic inquiry presented as an ordeal (epreuve) that involves disruptions
- Reestablishes continuity amidst rupture, reconciles contraries for intellectual and ideological needs
- Allows change but not too much, ultimately leading to the conjuring away of the meaning of psychoanalysis

**Revision of Old Theoretical Frameworks:**
- Old theoretical frameworks reflect illusions and ignorance that analysis can rid us of
- Elements of the system need to be revised step by step in light of new understandings

**The Fall (La chute) and Systematic Thinking:**
- Camus reversed himself in The Fall, a masterwork misunderstood for being dominated by systematic thinking
- Today, we accuse systematic thinking of desecrating works that were once deplored for being dominated by it
- Who is showing ideological rigidity in this debate? Who is succumbing to the power of anti-humanist jargon?

**Sartre's Obsession with His Past:**
- Criticized for obsessing over his past to perpetuate reputation as an enfant terrible.


#### Exploring Sartre's project of being god and the role of the Other in his work.

**The Word's Challenge to Criticism**

**Sartre's Exploration**:
- The Word keenly whets our appetite for meaning but leaves us unsatisfied
- Sartre hesitates before the extreme consequences of his own discoveries
- The challenge is to push the confrontation between the two Sartres farther than Sartre himself did
- The Word reveals the structure of Sartre's earlier works, such as **Baudelaire** and **Genet**

**Freud and the Oedipus Complex**:
- The Word recognizes the foundational role that Freud gave to the Oedipus complex
- In **Being and Nothingness**, Sartre's project of being is still conceived on the basis of a subject-object relation
- The Other is absent from this model, so the Oedipus complex cannot play a central role

**Solipsism in Sartre's Thought**:
- The implicit adherence to Cartesian tradition eliminates the Other from the project
- To fully understand the Oedipus complex in Sartrean language, we must see the project as an original relation to the **Other**, not just the object
- Sartre's work reveals the solipsism of classical philosophy and his own work

**Transcending Solipsism**:
- Sartre must transcend this solipsism, as it is present in all his philosophical thought that stems from the **cogito**
- The Freudianism of The Word has nothing academic about it, but is a Freudianism of experience opposed to the solipsism of Being and Nothingness
- The ultimate meaning of the project, according to Being and Nothingness, is the desire to be god

**The Concept of God**:
- God is defined as a projection of the Other
- If God does not belong to the world of human society, it resides in some metaphysical empyrean, outside humanity and the world
- Sartre's concept of god reflects the solitude of the Supreme Being, a victim of Greek philosophy

**Integrating Intersubjectivity**:
- The project of being god is transformed into something infinitely concrete, living, and rich in meaning
- The essential frustration of the **Ego** must be founded on intersubjectivity
- Suffering, joy, and sadness are always the suffering of the Other, not just our own


#### Sartre's analysis of desire, imitation, and Oedipus complex.

**Desire for Being God and The Other**
- **Sartre's analysis**: desire to be god also a desire to be the Other, desire to be this god that is the Other
- **Desire as object relation**: becomes mere object relation when it remains at animal level as need
- **Thirst as example**: thirst for the Other through object associated with them
  - Whisky consumption in existentialist novels: sacralization, obscuring phenomenon
- **Project of being god**: always claims to be aiming for god we already embody, never recognizes aiming for The Other
- **Philosopher and tradition**: succumbs to philosophical tradition due to universal illusion

**Oedipus Complex and Its Consequences**
- **Unity of contradictory project**: based on rigorous logical necessity in Oedipal conflict
- **Father as prohibition**: son attempts to create new desire, threatened by hateful ambivalence
- **Child's freedom**: aspires against father's affective and intellectual tyranny, chooses heroes not approved by grandfather
  - Negative attitude towards Oedipal divinity: initial bifurcation of libido
- **Sublimation**: child believes he is governed by hero, but ultimately brings us closer to subjectivity of the grandfather.

**Imitation and Transcendence**
- **Negation of grandfather**: does not distance from him but brings us closer through imitating his project of being god by way of The Other
- **Conflict development**: deepens imitation, negation not destroying desire but perpetuating it through displacement and reorganization.
- **Desire for hero**: child hopes to live out exploits in reality, reading is not a simple pretext for dreaming.


#### Sartre's journey from heroic illusion to shame and self-affirmation in literature.

**Poetry and Heroism in Sartre's Work**

**Introduction:**
- Poetry is not an essence but a passion turning towards the Other
- Literature as a prelude to heroic acts
- Sartre aligns with the "sword" over the "pen" in the debate between the two

**Heroic Passion and Disillusionment:**
- Heroic being is a false self, revealed through critical reflection
- Shame and humiliation result from unfulfillable heroic dreams
- Child's experience of disillusion with heroic ideal
- Shame deepens self-consciousness and may lead to pride in singularity

**The Repudiated Essentialism:**
- The antiheroic work originates in the mystique of the hero
- Disillusionment results in shame, which can be transformed into pride
- Sartre refers to those who cling to heroic illusion as "bastards" or "salauds"
- Spiritual operation similar to Kierkegaardian despair and Genet's rebirth

**Sartrean Discourse:**
- Sartrean discourse is impregnated with the illusions it denounces
- Heroic lucidity is demonstrated through vilifying and ridiculing oppositions.


#### Exploring Sartre's antihero: Superego, desire, and identity crises

**Sartre and the Superego**

**Background:**
- Psychoanalyst told Sartre he had no Superego
- This proposition is unacceptable based on content of The Words

**The Superego**:
- Not a mere "superstructure" of psyche
- Farther removed from consciousness than Ego
- Always remains in contact with Id
- Hidden behind Ego ideal, identification with father from early childhood
- Appears when libidinal attitude toward original Oedipal object gives way to narcissistic libido
- Represents energetic reaction against early object-choices of Id

**Relationship between Superego and Ego**:
- Not exhausted by precept "You ought to be like this (like your father)"
- Also includes prohibition "You may not be like this"
- Implies renunciation of purely sexual goals, sublimation of heroic ideal

**Cult of Heroes and The Words**:
- Cult of heroes represents Freudian Superego
- Charactistics: religious imitation, rigid moralism, impression of impotence
- Sartre's antihero in The Words can be seen as inverted Superego

**Anti-Superego**:
- More demanding than original Superego
- Exercises more stringent supervision over Ego
- Posits ideal that is always more difficult to attain

**Sartre's Antihero and Psychoanalysis**:
- Renunciation of heroism maintains Oedipal servitude in new form
- Anti-Superego formed from realization of Superego's tyranny
- Inverted Superego exercises control over every aspect of antiheroic works

**Misconceptions about Sartre and the Superego**:
- Psychoanalyst's claim that Sartre had no Superego based on misunderstanding of his work
- Public figure misinterpreted as lacking Superego due to self-criticism and transcendence claims.

**Continuity in Existence**:
- Sartre reconciles self-criticism with unity of work
- Perpetual breakdowns and reorganizations establish continuity within existence.


#### Sartre's self-examination of heroic illusion and antiheroes in literature.

**Suspicion Towards Self-Psychoanalysis in Sartre's Work**

**Reemergence of Critique on Hero in Psychoanalytic Autobiography**:
- Similar to preceding works, a suspicion is cast over self-psychoanalysis
- Sartre is not always eager to dispel this suspicion

**Truth Revealed in "The Words"**:
- Confirms truth of hero and antihero
- Final truth does not negate earlier truths but enriches them
- Truth can be lost, like preceding truths
- Superimposed veils of complex dialectics eliminate brightness of an intense light

**Alienation and Disalienation Process**:
- Twofold process that persists
- Critic can champion final truth by bringing together and opposing texts

**Analysis of "Nausea"**:
- Describes unjustified, brackish existence of fellow creatures and vindicates own
- Roquentin is antihero who does not believe in adventure or courage
- Typical antihero, inversion not brought out into the open

**Contrast between Hero and Antihero**:
- Conquering bourgeois of 19th century as "culture heroes"
- Impetraz statue embodies heroic values
- Roquentin renounces everything except renunciation, dies in world of culture heroes

**Necessity of "Nausea"**:
- Destruction of heroic pretensions of Others through self-suffering
- Consent of the Other lends weight to antihero's disillusionment
- Psychodrama reflecting genesis of antihero and failure of message reception.


#### Sartre's exploration of desire, obstacles, and the divine in Nausea and Being and Nothingness.

**Sartre's Theft of the Bastard: Synthesis of In-itself and For-itself**

**The Object and Its Meaning**
- An object's meaning always refers to the Other; it belongs to the Other.
- Sartre's statue symbolizes the "petrification" of bourgeois values, but also the union between the Other and meaning.
- The metaphors describing the bastard in Nausea denote the viscosity or failure of this synthesis between the In-itself and For-itself.

**Desire and Hatred for the Bastard**
- The hatred toward the bastard is mixed with desire, an Oedipal ambivalence.
- The antihero wants to convey his message to the bastard, either convincing him of shamefulness or maintaining the difference between them.

**The Antihero's Project: Being God**
- The antihero desires to be his own model and embody failure, seeking a desire not mediated by the Other.
- This reveals the "project of being god," which is a retreat from earlier projects that divinized the Other.
- Each modality of the project is more ambitious but also a retreat due to the increasing impotence required for self-realization.

**The Emergence of the God and Obstacle**
- The passive resistance of the inert object and the Other's consciousness tend toward an impossible synthesis that haunts Sartre.
- Desire is a search for the obstacle, as it is a desire for the sacred; the antihero's desire demonstrates this.
- Impetraz and culture heroes are symbols of paternity and embody the Oedipal god, resembling the grandfather in The Words.


#### Exploring desire's relationship with the in-itself and the Other in "Nausea" by Sartre.

**The Concept of Antihero in Sartre's "Nausea"**

**The Literary Nature of The Words**:
- Certain readers reject the authenticity of the twofold portrait as too literary
- This is misconstrued as the antihero divinizing the obstacle, despite being incapable of embodying it

**The Trajectory of Nausea**:
- A loss of meaning and a regression toward chaos
- A kind of deliverance announcing the defeat of false heroes and the triumph of the antihero
- From the bastard to the object, from the object to Roquentin, and from Roquentin to the brute existent

**The Destruction of Illusions**:
- The corrupted and broken objects symbolize the disintegration of the fascinating synthesis that structures this world
- Roquentin's predilection for torn up and stained papers, rotting things
- The attempt at embodiment gives way to an attempt at disembodiment

**The Desire for the Other**:
- The inanity of meaning and the emptiness of the Oedipal divinity proclaimed
- Desire is deceived with respect to its object, always the desire for the Other
- Even the most devoid of intersubjective meanings is permeated with them

**The Separation of Self**:
- The absolute separation of the in-itself from the for-itself and the dualism of being and nothingness
- The in-itself as the Oedipal father, a god without spirit yet superior to philosophical systems
- The for-itself as the antihero, feeling like a nothing before the Oedipal obstacle

**The Role of Inert Objects**:
- Provides a neutral terrain for Roquentin's war against the Others
- Preserves the illusion of absolute autonomy and indifference required by the antihero's mystique
- The antihero aims at the bastard, openly turning toward the obstacle in decisive moments

**The Antihero's Provocative Gaze**:
- Reveals the first effects of the illness that infects the world, accelerating the fatal process
- Deflates reputations and unmasks impostures, leaving no obstacle untouched
- A sense of sight that dominates in "Nausea", as seen in naturalist and Paul Valery's works


### 13. Critical Reflections on Literary  Studies [1966]

**M. Picard's Critique of Literary Studies**

**Background:**
- Quarrel between M. Picard and M. Barthes
- Accusations against M. Barthes for "defaming" Sorbonne in foreign journals
- Reaction from M. Picard in his pamphlet "Nouvelle critique, nouvelle imposture"

**M. Picard's Perspective:**
- Criticism of Barthes and other critics seen as subversive or deviationist
- Belief that the criticism threatens Sorbonne and decent people
- Concerned about intersubjective relationships in literature
- See a need to defend Sorbonne's reputation

**M. Picard vs. Nouvelle Critique:**
- Differences in approaches to literary analysis
- Perception of critical theories as contradictory, tumultuous, and even ridiculous
- Belief that the nouvelle critique is wide open to contemporary influences (existentialism, Freudianism, Marxism, structuralism)
- Concern about transformation of literature and its impact on understanding

**Impact of Revolution in Criticism:**
- Transformation already accomplished
- M. Picard's perspective seen as an attempt to preserve traditional approaches to literary analysis
- Sorbonne's role questioned in the face of contemporary thought
- Best writers are the stewards of literary heritage and renew it

**M. Picard vs. Modern Criticism:**
- Traditional academic dogmatism opposed to freedom and life
- M. Picard embodies the Sorbonne, but Barthes creates the literary works of our age.

**Significance:**
- The shift in critical perspective seen as an essential hermeneutic period focusing on "an inventory of significations"
- Important figures renewing literature and shaping contemporary thought.


#### Reflections on academic anti-intellectualism in literary studies: the decline of critical thinking and the dominance of bureaucracy.

**Critique on Literary Studies: Anti-intellectualism in Academia**

**The Problem of Academic Anti-Intellectualism**
- Intellectual community no longer focuses on Sorbonne or academic circles in France
- Revolution in criticism accomplished but not triumphed, remains marginal
- M. Picard's work praised despite misunderstanding of purpose
  - Believed to serve literary history
  - Encourages academic anti-intellectualism

**The Obstacle: Bureaucratic Organization of Literary Studies**
- Growth of libraries and publishing houses
- Academic publishing functions as a closed circuit
- No external sanction controls intellectual life

**New Critique and Living Thought**
- Calls into question academic system that produces it
- Protestation of individual thought
- Demands interdisciplinary training, defies administrative pigeonholes

**Dominant Aesthetic: Eclecticism and Bibliography**
- Claims to be eclectic, devoted to beauty, broad-minded
- Combines New Criticism with European academic conformism
- Defends autonomy of literature departments against other disciplines

**Reductionist Criticism**
- Barthes' work not reductionist as assumed
  - Analysis focuses on Racine's hero, not author or work
- Fear of reductionist criticism stems from fear of introspection and challenge to dominant aesthetic.


#### Reflection on literature, criticism, and the role of reductionism in understanding art and philosophy

**Reductionism in Criticism:**

**The Problem with Reductionist Labels:**
- Use of term "reductionist" can be limiting and pejorative
- Often used to criticize those who attempt synthesis of various disciplines (e.g., literature, philosophy)
- Does not account for the nuances in the thought process behind reduction

**Reduction vs. Criticism:**
- Focus is on what precedes reduction, not just the act itself
- Hegel's approach reduces everything to mind
- Anti-reductionism may lead to an empty critique with no substance

**Philosophical Criticism in Literary Studies:**
- Traditional criticism can be philosophical but not always recognized as such
- Contemporary criticism is often accused of being philosophical despite its wariness of philosophy
- Philosophical systems are analogous to preciosity in literature

**Structuralism and Reduction:**
- Structuralism reduces complex relationships between parts and wholes, whole and parts
- Brings out essential intuitions for authentic aesthetic understanding
- Permits interpretation without betraying the privileged place of great works

**Creating a New Academic Discipline:**
- Broadened interpretation may constitute a true academic discipline alongside literary history
- Repetitive works receive favorable reviews due to competition in the field
- Exceeding certain limits and maintaining the status quo should be avoided.


#### Crisis in literary studies: Beyond the separation of aesthetics and intelligence.

**The Crisis in Literary Studies**

**Sainte-Beuve's Audience**:
- Sainte-Beuve wrote for non-specialists
- Today, the Modern Language Association has over 20,000 "Sainte-Beuves" with no clear audience

**The Myth of the Common Reader**:
- The common reader is ungrateful and does not want to be condescended to
- The only criticism that interests them is the "new critique" of Goldmann and Barthes

**The "Publish or Perish" System**:
- This system creates a "mediocracy" of researchers attached to stock ideas
- Genuine talent gets lost in a mob dominated by timorous ultra-conservatism

**Intellectual Enlargement**:
- The times demand an effort to rethink all themes with today's intellectual resources
- Literary studies are in crisis, and traditional criticism finds itself at an impasse
- Avoiding the great problems only perpetuates this impasse

**The Lanson Era**:
- In Lanson's day, there was a belief that knowledge could be definitively divided into categories
- The idea of scientific precision referred to establishing facts, not just dividing literature into neat categories
- Words were seen as "watertight receptacles" for literary substance

**The Shifts in Literary Criticism**:
- The multiplicity of meanings and contradictions in terms like "Romanticism" showed that the words were not watertight
- This led to a rejection of equivocal terms and an attempt to base all knowledge on verbal reductionism


#### Reflections on literary studies and the evolving nature of criticism, classical vs romantic ideologies, and dialectical thought.

**Criticism of Contemporary Aesthetics and Literary History**

**The Problem with Literature's Privileged Status**:
- Literature does not enjoy a privileged status
- Current aesthetics submits to this criticism and renounces the claim to truth
- The categories of literary history depend on certain words and their history

**Modern Classicism and Romanticism**:
- **Classicism** makes a late entrance, more acrimonious than majestic
- **Romanticism** is opposed to Classicism within a system of oppositions
- Current criticism is reproached for looking at the past through 20th-century glasses

**Literary History and Unity**:
- Literary history does not unify, but can only add up
- The sum has no stability, every modification echoes throughout the system
- It is not a matter of correcting details but questioning the whole worldview

**Nerval and Romanticism-of-the-Classics**:
- Nerval cannot figure in the French romantic school as called for by Lanson's overall plan
- Nerval represents the ruins of a certain handbook Romanticism, which served as a buttress to Classicism

**Lanson and Dialectical Thought**:
- Lanson foresaw the dialectical nature of certain oppositions
- Intuitions can be systematized, and every opposition rests on a ground of identity
- We cannot ignore the problem of dialectical thought and the controversies surrounding language


### 14. Narcissism: The Freudian Myth  Demythified by Proust [1978]

**Narcissism: The Freudian Myth Demythified by Proust (1978)**

**Freud's Definition of Narcissism**:
- Attitude of a person who treats themselves as an object of sexual love
- "Object narcissism": Libidinal energy turned towards love objects that resemble the subject too much to qualify as real objects
- Narcissism is the condition of a subject who prefers never to get out of themselves, even when appearing to do so

**Freud's View on Narcissism**:
- Libidinal energy can be directed towards the self or a substitute, leading to narcissism, or towards real objects, leading to "true object-love"
- Normal for children to be highly narcissistic; adults should retain some degree of narcissism but not too much
- Excessively narcissistic adult is "imature"
- Narcissism plays a major role in Freud's theory of art and the artist

**Common Element among Artists and Writers**:
- Deliberate embrace and celebration of features of "excessive narcissism"
- Desire for loved objects to be reflections of the poet's self
- Reality is less beautiful, rich, authentic, and substantial than the self's private projections when the genuine otherness of outside reality breaks through

**Proust's Perspective**:
- People love primarily themselves; seek themselves in the objects of their desire
- Superior self radiates energy to transfigure commonplace reality into its own image, turning it into poetry
- Desire of a self that feels extremely "impoverished" or destitute, not the narcissistic model from earlier work

**Freud's Paradoxical View on Object-Love**:
- Narcissism has great attraction for those who have renounced part of their own narcissism and are seeking object-love
- Charm of a child, certain animals, criminals, and humorists lies in their self-sufficiency and inaccessibility
- Great charm of the narcissistic woman has its reverse side in the dissatisfaction and doubts of the lover about her love and enigmatic nature.


#### Comparing Proust and Freud's perspectives on desire, self-sufficiency, and narcissism in "Remembrance of Things Past" and psychoanalytic theory.

**Proust vs. Freud: Narcissism and Desire**

**Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past":**
- Description of desire portrays Proust as more mature, Freud as astute
- Corresponds to "great attraction" of one person's narcissism on others

**La Petite Bande:**
- Group of girls in Balbec-Cabourg
- Attracted by their tight-knit appearance and contemptuous indifference
- Behavior verges on juvenile delinquency, Marcel assumes they are impure
- Girls possess "blissful autonomy" and "self-sufficiency" that Marcel desires

**Comparing Proust to Freud:**
- Both describe narcissistic behavior in terms of animals (seagulls vs. cats/large birds of prey)
- Difference: Proust's narrator does not voluntarily renounce "self-sufficiency"
- Narrator feels impoverished, lacks "blissful autonomy," desires it from the group

**Freud's Perspective:**
- Those who have renounced "self-sufficiency" did so out of a sense of duty
- Proust's narrator does not choose to be "mature" or "virtuous"
- Narrator's lack of "self-sufficiency" is not a voluntary sacrifice but an impoverishment

**Desire in Proust:**
- Can be both self-oriented and other-oriented at the same time
- Desire for the richer, "self-sufficient" self that is already present in the desired other.


#### Proust's Desire vs. Freudian Narcissism: An Illusion of Self-Sufficiency

**The Proustian Solution: Narcissism Demythified by Proust**

**Freud's Perspective on Narcissism:**
- Freud believes in the existence of a substantial self (ego)
- Focuses on objects that are too similar to the subject, lacking true object-love

**Proust's Counterview:**
- Desire is not about narcissistic resemblance but absolute difference
- The "blissful autonomy" and "self-sufficiency" of desired objects are a mirage of desire
- No one can truly be a self-conscious narcissist as the self does not exist substantially
- Desire seeks self-sufficiency, but no one possesses it
- Desire is an illusion in which everyone collaborates and shares

**Proust's Novels: From Jean Santeuil to Remembrance of Things Past:**
- In Jean Santeuil, the hero appears to have "blissful autonomy" and "self-sufficiency"
- This novel is more representative of its time period but fails in conveying the subjective experience of desire
- The later novel, Remembrance of Things Past, successfully describes the experience of desire as it does not focus on the attainment of a substantial self.


#### Narcissism in Proust and Freud: Desire, Autonomy, and Myths.

**Desire and Narcissism in Proust's Works**

**Self-Sufficiency vs. Desire**:
- Self-sufficiency is incompatible with desire
- The author of "jean Santeuil" portrayed a self-sufficient character that was a "strategic extension of desire," rather than an authentic revelation

**Symbolism of the Box Scene**:
- In "jean Santeuil": The hero is in the center of attention, surrounded by "beautiful people"
- In Remembrance of Things Past: The narrator is outside the box, looking at the Duchess of Guermantes with desire
- The enclosure of the box symbolizes the autonomy and self-sufficiency belonging to the desired object

**Renunciation of Narcissism**:
- Freud believed in a "blissful autonomy" that can only be found in the desired object, which he envied
- He saw this as an "incongruity" between his renunciation of narcissism and his attraction to it
- The true nature of desire is to perpetually escape from the "predicament of desire," not to embrace or reject narcissism

**Theoretical Narcissism**:
- Freud's concept of narcissism as a theoretical construct is mythical, rather than rooted in his own experience
- His belief in the self-sufficiency of others was a projection of his own desires and delusions


#### A critique of narcissism: Proust's literary work vs. Freudian myth

**Critique of Narcissism in Proust's Work vs. Freudian Theory**

**Background:**
- Personal belief that Proust's critique of narcissism is more scientific than psychoanalysis
- Juxtaposition of self- and other-centeredness in Proust's work
- No individual can be purely narcissistic or altruistic

**Freudian Theory:**
- Mechanistic models: fixed quantity of libidinal energy
- Narcissism leaves no room for understanding desire paradoxes
- Substantial self and quantitative conception of the libido
- Belief in self-sufficiency functions like primitive conceptions of mana or sacred energy

**Proustian Critique:**
- Individuals with "intact narcissism" hoard mana, appear more divine
- Those with "impoverished narcissism" feel excluded from the divine
- Metaphors reveal a process of transfiguration similar to primitive sacred
- Greater poetic talent reaches farther and deeper than conceptual thought

**Implications:**
- Narcissism acts as an obstacle to understanding Proust's work
- Modern mind is easily seduced by the prestige of technical terms like "narcissism"
- Concept of narcissism confirms natural tendency to consider self- and other-centeredness as separate dominant poles.


#### Exploring the connection between literature and psychoanalysis: Proust vs. Freud.

**The Relationship Between Literature and Psychoanalysis**

**Intuition and Misconceptions**:
- Our intuition about relationships is incomplete and misleading
- The superiority of great novelists in understanding self-centeredness and other-centeredness remains invisible or paradoxical
- Freud was the first to attempt a systematic investigation of these relationships, which were previously the monopoly of creative writers

**Literary Critics and Psychoanalysis**:
- Literary critics have either been Freudian or against Freud
- If they are Freudian, they will not place literary texts on the same level as Freud's work
- If they are against Freud, they ascribe the failure of psychoanalysis in literary applications to a divine or irrational "literature" beyond the "sordid truths"
- Critics tend to avoid the topic of desire in Proust's work, focusing on other topics instead

**Bridging the Gap**:
- Literature and psychoanalysis need each other, rather than being viewed as separate domains
- A fair encounter between Narcissism and Remembrance of Things Past should reveal that the theory of narcissism is one of the most questionable points in psychoanalysis
- Proust's work provides a privileged access to Freud's texts, which psychoanalysis fails to deliver
- Other literary works, such as those of Cervantes, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, and Virginia Woolf, could also yield similar insights


### 15. Theory and Its Terrors1 [1989]

**Literary Criticism: Evolution and Challenges**

**Background:**
- Modern literature departments are a relatively recent creation
- Originated from the study of ancient cultures and Greek/Latin literature
- Grew in popularity with Romanticism and European nationalism
- Initially focused on literary history and critical editions
- Influenced by positivistic, scientistic ideology

**Challenges:**
1. **Shift towards more romantic, intuitive approaches**: opposition to scientific perspective in literature studies
2. Institutional resistance to change: universities as fortresses against the forces of change
3. Ambiguous nature of literary history: interdisciplinary scholar requirements
4. Rise of social sciences: perceived as true scientists, literary historians felt amateurish and impressionistic
5. Uncertainty about content analysis: lack of formal training in psychology, sociology, anthropology etc.
6. Sigmund Freud's influence: dreams interpreted as a science, literature became complex and difficult to understand for some specialists.

**Impact:**
- Literary people felt uncomfortable discussing the content of literary works due to their limited expertise
- Suspicion towards psychological, socio-logical, mythical or ritual aspects of literature
- Felt unable to provide competent insights into these areas without proper training.


#### The literary counterattack on social sciences: deconstruction and structuralism's critique of truth in language

**Background:**
- Scientific aspirations of literary studies undermined by neo-romantics
- Pressure to define literature's specificity and protect its existence as an autonomous academic enterprise
- Emphasis on form over content
- Rediscovery of the opposition of form and content
- Formalistic studies becoming unsubstantial

**Formalism:**
- Definition: examination of form in literary works
- Exaltation of form, often compared to plastic arts or shipbuilding
- Declaration that real purpose is to understand a work's structure, not its content
- Criticism for being abstract and unsubstantial

**Structuralism and Post-structuralism:**
- Background: response to scientific impulse and romantic feeling in literary studies
- Development in context of social sciences
- Influence from structural linguistics (Saussure, Jakobson)
- Rejection of referentiality in all texts
- Derrida's argument for absence of truth in any text
- Criticism of language's inherent illusion of substantiality and stability

**Impact on Literary Studies:**
- Successful in literary and philosophical circles
- Structuralism reconciles scientific impulse with romantic feeling
- Deconstruction continues the counterattack against imperialistic social sciences
- Influence from an aging, disenchanted culture seeking to undermine systems of thought.


#### The paradoxical impact of deconstruction and social sciences on intellectual progress.

**Impact of Deconstruction on Intellectual Life and Academia:**
- Similarities between social sciences and deconstruction's impact
- Neglect of traditional cultural knowledge in favor of latest research (social sciences belief in progress)
- Dangers of blind faith in latest research and media's belief in cumulative, progressive knowledge
- Deconstruction's criticism of this myth but end up behaving similarly
- Faith in progress replaced by faith in dismantling Western metaphysics
- Concerns about the anti-intellectual consequences of deconstructive doctrines

**Deconstruction and Academia:**
- Leaders insisting on studying philosophical discourse despite illogical foundation
- Epigones failing to take such precautions
- Example: Student's condescending response to criticism
- American optimism reasserting itself in strange ways

**Academic Tenure and Publication:**
- Path to tenure is publication
- Publish or perish law surviving cultural revolutions
- Difficulty in producing genuinely new and original work
- Simulation of originality by saying the opposite of previous publications.


#### Deconstructing literary criticism: Infinite interpretations, no hierarchy, and self-fulfilling prophecies

**The Dangers of Fads and Fashions in Scholarship**
- People who do genuine, brilliant work can be overshadowed by fads and fashions with little substance
- This is not limited to literary criticism, but occurs across fields like sociology, ethology, dietetics, etc.
- Researchers often try to overturn theories of their predecessors every 10 years for tenure
- This results in a cycle of top becoming bottom and bottom becoming top

**Deconstructive Criticism Principles vs Tenure Requirements**
- **Interpretation is infinite**: No limit to interpretations of texts, even non-literary ones
- Each reread produces a different interpretation, all of which should be published for tenure
- Plagiarism is impossible, as it cannot exist in this world of infinite interpretations
- Deconstructionists believe all interpretations are equally good and indispensable
- These principles make it impossible to exhaust possible interpretations on Milton's Paradise Lost

**Deconstructive Criticism vs Sociology of Literature**
- Some critical theories reduce great works of art to social circumstances of their creation
- However, this reductionism does not seem successful in understanding the current period and literary criticism as an industry
- The world where Western humanistic and ethical values have become meaningless is upon us, as described by deconstructive theory

**Deconstruction's Influence on Social Sciences**
- Deconstructive criticism has gained influence in departments of history and other social sciences
- This is due to its tendency to divorce itself from our cultural tradition, similar to the social sciences themselves
- Deconstruction may bring back the self-confidence and intolerance that are declining in the social sciences.


#### Critique of academic culture and its impact on intellectual life

**Theoretical Crisis in Academia: An Overview**

**Causes of Crisis:**
- Increase in academic population over last thirty years
- Broadening of higher education base
- Wealth of American universities leading to oversaturation
- Transformation from a world of producers and consumers
- Incompatibility between academic demands and intellectual life requirements
- Absence of meaningful communication within the academic community

**Symptoms of Crisis:**
- Mass guruism and fanatical embrace of pseudoradicalism
- Lack of interest in criticism from public
- Reversed roles: producers vs consumers
- Need to re-create intellectual life due to dissatisfaction with current system

**Effects of Crisis:**
- Overproduction of material leading to indifference towards genuine ideas
- Excessive communication barriers despite technological advances
- Depletion of human connection and recognition in intellectual pursuits

**Historical Context:**
- Collapse of complacent humanism associated with great texts
- Radical methodologies as rebellious children of New Criticism and formalism

**Impact on Intellectual Life:**
- Contradiction: necessary stimulus but excessive amounts can be detrimental
- Fatal disease in intellectual life, starting with an excitement and innovation that eventually kills genuine creativity.

**Examples:**
- Molière's Alceste as a valid portrait of the modern intellectual.


#### French Intellectual Life and the Escalation of Negative Thinking: Alceste and Celimene's Contradictions

**Alceste's Character**
- Portrayed as a profound thinker with "esprit de contradiction"
- Famous for wanting to be distinguished from others through constant contradiction
- Reduced to a single feature in classical genius: esprit de contradiction
- Struggled with success leading him to become a coquette or misanthrope
- Prefigures modern bad manners with fits of silent pouting

**The Role of Language**
- Classical genius reduced Alceste's arguments to "esprit de contradiction"
- Esprit de contradiction is not only about language but also power and impotence
- In a world dedicated to language, it becomes an essential feature

**Negative Thinking in French Intellectual Life**
- Two main phases: Hegelian and deconstructive
- Hegelian phase: focused on crushing errors through demystification, with a faint hope for universal synthesis
- Deconstructive phase: esprit de contradiction turns against itself, denouncing philosophy as a contradiction

**Alceste's Behavior**
- Ridiculous controversy with Oronte
- Unforgivable behavior when trying to court Eliante to spite Celimene
- Esprit de contradiction is a more elegant interpretation than his hypocrisy and clubbing everyone

**Celimene's Role**
- Arch-deconstructionist, contradicting herself without hiding it
- Turned self-contradiction into a novel kind of superiority
- Discarded the ancient ideal of self-consistency when convenient

**Structuralism and Poststructuralism**
- Two main phases in postwar French intellectual life: positive and negative
- Positive phase: everyone trying to reach a certain type of truth, ending in a deadlock with each advocating their own "truth" against others
- Negative phase: demonstration of the impossibility of reaching any kind of truth through formalism, structuralism, and poststructuralism
- Deconstructive stage of German idealism resembles language analysis in its heyday, both regarding language and truth as annihilated by their own negative process.


### 16. Love and Hate in Chretien de  Troyes' Yvain [1990]

**Competition for Fame in Chretien de Troyes' Yvain**

**Importance of Fame**:
- Knightly fame is not static, but mobile and unstable due to competitive nature
- Knights try to impress each other to gain admiration, leading to hysterical competitiveness
- Competition for fame is crucial in Chretien de Troyes' world, surpassing sexual desires

**Chivalry and Representation**:
- Chretien subordinates everything to chivalry
- Freudian views on repression and sublimation do not fully explain the competition for fame
- Sexual desire is present but not hidden in Chretien's work, appearing as symbolic expressions rather than signs of repression

**The Fountain of Youth**:
- The magical fountain at Esclados' domain represents Laudine's own femininity and the need for a famous husband to defend it
- Enide's words reveal her desire for her husband to be an accomplished knight, maintaining her own admiration and pride

**Competitive Nature of Love**:
- In Chretien's world, love can be intertwined with competition and prestige
- Women's desires extend beyond domesticity, seeking fame through their husbands' success

**Conclusion**:
- Chretien's work challenges the notion that duty and pleasure necessarily contradict each other
- The competitive nature of chivalry runs deep in the characters' lives, shaping their motivations and relationships.


#### Chretien de Troyes' Yvain: Love through competitive desire and chivalry.

**Themes and Analysis: Laudine and Yvain's Relationship**
* Laudine's husband dies in battle; she falls in love with his murderer, Yvain (1490-1582)
* Lunete encourages Laudine to move on, suggesting Yvain as a suitable partner due to his valor (1500-1578)
* Laudine initially resists, but eventually agrees to meet him after five days (1574-1582)
* Marriage between Laudine and Yvain is justified as political expediency (1603-2104)
* Competition drives the desire for love; everyone wants to marry the victor in feudal society
* Chretien's Yvain explores the scandalous nature of mimetric desire and ambition within aristocracy.

**Background: Laudine's Grief and Lunete's Encouragement**
- Laudine experiences deep grief after her husband's death (1490)
- Lunete, a trusted advisor, urges her to move on for the sake of political expediency (1500)
- Lunete suggests Yvain as a suitable partner due to his valor and victory in battle (1508)
- Laudine initially refuses, but eventually agrees to meet him after five days (1574)

**Marriage between Laudine and Yvain: Political Expediency or Scandalous Desire?**
* Marriage between widow and murderer is justified for political reasons in feudal society (1603-2104)
* Both women and men desire the victor as their partner, forming an agreement on Yvain's desirability.

**The Famous Duel Between Yvain and Gauvain: Competition and Love**
* The climax of the story revolves around the unknown duel between Yvain and Gauvain (2014)
* Both knights love each other like brothers but do not recognize one another during battle (2020)
* Each answer to whether they still love each other is correct in its own way.


#### Medieval knights' friendship and rivalry: Love, Hate, and prestige clash.

**The Duality of Love and Hate in Chretien de Troyes' Yvain**

**Background:**
- Two knights, Gawain and Yvain, are excellent friends and embodiments of chivalric ideal at Arthur's court
- Their friendship not by chance but a consequence of what they represent
- Both ranked highest in prestige, each sees other as revered model
- Tension arises from mutual imitation and competition for fame

**The Friendship**:
- Yvain and Gauvain have excellent reasons to be friends
- Each ranks self lower than the other, sees other as perfect illustration of what they should be
- Emulation is quintessence of chivalry

**The Rivalry**:
- Both knights are divided against themselves (Love and Hate inside each)
- Love and Hate are two sides of same coin
- Each tries to outshine the other, hiding it for sake of friendship

**The Famous Encounter**:
- Tension leads to climactic encounter at end of novel
- Purpose: answering ultimate question - who is best knight?
- Combat occurs in front of everybody at court, no potential opponents remain outside group.

**Love and Hate**:
- Both emotions present in the relationship between Yvain and Gauvain
- Love leads to blindness, confusion, and beguilement for both knights
- Hate fills them with mortal hatred, causing them to fight despite their friendship

**Conclusion:**
- Chretien de Troyes' Yvain portrays the complexity of emotions in relationships between respected figures within a group.
- The text is not an allegory but a literary exploration of rivalry and prestige that makes perfect sense through its portrayal of these two knights.


#### Medieval tale of two knights in endless, destructive competition and self-destructive mimetic rivalry

**The Tournament of Chretien de Troyes' Yvain**

**Knights Fighting for Admiration and Desire**
- Each knight fights to become the sole object of admiration and desire from all, including their opponent.
- The duel is a tournament watched by those who can express an opinion on the fighters and their fight.

**Symmetry in the Duel between Yvain and Gauvain**
- The two knights are so well matched that no decision can be reached.
- Both knights buy renown through anguish as they fight.
- They both wonder if they have met their match.

**The Forgotten Sisters**
- The two sisters represent the brotherly symmetry between the two champions.
- When they identify each other, both proclaim the victory of their friend with somber energy.

**Moral and Spiritual Parallels**
- The perfect match between the two knights is the key to the significance of the entire text.
- They can only go on fighting until they have annihilated the best soldiers of their king for no good purpose or for a purpose that is both nothing and everything in this competitive world.

**The Danger of Self-Destruction**
- The better knights fight one another instead of outsiders, which threatens to destroy the feudal system from within.
- The presence of the two doubles and their unending fight suggests that the novel should be defined as a mimetic and sacrificial crisis after the tragic and mythical pattern.

**The Paradoxical Society**
- The more harmony there is between the highest value and the actual behavior of its members, the greater the danger of self-destruction becomes.
- Feudalism is seen as barely institutionalized anarchy, with the king's authority being purely honorific and nominal.

**Mimesis: A Self-Devouring Monster**
- The life-giving principle is also a principle of death, as the same force that generates and perpetuates cultural differences dissolves its own creation when it turns into mimetic rivalry.
- The battle between Yvain and Gauvain comes close to showing this process explicitly, but the real message remains eluded.


### 17. Innovation and Repetition [1991]

**Innovation vs. Repetition**

**The Meaning of Innovation**:
- Originally meant "renewal, rejuvenation from inside"
- Became synonymous with "novelty" in modern usage
- Historically had negative connotations:
  - Departure from religious dogma (heresy)
  - Dangerous or suspicious
  - Synonymous with rebellion and revolution

**The Opposition to Innovation**:
- Theologians, politicians, and writers/literary theoreticians all opposed it
- Reformers saw the Reformation as a restoration, not an innovation
- Humanists looked back to ancient models instead of innovating
- Montaigne saw innovation as "nouvellete" (newness) and something to be feared

**The Fear of Innovation**:
- Reflected a world where cultural models were taken for granted
- The concept of innovation was only used in technical discussions of heresy
- People feared the loss of traditional models and the possibility of chaos
- This fear persisted until the 17th century, when the battle shifted to which models were best (traditional or modern)

**The Changing Meaning of Innovation**:
- The negative implications of "innovation" were well-established
- Diderot's view: "In a government, every innovation is to be feared"
- The French Revolution did not reinforce the old fear of innovation but contributed to its demise


#### The shift in meaning and perception of 'innovation' from negative to positive.

**Innovation: From Negative Connotation to Positive Perception**

**Background:**
- Abbe Raynal's Histoire philosophique (1770) rehabilitated innovation through contextual change
- Shift from theology towards science and technology
- No longer associated with heresy, instead linked to scientific progress

**Impact on Society:**
- Innovation became a god worshipped in all walks of life
- Replacement of negative connotations by positive ones

**Innovation vs. Imitation:**
- Two incompatible attitudes: innovation vs. imitation
- Negative view of innovation tied to stable imitation of transcendental models
- Individual freedom to adopt models or no model at all

**The Passion for Innovation:**
- Intensified during the 19th and early 20th centuries
- Definition becomes more radical, less tolerant of tradition
- Triggered successive upheavals in art (modernism)

**Innovation Mania:**
- Affects all aspects of human existence: literature, lovemaking, philosophy etc.
- Compulsory innovation can inflame the urge to mimic famous figures
- Philosophy succumbed to the "terrorism" of innovation with the emergence of epistemological rupture.

**Historical Context:**
- Rapid change in the world, faster than ever before
- Democratic revolution and industrial revolution coincided with scientific revolution
- Negative view of innovation rooted in a conception of spiritual and intellectual life dominated by stable imitation.


#### Imitation and innovation in economics: continuity and interdependence.

**Innovation and Repetition**

**The Idea of Rupture and Innovation**:
- The concept of "rupture epistemologique" made it possible to be both a traditional "aparatchik" and an innovator
- Psychoanalysts like Lacan and Freud were the first to take the full measure of Marx's innovative genius
- Each thinker had their own unique "ruptures" and "fragments" that defied communication with each other
- This led to a culture where individuals constantly reinvent themselves, rather than building on past knowledge

**Innovation and Repetition in Intellectual Thought**:
- Nietzsche's idea of refusing to be a model became the mark of genius
- The emphasis on ruptures, fragments, and discontinuities is still popular, particularly in universities
- Thinkers like Michel Foucault and Thomas Kuhn taught that true innovation involves creating entirely new paradigms

**Innovation in Economics**:
- Innovation has a precise definition in economics, including technical inventions, production techniques, and management
- It is the primary source of profits, as it gives businesses an edge over their competitors
- Innovation often requires imitating successful competitors, which can lead to genuine innovation over time

**The Continuous Nature of Innovation and Imitation**:
- Imitation and innovation are not only compatible but almost inseparable
- The process of imitation can lead to genuine innovation, even if it is incremental
- Examples abound, from the Americans surpassing Europeans to the Japanese becoming global innovators


#### Mimetic Rivalry and Innovation: The Complex Interplay of Imitation and Resistance in Modern Culture

**The Radical View of Innovation vs. Imitation**

**Inequality in Competition**:
- In "external mediation", models have an advantage due to being dead or superior
- In "internal mediation", models and imitators are more equal, leading to reciprocal imitation and competitive rivalry
- Defeat in competition is disagreeable, as it acknowledges the superiority of the winner

**Resistance to Imitation**:
- The urge to imitate is strong, but so is the urge not to imitate
- This can lead to counter-imitation, where losers try to demonstrate independence by acting opposite to winners
- This can be detrimental to self-interest and turn into self-destructive pride

**Innovation in the Arts**:
- The rules of competition may be objectively unfair, but this is perceived differently by winners and losers
- Nations dislike the image of defeat and may resort to violence or protectionist measures
- Intellectuals often see competitiveness as evil, missing the complex consequences of democratic equality
- This has led to repression of mimetic rivalry and a "revolt against the very principle of education"

**Economic Innovation**:
- Economic life is an example of internal mediation that produces innovation through ritualized rivalry
- Economic agents openly imitate successful rivals, unlike in other domains where radical innovation dominates


### 18 Mimetic Desire in the  Underground: Feodor Dostoevsky [1997]

**Mimetic Desire in Dostoevsky's Underground:**

**Background:**
- Mimetic desire: imitative or reducationist construct some view as impoverishing literature
- Objections raised against the concept during author's career
- Definition: desire rooted in a third party, model or mediator

**Role Models and Imitation:**
- Young people should imitate good role models for successful development
- Mimetic rivalry leads to escalating desires and conflicts between individuals
- Adults also imitate one another fiercely, often unconsciously

**Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground:**
- Hero: insignificant man with strong desire to overturn obstacles (models)
- Desire for both overturning and fusion with the obstacle (model)
- Revenge through mimicking own insulter
- Frustrated rivalries go underground, leading to psychopathological symptoms in Dostoevsky's characters.

**Underground People:**
- Hide imitations from themselves and others to avoid humiliation
- Dostoevsky grants technical value to the term 'underground', representing frustrated mimetic desires.


#### Mimetic desire in literature: Understanding human interconnectedness through jealousy and rivalry

**Mimetic Desire in Dostoevsky's Work: The Eternal Husband and Unconscious Homosexuality**

**Background:**
- Culture steeped in psychoanalytical theories, particularly Freud's hypothesis of latent homosexuality
- Mimetic desire offers a better explanation for the eternal husband's behavior

**The Eternal Husband's Infatuation with His Rival (Mimetic Desire):**
1. Seeks model for seduction improvement
2. Irrational yet logical based on erotic expertise
3. Invites rival to meet prospective bride for approval
4. Hoping for rival's desire towards her
5. Frantic desire for revenge and constant humiliation
6. Role reversals in relationships, including with Liza
7. Desire cannot be understood through objects or subjects
8. Two men's roles interchangeable in certain cases
9. Infinitely diverse desires that change
10. Mimetic theory explains human beings' inability to be realists

**Underground Man vs Utilitarianism:**
- Dostoevsky contrasts lifestyle to English philosophers' theories
- Rejection of religious faith and conventional morality
- Desire for enlightened self-interest
- The underground man's troubles stem from intense mimetic desire
- Gravitates around human obstacles, despite being selfish in nature.

**Mimetic Desire:**
- Two or more desires converge on the same object
- Increases value of any object significantly
- Cannot be understood through objects or subjects
- Demonstrated through The Underground Man's life contradicting self-interest.


#### Mimetic Desire: Dostoevsky's exploration of human impoverishment and self-enslavement through the underground man's exacerbated desire for those who spurn him.

**Dostoevsky's "Notes from Underground": The Law of the Underground**

**Enlightened Self-Interest vs. Obscurantist Other-Interest:**
- Dostoevsky reveals how "enlightened self-interest" can give way to its opposite - "obscurantist other-interest" or "unenlightened self-enslavement".

**The Underground Man and Normal Society:**
- The underground man is a caricature of tendencies present in all human beings.
- Most people keep their own "underground" hidden, even from themselves.

**Mimetic Desire and the Underground Law:**
- Dostoevsky's art highlights contrasts to clarify the existence of an "underground law".
- This law is best understood through mimetic desire - a relatively benign illness that can become the "mimetic obstacle addiction".

**Mimetic Obstacle Addiction:**
- Underground people are attracted to those who spurn them, and spurn those who are attracted to them.
- This leads to misfortune and behavior opposite to "enlightened self-interest".

**The Dramas in Notes from Underground:**
1. Arrogant officer story: Illustrates the first half of the underground law.
2. Dismal school reunion: Illustrates the second half of the same law.
3. Kind prostitute story: Shows how the kind prostitute is brutally rejected by the underground man.

**Hell Exists:**
- The interplay of obstacles and models in Notes from Underground reveals a version of hell with religious significance.

**Mimetic Desire as Reductionist:**
- Mimetic desire can be seen as reductionist, according to critics who value the "ineffable and inexhaustible je ne sais quoi" in fiction.
- Dostoevsky seeks to convey the stark reality of an impoverished psychological life.

**The Impoverishment of Life:**
- Mimetic desire and obstacle/model obsession enable understanding the law of self-impoverishment when realistically portrayed.
- The underground hero behaves like an automaton, leading to a monotonous and repetitive life.

**Modern Society and Transcendence:**
- Dostoevsky's preoccupations touch on social, historical, and religious themes as faith recedes from the modern world.
- Modern man must rely on others for guidance in a vast, complex society without fixed transcendental reference points.


#### Modern society's obsession with experts and the paradoxical nature of mimetic desire in Dostoevsky's works.

**The Modern World of Experts vs Subjective Experience**

**Experts vs Subjective Experience**:
- The modern world is one of experts
- Our subjective experience is limited to directing us to the right experts
- The eternal lover is an expert in sentimental life and lovemaking
- The hero's choice of the wife's lover as a model for his own erotic life is rational in the Cartesian sense

**Rationality Surrendering to Experts**:
- Rationality torn from religious moorings surrenders its liberty to experts
- Experts are competent, whereas the individual is incompetent
- The individual clings to experts to prevent a "precariou balance" and "unsteady gait"

**The Eternal Husband's Obsession with Obstacles/Models**:
- The eternal husband treats the eternal lover like a ferocious sexual idol to be propitiated and blackmailed
- He sacrifices all women in his life for this "demonic religiosity"
- The death of Liza is significant as it marks the individual's loss of transcendence

**Individual Pride and the Underground**:
- Increasing individual pride leads to an "underground other-centeredness" that is not altruistic
- Mimetic desire is failed selfishness, impotent pride that generates worshipful imitation of unrecognized idols
- The modern world brings back forms of self-enslavement that Western society had escaped

**The Paradoxical Process of Revolution**:
- Social norms and restraints exist to suppress mimetic rivalry
- Revolutions originate in victims of this situation, who blame the restrictions on the social order
- The revolutionary mystique pursues the complete destruction of the social order
- This exacerbates mimetic rivalries rather than alleviating them
- As the social order collapses, it appears more oppressive and repressive to revolutionists


#### Dostoevsky's prophetic depiction of revolution's destructive aftermath and human nature's oscillation between extremes

**Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment" and Shigalyov:**
* Shigalyov, a character from Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment," acquires a prophetic dimension due to his accurate prediction of the Russian Revolution.
* Shigalyov is an honest revolutionist who spells out the consequences of his principles for fellow activists.
* Genuine prophecy often sounds indecent to those whose minds are closed to its truth.
* Professional historians are wary of acknowledging prophecy due to fear or hope that historical "necessity" may not have been disproved.
* Shigalyov's predictions of the suppression of liberties in the name of revolution were not taken seriously by many, including experts and critics.

**Dostoevsky's Reactionary Politics:**
* Dostoevsky was deeply influenced by the spirit of his age and susceptible to scientism and materialism.
* He lived during a time when "scientific materialism" was triumphant.
* Despite his understanding of the negative usefulness of religion as a social prop, he personally struggled with genuine religious faith.
* His reactionary political leanings were reinforced by the smugness of the West and its claims of moral and spiritual superiority.
* Dostoevsky satirized the Western influence on Russia during his time but can also be excessive and unjust in his criticisms.

**Understanding Dostoevsky:**
* Before dismissing Dostoevsky for political reasons, we must remember that he was deeply concerned about Russia's need for reforms.
* He fiercely criticized both revolutionists and conservatives, the original free-marketeers.
* Dostoevsky's work is not reactionary at its best; he understood that tsarist autocracy and the Orthodox Church could not provide lasting answers to the problems of his day.


### 19. Conversion in Literature and Christianity1 [1999]

**The Relationship Between Literature and Christianity**

**Personal Experience**:
- The author's intellectual and spiritual journey began with literature and myth, leading to the study of the Bible and Christian Scripture
- Great literature led the author to Christianity
- This is a common occurrence since the beginning of Christianity

**Literature as a Guide Through Hell**:
- Dante's use of Virgil in "The Divine Comedy" symbolizes how profane literature can guide one through hell and purgatory
- Virgil was regarded as a prophet of Christ, and Dante appreciated him, which helped the author in his spiritual journey

**Mimetic Desire and Frustration**:
- The more modern the novel becomes, the more it leads to a "hellish" world where desires and relationships are dominated by mimetic imitation
- This can result in endless frustration, as desires and prestige constantly shift between oneself and one's models
- The worst kind of frustration is when one is disenchanted and cannot find a new model for their desire

**The Failure of Desire**:
- Freud's view that desire is immortal and eternal does not acknowledge the mortality and finitude of desire
- Great literature, particularly the individualism of our time, denies the failure of desire
- Mimetic desire makes one believe they can become self-sufficient, which turns them into an "ass" rather than a god

**Religion and Conversion**:
- Judaism and Christianity preach no self-fulfillment or self-absorption
- Conversion is a personal intervention of God in one's life, not something of one's own doing
- The greatest experience for Christians is the feeling that God is intervening in their lives during a radical change


#### The significance of radical conversion in Christianity and literature, contrasting circular and linear perspectives.

**Religious Conversion vs. Christian Conversion**
* Definition of conversion: a radical change or transformation leading to a new beginning, not circular as in the original Latin meaning
* Christian conversion: irreversible change resulting in a new being with no return to the past
* Augustine's use of conversio in The City of God referred to Satan's efforts to prevent conversion, not the experience itself
* Metanoia (Greek): changing one's mind or perception, weaker than Christian repentance and conversion
* Donatists: fourth-century Christians taking conversion seriously, refusing re-integration for those who did not endure persecution
	+ Absolute view of conversion as something momentous that cannot happen twice
	+ Great importance placed on the notion of conversion in early Christianity.

**Literary Creation and Conversion**
* Writers view genius as a result of personal transformation, resembling a conversion experience
* Proust's relationship between literature and Christian conversion: hero becomes novelist after rupture or break that he did not cause.


#### Proust's aesthetic and spiritual transformation: A comparison to literary conversions and Christianity.

**Proust's Novel as a Spiritual Autobiography: The Conversion Experience**

**The Illness and Depression**:
- Hero suffers great illness and profound depression
- No longer hopes to become a great writer
- Trivial incidents trigger an aesthetic and spiritual illumination

**The Two Perspectives**:
1. Deceptive perspective of desire:
   - Frustrated desires that lead to ennui and post-mimetic desire
2. Liberating perspective from conversion:
   - Transformation enabling the novelist to write their work

**Significance of Novel Titles**:
- A la recherche du temps perdu (Searching for Lost Time)
- Time Recaptured: Story of spiritual death and rebirth

**Proust's Conversion Pattern**:
- Quasi-monastic isolated living condition
- Interest in Christianity, sought advice from Andree Gide
- Metamorphosis from talented amateur to genius

**Comparison with Religious Conversion**:
- Comparable to a religious conversion
- Bore only aesthetic fruit and never resulted in a religious conversion
- Functions like a religious conversion

**Other Novelists' Conversion Experiences**:
- Don Quixote's repentance on deathbed
- Julien Sorel's impending guillotining in The Red and the Black
- Madame Bovary's arsenic consumption
- Raskolnikov's Siberian exile in Crime and Punishment


### 20. The Passionate Oxymoron in  Shakespeare's Romeo and juliet [2005]

**The Passionate Oxymoron in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet**

**True Love in Shakespearean Comedies**:
- All characters infatuated with one another see themselves as perfect embodiments of "true love"
- Love is true to the extent that the two partners are interested in each other exclusively and indifferent to intermediaries, go-betweens, and third parties
- "True love" is the Elizabethan equivalent of a great or authentic passion, insisting on its independence from the world and other people

**The Contradiction of "True Love"**:
- In Shakespeare's comedies, "true love" constantly runs into trouble
- Lovers do not feel responsible for the misfortunes of true love, seeing themselves as innocent victims of tyrannical parents, jealous friends, and other meddlers
- **The concept is suffused with the spirit of modern individualism**

**Romeo and Juliet**:
- Romeo and Juliet are fiercely loyal and honest with one another
- Juliet's refusal to "act coy" with her lover is an indication of her "truth" or "authenticity"
- The love affair is too short to be tested for its durability
- Juliet is compared to the character Cressida, who surrenders too quickly and impetuously to her first lover
- Troilus, Juliet's first lover, is presented as being more at fault than Cressida

**The Special Problem Posed by Romeo and Juliet**:
- The mutual hatred of the Montagues and Capulets plays an enormous role in the play
- Shakespeare resorts to external factors to spice up the "rather tasteless love affair"
- The balcony scene is notable for Juliet's unwillingness to shut her window or call her father, unlike other Shakespearean heroines


#### The oxymoron's role in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet: Love's paradoxical language.

**Blood Feud in Romeo and Juliet**
- **Young Man's Sense of Courtesy**: acknowledges the normalcy of fear and violence resulting from a blood feud
- **Literary Device**: Blood feud serves as a literary device, affecting the language of passion, particularly Juliet's expression of love for Romeo
- **Oxymoron in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet**
  - **Early Twentieth Century Criticism**: oxymoron seen as self-indulgent and a sign of youthful weakness in the play
  - **Importance of "True Love"**: humanists valued authentic passion, considering Romeo and Juliet a masterpiece highlighting it
  - **Oxymoras in Juliet's Speech**: seemingly contradictory expressions, such as "serpent heart hid with a flowing face" (3.3.76-85)
    * Traditional reasoning: oxymora are unreasonable and should be avoided
    * Counterargument: oxymoras reflect the chaos of Juliet's emotions due to conflicting love and hatred
  - **Author's Intent**: possible irony or parody in the abundance of oxymoras, not necessarily an attempt to break a record or portray Juliet/Shakespeare as compulsive producers of them.
- **Impression Without Context**: if read separately from the play, the oxymora would be understood as expressions of a woman grieving her lover's infidelity rather than the death of a relative.


#### Exploring the intensity of love through Shakespeare's use of passionate oxymorons.

**The Passionate Oxymoron in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet**

**Oxymora and Erotic Jealousy**:
- The oxymoron "fiend angela" suggests a love stronger than one conveyed by mere positive words.
- This is because the negative feelings (jealousy, anger, resentment) make the passion seem stronger rather than weakening it.
- This is the "language of erotic jealousy," not the language of mourning.

**Mimetic Desire and Frustration**:
- Mimetic desire arises when one desires an object that another person desires.
- This leads to universal rivalry and frustration, even when one achieves the desired object.
- The "inaccessible woman" often combines the roles of object and model, keeping the lover at bay to maintain their enslavement.

**The Oxymoron in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet**:
- Shakespeare reinforces the spontaneous reaction to the oxymora, suggesting Juliet's intense, obsessive love for Romeo despite the "mistake" in the plot.
- The oxymoron reflects the "real impression conveyed by Juliet's tirade," her madly passionate, hysterical love.
- This is because the negative feelings intensify the passion rather than diminishing it.


#### Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet: Oxymoronic Love and Mimetic Violence

**The Passionate Oxymoron in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet**

**Murder of Tybalt**:
- Provides a pretext for the "deluge of oxymora" that follows
- Romeo did everything to avoid the duel, making Tybalt's death not a criminal offense
- Allows Shakespeare to explore intense emotions in the love story without making it violent in reality

**Oxymoronic Language**:
- Used to convey the "intense passion" expected by the audience
- Replaces the "infidelity that Romeo should commit" with the blood feud
- Allows Juliet to express intense jealousy without having a real cause

**Nurse's Response**:
- Misunderstands Juliet's passionate tirade, assuming it means hatred for Romeo
- Juliet clarifies her true feelings in positive terms to avoid misunderstanding

**Friar Laurence and Romeo**:
- Romeo explains his shift from Rosaline to Juliet based on responsiveness

**The Oxymoron as Realism**:
- Represents the "hypermimetic world" of passionate love
- Critics who see it as artificial miss its mimetic nature and consequences

**Conclusion**:
- The oxymoronic style is a realistic representation of how lovers behaved in that era
- The blood feud allows Shakespeare to explore intense emotions while maintaining the purity of the true love between Romeo and Juliet.


#### Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet: Passionate Oxymoron and the Blood Feud

**The Fusion of Love and Hate**
- The fusion of words that apply to the love affair with those that apply to the blood feud creates a "splendid expression" that sounds like an intensely passionate love
- This is seen in Juliet's lines about her love for Romeo being "sprung from my only hate" and her realization that she must love a loathed enemy
- These lines are based on the same principle as Juliet's earlier tirade, which also uses oxymoronic language to describe her emotions
- The blood feud between their families plays an essential role in this "oxymoronic style" by adding depth and intensity to the love affair

**The Rhetorical Dimension of Romeo and Juliet**
- Shakespeare's use of oxymoronic language is more successful in these lines than in Juliet's earlier tirade, as it is factually and poetically justified
- The interpenetration of the blood feud and the love affair is intentionally created by the playwright to add "poetic miracles" and "deliberately ludicrous effects"
- Romeo is Juliet's "loathed enemy," but their love is not diminished by this enmity between their families
- This "contamination of the love affair and the blood feud" creates a "mutual mimetic contagion" that drives the story forward

**The Mimetic Desire in Romeo and Juliet**
- Romeo and Juliet are "star-crossed lovers" who must navigate the mimetic desires that drive their love for each other
- Shakespeare mocks the idea of "true love" by having Romeo kiss a Capulet girl at the beginning, only to later profess his love for Juliet
- The play within the play in A Midsummer Night's Dream satirizes the idea of a double suicide, which is borrowed from another romantic tale
- Shakespeare intentionally manipulates our mimetic desires to turn the story of Romeo and Juliet into a powerful myth
