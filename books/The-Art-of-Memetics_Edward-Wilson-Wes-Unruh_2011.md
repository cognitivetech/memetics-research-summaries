### 1 Evaluating Tools

**Memetics, Magic, and Related Concepts**

**Magic**:
- Defined as making the improbable possible
- Learning how small changes can have radical effects on psychology/spirituality and environment

**Memes**:
- Units of cultural inheritance, as described by Richard Dawkins in "The Selfish Gene"
- Memetics can be used to understand various phenomena like word-of-mouth effects, viral video development, and more

**Masterminds, Egregores, and Cybernetics**:
- Mastermind groups: complex webs of consciousness that emerge from laying down goals and networks for transmitting memes
- Egregores: hive minds that watch over a group, capable of transmitting memes across networks
- Cybernetics: deals with systems that embody goals and networks for meme transmission, including internal psychic processes, media narratives, religious/governmental/corporate institutions, and social settings

**Magic vs. Other Disciplines**:
- Magic was once a larger field of study, but many ideas have been isolated and reformulated in other fields
- The study of magic can provide value by grounding in the theory and experience of causing the improbable to become possible
- Elements of magic can be found in various disciplines like NLP, marketing, and psychology

**Terministic Screens and Reality Tunnels**:
- We don't react directly to the world but rather through the filters of our nervous system's habits of punctuation
- Kenneth Burke's terministic screen and Robert Anton Wilson's Reality Tunnels concepts are similar

**Authors' Perspective**:
- Attempting to bring together trends in marketing, infopreneurship, and the occult from a critical, subjective stance
- Using terms like egregore and sigil to illustrate dynamic forces within group minds and approaches to harnessing them

**Two Models of Memetics**:
1. Seed or virus model: small scale individual signals infect hosts and predispose them to certain actions
2. Entity model: larger memetic structures act on the world through people who hold the belief sets, as if the memetic entities were intentional beings


#### Understanding memetics: Memes as virtual ideas in human social networks and cyberspace.

**Meme Space: Understanding Memetics and Its Relation to Cyberspace**

**Concept of Meme Space**
- Virtual space created by nodes of communication network with memory
- Exists in the 'imaginal time' of communication occurring
- Comparison to cyberspace
  - Nodal memory as pattern allowing cyberspace to exist
  - Human social networks also create a form of cyberspace (meme space)

**Meme Space vs. Meme Space as Long Tail Distribution**
- Two models of memetic space: virtual and long tail distribution
- Virtual meme space is smooth, while long tail is striated
- Memes are more than linguistic phenomena
- Understanding memetic ecosphere and meta-biological organisms in the meme space is crucial for memeticist

**Meme's Survival Dependent on Persistence in Nodal Memory**
- Meme inclines host organism to actions that further its survival
- Actions increase replication via communication networks or in memory
- Memes spread through performance as well as verbal interaction

**Book as a Capsid for Memes**
- This book serves as a 'capsid' for memes to survive and spread
- Communication between potential hosts and way to interact with their motivational systems essential for meme survival

**Memetics and Social Change**
- New technological advances in communication media encourage changes in social order towards supporting those new mediums
- Internet has triggered more memes promoting social change due to its widespread accessibility.


### 2 Agency in a Networked World

**Agency in a Networked World:**
* Memetics: Ignoring agency is not possible, as it impacts free will (omega point) and control in a world constrained by evolution and cybernetic feedback
* Understanding systems: important for self-control and manifesting change
* Systems consist of subsystems or circuits with multiple pathways
* Humanity exists between consciousness and physical bodies
* Marketing techniques use framing to influence perception and bias reactions
* Illusion of agency: focus on results, not individual control or decision making
* Cybernetic network model: human world influenced by upper and lower worlds
* Every component in a cybernetic system is constrained by the circuit it's part of
* Memes exist in the collective minds' cyberspace; understanding the hardware that runs this space important for decision making
* Internet has exponentially accelerated feedback loops, making the world more reactive.

**Understanding Systems:**
* Increase awareness of how systems work
* Examine connections, inputs, outputs, and transformations
* Multiple pathways: signals can take through subsystems
* Greater understanding leads to greater control and potential for change.

**Agency vs Reality:**
* Illusion of agency: focus on results instead
* Human existence is between consciousness and physical bodies
* Middle world of humanity influenced by upper and lower worlds
* Every component in a cybernetic system is constrained by the circuit it's part of.

**Marketing Techniques:**
* Framing techniques used to influence perception and bias reactions
* Raise objections to answer them, making messages more likely accepted without reflection
* Three-fold effect: accepts message without reflection, weakens opposing arguments, frames debate in marketer's favor.

**Understanding Memes:**
* Memes exist in the collective minds' cyberspace
* Understanding hardware that runs this space essential for decision making
* Internet has accelerated feedback loops, making world infinitely more reactive.


### 3 MindBodyBircolage

**Bricolage and Mind/Body Connection**
* The body is made of bricolage: cholesterol and proteins arranged over time into a cohesive structure
* The self is created through remixing available memes, forming subcultures around defining, transforming, or refusing specific aspects of culture
* Selecting a self from available memes produces a conceptual bricolage that forms the basis of one's identity
* Memes breed and mutate within this shared space, with stress acting as an emotional marker and agitator of evolution
* Stress-forming experiences are more memorable due to their survival significance
* Forming bonds in the face of stress can lead to tribal core formation and adaptation to socioeconomic pressures

**Memetics and Communication**
* Memes use communication to change emotional states, leading to physiological changes and altered actions
* Memetics is socially embedded as it relies on human communication behaviors
* Modern communication systems like video are post-linguistic, juxtaposing action and meaning
* Terrorism gains power from its ability to directly show events with dramatic impact

**Memetic Bodies**
* A memetic body includes the people who share the meme and the objects they use to achieve its intention
* Memes have a vector and mass that can be affected through force, physical alteration, or engineered phage transmission
* Phagic repurposing is a method of altering behavior by imparting coded information tailored to an existing meme.


### 4 Belief as a Meta-Condition Paradigm and Brand

**Belief as a Meta-Condition: Paradigm and Brand**

**Misapplying Metaphors**:
- Scientific theory is more mutable than magical theory
- Applying metaphors appropriate for Newtonian physics to cybernetic systems is "superstitious by way of over-simplification"
- Belief is a "subjective quality based on direct experience with the absolute idea in mental space"
- Direct experience is an "intense imprinting moment as a result of a buildup of meaning, then a catalyst to trigger the new internal state"

**Belief and Contradictions**:
- Beliefs are subjective qualities based on direct experience
- Contradictions in belief systems can lead to instability, which can be exploited to introduce new beliefs
- Aggressively questioning someone's beliefs can lead them to question their own reality, making them more receptive to new ideas

**Manipulating Belief**:
- **Chaos magic**: a recent form of magic influenced by postmodernism
- To manipulate belief, find the "angle" or worldview of the person and enter their "movement" (i.e., agree with their reality)
- Throw them off balance by finding a contradiction in their beliefs, then offer your ideas as a solution to their feelings of doubt

**Social Networks and Feedback Loops**:
- Our social network is like a network of signal propagation
- Constructing feedback loops of the right intensity can achieve socially desirable effects for individual nodes
- **Magic**: a hodgepodge of pragmatic techniques supported by mythological explanations and traditions
- **Chaos magic**: an approach aimed at unifying different models into a cohesive system, focusing on manipulating belief in specific ways
- Marketting, memetics, and masterminding are just the start; other magicians are working in various fields to reintegrate magic and science


### 5 Meta-Biological Organisms

**Meta-Biological Organisms: Egregores as Group Minds**

**Definition of a Mind:**
- Total cybernetic information system involved in an action (Bateson)
- Not limited to individual human agent
- Part of larger group minds or egregores

**Egregores:**
- Defined as embodiments of convergences of forces
- Exhibit memory, intentionally, and cognition
- Can be religious, institutional, or corporate
- Manifest in temples, structures, iconography for religious egregores
- Geographically bound for institutional egregores
- Impossible to kill as legal entities (corporate egregores)

**Characteristics of Egregores:**
- Memetic carriers
- Longer lifespans than individuals
- Adaptable across cultures
- Influence human evolution and behavior

**Religious Egregores:**
- Symbolically represented in deities and archetypes
- Temples, structures, iconography are manifestations of these egregores
- Spread through mythologies and archetypes

**Institutional Egregores:**
- Geographically bound
- Difficult for marketers/memeticists to understand due to long lifespans

**Corporate Egregores:**
- Youngest type of egregore
- Legally recognized as legal persons in their own right (1886)
- Technically immortal bodies

**Unconscious Mind:**
- Total mental processes not capable of conscious registration
- Consists of conscious, preconscious, and unconscious parts
- Conscious mind: aware of what one is cognitively aware of
- Preconscious mind: repository of memory, can be accessed by the conscious mind with effort
- Unconscious mind: mental processes that remain beneath the perception of the conscious mind (automatic functions like breathing, heart rate, etc.)

**Learning Process:**
- Four phases: unconscious incompetence, conscious incompetence, conscious competence, and unconscious competence.


### 6 Becoming What You Do

**Understanding Stress and Change**

**The Impact of Stress on Behavior:**
- Survival significance of stress leads to stronger imprinting of experiences
- Forming bonds under stress results in more intense relationships
- Stress provides energy for situation-appropriate responses
- Goal is to discover truer, freer self by breaking conditioning

**The Rapidity of Technological Change:**
- Novelty promotes growth in neural network of brain
- Continuous new experiences lead to altered understanding of possibilities
- Observation and optimism are essential for change
- World is always changing; focus on objectives and allow time for subconscious processing

**The Importance of Understanding Objectives:**
- Write down goals without creating a plan
- Let subconscious mind begin processing desire before analytical process
- Let go, relax, and anticipate transformation
- Recognize the world is always in motion

**Impact of Stress on Functioning:**
- Structuring self and social network effectively during stress crucial for long term sustainability
- Pretending or embodying a role can imprint into preconscious and unconscious mind
- Actors may struggle to get out of character due to embodiment of archetype
- Understanding potential impact of roles on personality is essential for effective self-actualization.

**Neurolinguistic Programming:**
- Modeling a role can cause changes in behaviors, but not all changes are desirable
- Being aware of potential effects and understanding the longer-lasting impact of engaging in a role is crucial
- Freedom comes from making choices with greater responsibility.

**The Impact of Technology on Perception of Time:**
- Past exists in documented or undocumented state online, but not in meatspace
- Present exists only in meatspace and future comes into being based on what's happening now
- Examining failings and weaknesses with brutal honesty can lead to developmental power.


#### Exploring information overload and empowerment through digital networks and self-discovery.

**Understanding Information Overload and Networked Reality**

**The Current Information Landscape:**
- Bombarded by more cultural signals than ever before
- Two classes emerging: those who can navigate information (empowered) and those controlled by it
- Information glut is liberating for some, overwhelming for others
- Access to an overwhelming array of information
- Burden of evaluating this information lies heavily upon us

**Strategies for Navigating the Information Overload:**
- Develop techniques to offset individual handicaps within mastermind groups
- Play to strengths and focus on areas of weaknesses strategically
- Knowing one's weaknesses or strengths helps develop focused teams
- Make a habit of practices for improvement and compound small changes into large ones

**The Shift from Media Consumer to Media Producer:**
- Internet enabling individuals to produce media content
- People have more control over what media they consume
- Search engines, RSS feeds, keyword tags, and peer file sharing allowing for effective filtering of information

**Implications of the Information Ecology:**
- Old institutional marketing concept of "if you're not everywhere, you're nowhere" has become a reality
- People can cocoon themselves in media that confirms their pre-existing biases
- Fractal notions of self-similarity in memetic construction can introduce new energy and entrench stagnation

**Access to Information:**
- Most information is already available, but some remains classified or protected
- What's needed is the ability to find and assemble useful instruction from existing information

**Changing the Story: Hypertext and Co-creational Aspects:**
- Hypertext allows for nonlinear navigation across and through texts
- Changes in how people use text are only starting to be felt
- Storyteller has immense power to change people's worlds by altering narratives.


### 7 Memetic Ecology in Action

**Memetic Ecology: Thoug ht Contagion Analysis by Aaron Lynch**

**Overview**
- Memetics compared to fictional science of Psychohistory
- Integration of memetics with cooperative game theory, information sciences, and post-structural practice grounded in sociologica l theory

**Memes and Belief Systems**
- Memes at conversion point for desires leading to actions
- Attachment to needs/desires, motivate action
- Exist across individuals, form group minds
- Influence outcomes based on requisite variety

**Requisite Variety**
- Number of options in response to input
- Greater number of conversational gambits leads to greater adaptation and engagement
- Importance in job interviews: ability to recognize questions behind the question, answer relevantly

**Improving Processing, Input, and Output**
- Increase subtlety of distinctions (inputs), responses (output), and outcomes desired
- Conscious learning cycle from unconscious incompetence to conscious competence

**Examples of Requisite Variety at Work**
- Interpersonal interactions: more options lead to greater success in social situations
- Job interviews: ability to recognize interview questions and answer relevantly is crucial for success.


### 8 Effectively Transmitting

**Effectively Transmitting: Memetic Perspective on Manifestation**
* Agrippa's three-layered web of manifestation: intellectual space primary
* Textual roots in Agrippa's writings
* Intellecutal space assumes primacy over elemental and celestial spaces
* Memeticists focus on this space for engineering experiences, mastermind techniques, symbolic literacy
* Mastermind groups as sources of memetic evolution
* Streamlining communication effectiveness: marketing as persuasion model
	+ Emotionally connected with reactions to favorite shows
	+ Objections raised and answered in ads for effective transmission
	+ Three reasons why this is effective: passes rational muster, frames conceptual space, biased reaction toward end goal
* Memes transmitted through non-linguistic behaviors (handshakes)
	+ Interpreted as a signifier within culture by those outside it
* Survival of memes requires communication and triggering of motivational systems
	+ Non-linguistic: relation to pleasure/pain
	+ Linguistic: emotional appeals, perspective modeling
* Framing an encounter or interaction for desired outcome
	+ Signals sent out and received meanings manipulated
	+ Reframing communication as navigation
* Focus on contemporary talismanic magic in intellectual sphere.


### 9 Knowing Oneself in a Group Mind Dynamic

**Understanding Group Mind Dynamics: Navigating Memetic Networks**

**Group Behavior and Identity**
- Second Life and World of Warcraft: virtual spaces for interaction and bonding through shared stress
- Forming groups enhances decision making based on individual intentions and desires rather than external influences

**Exposing External Influences**
- Successive iterations of remixing, collaging, or manipulating samples to reveal subliminal influences

**Collage as a Technique for Self-awareness**
- Revealing preconscious influences through conscious decision making and creating art
- Engaging in communities of meme sharers accelerates personal evolution

**Importance of Knowing Oneself within a Group Dynamic**
- Understanding individual role, weaknesses, emotional boundaries, and psychological triggers
- Aim for conscious awareness of external pressures and internal influence on group dynamics

**Masterminding: Sustaining Group Energy**
- Manifesting group patterns that focus on specific outcomes
- Mapping individuals within the group facilitates this work

**Understanding Group Dynamics through Psychological Typing Systems**
- Timothy Leary's interpersonal circumplex: a personality compass used in group therapy to categorize individuals in relation to each other
- Balanced groups maintain focus, while unbalanced groups risk destruction or energy loss
- Center of the compass represents group purpose or focus.


### 10 Trans-Media Meme Construction

**Trans-Media Meme Construction: Sigils and Iconography**

**Sigilization**:
- Concept owes a debt to Austin Osman Spare's work
- Also influenced by IKEA's instructional diagrams
- Allows for non-language dependent communication
- Examples: video with graphical thumbnails, audio and olfactory imprinting
- Iconography plays a crucial role in sigilization

**Positive Motivational Triggers**:
- Words/phrases like "You", "Proven", "Guarantee"
- "Make money", "Save money", "Save time"
- "Look Better", "Learn more", "Money", "Save"
- "Results", "Live longer", "Feel comfortable"
- "Discovery", "Be loved", "Love", "Become popular"
- "Experience pleasure", "Health", "Safety", "Easy"
- "New"

**Negative Motivational Triggers**:
- Found in shortwave stations, internet conspiracy theories
- Used by political campaigns to influence perceptions
- Example: fear-mongering news releases from the Bush Administration

**Hyperstition**:
- Sigilization techniques that realize themselves through actions of those who hold the idea-set
- Examples: H.P. Lovecraft's fictional mythos becoming a working occult system, self-fulfilling critical acclaim for artists

**Video and Attention Economy**:
- Saturation of video communication makes events more valuable to attention economy
- Terrorism accelerates meme dissemination through instantaneous coverage and emotional response


### 11 Phagic Repurposing of Existing Memes

**Understanding Meme Propagation through Phagic Repurposing**

**Background:**
- Bodies perform actions based on end goals of adjacent bodies
- Social strata have different reactions to same meme capsid
- Most efficient and effective when aligned with immediate proximity towards same goals

**Meme Propagation Models:**
1. **Phagic Model**: Slowest to influence entire culture, but sustainable over long term
2. **Problem-Reaction-Solution Model**: Fastest, relies on catastrophic change, may not sustain change over time
3. **Linked or Webbed Structure**: Generates paradigm shift when most successful, organic with best pattern integrity

**Meme Plex Development:**
- Introducing a breakthrough technology: marketing, refinement, testing -> expansion stage -> maturity and saturation
- Technology as meme body in action: gadgets or abstract technologies
- Beliefs change, leading to technology revision

**Phagic Repurposing of Existing Meme:**
- Track motivational axis of existing meme
- Position intention askew from motivational axis to redirect meme bearer
- Phage carries new approach to existing technology or solves existing models
- Spread requires an existing meme, transforming behavior of meme-bearer

**Magical Techniques:**
- Sorcery Event Series: Prime Chaos by Phil Hine
- Sigil Web explanation: Space/Time Magic by Taylor Elwood

**First Person Shooter Meme:**
- Repurposing from same cultural pool
- Maintenance of player's attention span crucial for retaining end-users.


### 12 Elements of Memetics

**City as a Giant Information System**
- Cities are complex information systems, similar to brains in their ability to change and adapt
- Natural cybernetic systems process information, leading to physical changes in cities
- Cities have cultural entities that represent them as having a "character" or "spirit"
- These entities can be harnessed for local politics and revealing opportunities

**Meme Theory**
- Meme-signals are important for influencing behavior
- Attractiveness and difference from surrounding signals determine meme spread
- Memes are connected and cluster together

**Designing Meme Signals**
- Physical representations of the signal
- Cognitive principles to bypass defenses
- Emotions evoked and needs promised
- Intended actions in the target

**Meme Layers**
- Shiny, colorful surface attracts the target
- Cognitive exploits help swallow the meme
- Needs-fulfillment helps the target digest the meme
- Ultimate intent is the end result

**Brain and Society Analogy**
- The brain operates like a social structure with neuroplasticity
- Studying swarm intelligence in these structures reveals how individual actions lead to complex behavior

**Misconceptions about Brain as Computer Metaphor**
- Criticism that computers cannot change their hardware like the brain can be addressed by recognizing that modern computers may not yet fully exhibit this feature.


### 13 Science of Marketing and Narration

**Marketing and Narration: Science of Persuasion**
* Rhetoric's purpose is persuasion
* Marketing is a form of persuasion for generating action
* Actions can range from attending events to adopting beliefs
* Set up consistent but incomplete patterns to guide consumers
* Only present necessary information for initiatory action
* Use emotions, needs, and motivators to construct desire circuits
* Build context of sale to solve consumer need-patterns
* Create narrative around product as solution
* Selling is memetic engagement with verifiable transactions
* Understanding brand identification as sympathetic magic
* People buy brands to associate with feelings and meanings
* Brand managers carefully plan image for desired response
* Conscious emotion relates to narratives; unconscious desire works best with metaphoric association
* Advertisements use models to sublimate desires into product associations
* Energy products example: desire for health sublimated into purchasing commodities
* Viral marketing campaigns aim for memetic structures to spread signals widely
* Memetics provides tools to understand how things 'go viral' or 'tip your meme'
* Wider signal distribution leads to greater effect on communication networks
* Connectors act as primary hubs, exposing many people to signals
* Salesmen alter signals for specific audiences, infecting a greater percentage but with risk of distortion.


### 14 Ownership and Self in Networked Spaces

**Cyborgs, Self, and Networked Spaces**

**Myth of Evolution and Cybernetics**
- Commonly held myth: evolution implies our perception of place in culture
- Cyborg is not a robot but a use of cybernetic system
- Flesh and machine, or technical apparatus
- All engage in cyborg behaviors

**Biological Transcendence as Coping Mechanism**
- 'Transcending biology' meme: biological transcendence through technology
- Cyborg technology to transcend behavioral and belief limitations
- Emerge from the intersection of a multiplicity of minds

**Emergence of Persons in Larger Minds**
- Individuals are parts of many different larger minds (egregores or masterminds)
- Egregore not fully in control, determined by actions of individuals
- Individuals not fully in control due to system constraints

**Mind and Cyborg Technologies**
- Hardware: machinery
- Software: protocol that dictates performance
- Brain and body are adaptive systems
- Use determines future capabilities

**Consciousness and Metaprograms**
- Self-reflective consciousness: one type of meta-program
- Empathy: another type of meta-program
- Awareness of unconscious programs important for development

**Understanding Unconscious Programs**
- Look for gaps in self-reflexive awareness or journaling
- Identify and observe patterns in behavior
- Sigilize aspect or entity within psyche

**Persona and Preconscious Mind**
- Public self (persona): story created by I
- Factors acting on I: preconscious drives and programs
- Internal motivations require identification for change

**Identifying and Leveraging Components**
- Internal events in preconscious mind are undifferentiated
- Traumatic experiences heavily imprint behavior
- Magicians use aspects of self as individualized entities (servitors)


#### Changing self-programming through input, output, and processing in creative techniques.

**Understanding Servitors: Sigils, Visualization, and Changing Patterns**

**Servitors:**
- Treated as spirits
- Mark DeFrates' essay "Sigils, Servitors, and Godforms" for further understanding
- Use a symbol or name with no pre-existing meaning

**Changing Programs:**
1. Identify triggering context
2. Use techniques like recapitulation
3. Visualize new pattern from trigger to outcome
4. Practice of visualization: internal and external, vividness, intensity
5. Journal or use record-keeping methods (collage, remixing)

**Understanding Self as a System:**
1. Input: easiest factor to effect change
2. Eliminate sources of input that engage with hegemonic status quo
3. Output: hardest factor to control
4. Spend energy in creative production of recorded media (singing, drawing, text, etc.)
5. Review output before new creative session for processing improvement
6. Learn skills related to forms of expression (media criticism, meditation, visualization practice)
7. Broadening range of languages used for complex signification
8. Money as an important complex signifier in contemporary culture.


### 15  InputOutput Balancing

**Input/Output Balancing:**
* Identify what you truly desire: personal or externally imposed?
* Question origins of desires: consequences, benefits (for self or others)
* Mind mapping technique: center topic, draw lines with related concepts, create a spider web-like diagram
* Flowscapes: list subject matter factors, assign letters, determine factors leading into each other, create a map showing relationships between items.
* Balance input and output for intelligent growth
* Dr. Wenger's method: generate ideas freely without self-censorship, select the best
* Internet culture: individual production of media for self and others, feedback loops
* Mastermind groups: formal declaration of intentions, advice sharing, personal goal advancement
* Structured mastermind sessions: equal opportunity to present concerns and provide advice, consistency for synergistic effects.
* Be selective with input, capture output, feed it back to yourself, share the best with a larger audience.
* Declare right to comment on all media entering your life, review, react, release valuable content to others.
* Mastermind groups serve as laboratories for memetic construction through group dynamics and individual unique contributions.


### 16 Larger Group Dynamics

**The Mayan Control System and Time-Binding**
* The Mayan system was based on principles of time-binding: calendars, festival days, and seasonal changes
* Linear methods of time-binding (e.g., language) increase memory and influence decision-making
* High priests knew affective states and physical conditions, wielding power through prediction

**Modern Time-Binding Systems**
* Science, navigation, business accounting: record and structure data for prediction
* Power lies in the ability to predict occurrences and trends

**Civilization and Domestication**
* Civilization dome sticates animals, shifting focus from capturing individuals to managing herds
* Herders track herd movements and patterns, overlooking individual behaviors
* Domesticated animals are predictable, making them easier to control

**Understanding Control Systems for Freedom**
* Knowledge of rulers' techniques is needed to overcome tyranny
* Use tools of control on oneself: spy on actions, record activities, and create predictions
* Select and censor exposures, associations, and behaviors

**Layers of Organization in Memetic Engineering**
* Linear causative structure of narrative
* Underlying network structure of association
* Cognitive layers of thought and emotion
* Preconscious drives and desires
* Market segment aggregates or individual peculiarities

**Creating Effective Memes**
* Signals must enter human system through senses
* Encoded instructions must be digested by the nervous system
* Communication occurs on subliminal levels for most people
* Fine-tune message based on targeted audience layers

**Techniques to Enhance Meme Ingestion and Transmission**
* Use linguistic or non-linguistic cues to lead receiver through sensory modalities (NLP's representational systems: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory)
* Elicit emotional states and anchor them to messages or symbols
* Communicate incongruently for different parts of an audience
* Trigger disassociative and suggestible states in potential receivers


### 17 Elements of an Egregore

**Elements of an Egregore: The Joker**
* The Joker is an egregore created through collective effort of writers, artists, and readers over last half-century
* Lives in Gotham City (fictional narrative), pages of comics, minds of creators and audiences
* Associations include Batman, past behaviors, continuity in comics
* Egregores are emergent intelligences of an organization and its physical implements
* Manifestation layers: network of relations between people and objects, protocols for functioning, core directive
* Mistakenly focused on as pure spiritual or astral entities while overlooking physical aspects
* Joker exists in cybernetic spaces created by network of nodes (pages, memories)
* Dynamic and cohesive, changing over time while exhibiting a consistent nature
* Comics becoming lingua franca of digital world due to memes' ability to motivate action
* Memes are at conversion point where desire becomes action, appeal to body's needs for spread
* Goal: move meme up "Long Tail" to Early Adopters and Early Majority
* Salesmen and Connectors play role in memetic work by involving Mavens among innovators.


### 18 Internal and External Perceptions of Cybernetic Systems

**Cybernetic Systems and Perceptions:**

**Structures as Constraints**
- Every structure acts as a constraint on behaviors
- Navigating memetic networks: associational proximity
- Intuitive art to navigate shamanic cyberspace

**Communication Theory**
- Linear sequence is an address tracing a path through associative space
- Multiple schemas for mapping social interactions
  - Socionic typology (Socionic or Myers-Briggs Types Index)
    * Favorited due to quick application in short term interactions
  - Interpersonal Circumplex
    * Useful for longer term relationships
- Grounding in experiential details enhances communication impact

**Signal Effectiveness**
- Description of sensory experiences brings immediacy and elicits desired reactions
- Adaptability essential for growth: constraints determine system development direction

**Memetic Influence on Communication Networks:**
- Understanding existing memes in a social space crucial for effective transmission
  - Public and counter-public spheres of discourse
- Flexibility in behavior allows systems to evolve and outmaneuver stagnant ones.

**Language as Restraint**
- Primary programming that controls individuals
- Acknowledging language's restrictiveness is key to moving past it
- Cataloging implications of language to broaden perception.


#### Private language versus public sphere: understanding differing uses of language as technology and its impact on individuals and groups.

**Linguistic Training and Private vs. Public Language:**
* Learning new languages can lead to different assumptions and limitations
* Initiatory experiences often involve adapting to a new set of language and assumptions
* Differentiate between private and public language:
  + **Public Language**: Mutually agreed-upon definitions, effective for influencing or manipulating audiences (binary oppositions, hooks)
  + **Private Language**: Used internally, defined by individual needs (objective description), examples: NLP, E-Prime
* Subaltern counterpublic spheres of discourse enable ideas and discussions impossible in public sphere due to linguistic constraints or political liabilities.

**The Multimind Model:**
* Breakdown of structures and protocols of mental cognition
* **Structures**: Conscious level, small minds (sub-personalities), talents, domain-specific data processing modules, reflexes
* **Protocols**: Sensitivity to recent information, emphasis on vivid or higher resolution information, simplifying by comparison, focusing on meaning and relative valuations
* The multimind allows individuals to retain consistency and continuity, while the mastermind (group mind consciousness) creates a synchronic egregore for focused intent.
* The internet as an extension of the nervous system enables communication between individuals' multiminds and mastermind groups.


### 19 Transmedia Narration and Modular Exposure

**The Blair Witch Project and Transmedia Storytelling**

**Background:**
- The Last Broadcast (1998): documentary-style film about campers in Pine Barrens, first digitally released theatrically
- Inspired ideas for The Blair Witch Project (1999), which became a transmedia hit
- Early use of Internet, search engine optimization, and social groups for marketing

**Transmedia Storytelling Techniques:**
- Generating narrative sequence from online footage
- Low production costs and various devices used: phones, digital cameras, closed-circuit television systems, news footage, webcams
- Overlapping narratives reveal the underlying pattern in film

**Genre Application:**
- Not limited to horror genre; other film genres can also benefit from transmedia storytelling

**Marketing and Film Release:**
- Marketing must be compelling enough to encourage archiving and studying of online footage
- Second and third viewings of the film motivated by marketing and twist within the movie
- Attention is an economy in its own right

**Example:**
- The Usual Suspects (1997) uses non-linear narration effectively.


### 20 Pre-conscious Cognition and the Writer

**Pre-conscious Cognition and the Writer**

**Preconscious Mind**:
- Needs precise goals which it interprets literally
- Retains memetic content indefinitely
- Influences behavior until deliberately altered or removed
- Can be tracked through journal, collage, etc.

**Programming the Preconscious Mind**:
- Requires clear and believable goals with strong emotional resonance
- Goals should be visualized daily to engage imagination
- Celebrating successes is more powerful than affirmations
- Sleight of Mind techniques can encrypt messages for deep mind

**Narrative Magic and Writing**:
- Texts can influence writer and readers through emotional investment
- Comparative mythology and symbology are important in understanding the relationship between text, writer, and reader
- The magic ritual is complete when the text is written and edited
- Writing aims to affect change in the reader through consistent reinforcement of intended effect.


### 21 Not Everything is Equally Interconnected

**The Social Machine and Interconnectedness**
* Society is a machine for human interaction and cooperation (tool/purpose)
* Formed to facilitate human relationships
* Networks are social machines within society
* Interest groups form based on shared topics or goals
* Trust groups form from interconnected interests
* Trusted groups have intentionality and power (masterminds, exhibiting emergent egregores)
* Important to emphasize that not everything is equally interconnected: language barriers, geographical distance restrict access to networks.

**Creating Influence Through Networks**
* Begin with the networks and tools at hand
* Develop from there (not overnight)
* Combine intention and group dynamics for change
* Use techniques like memetic construction, cybernetic engineering, integrity within patterns, and multi-interface communication to increase creativity.

**Simple Steps Lead to Great Changes**
* Change something simple, document the impact on other patterns
* Improve personal growth, professional life, social groups' health and welfare through application of ideas in this text.


### I.  Imaginal Time and the Construction of Sigils

**Occult Arts and Imaginal Time**

**Dangerous Occult Studies**:
- Only dangerous for those with a vested interest in remaining the same
- All things that occur happen within the realm of the natural

**The Occultist's Task**:
- Puzzling out the secret knots by which reality is bound
- Understanding both the mechanics of reality and the mechanism by which the mind can untie or bind new knots

**Satanic Imagery in Magic**:
- Adaptation of satanic imagery to magic is a relatively Christian phenomenon
- Supplication to saintly or divine force is just as magical
- Transubstantiation is social acceptable form of cannibalistic theater

**The Soul and Personal Growth**:
- The soul one possesses is determined by the path one walks
- Altering one's course requires sacrificing who one is to become or embodying a greater archetypal force

**Knowledge and Ignorance**:
- Knowledge, information is a new ordering or reformation of ignorance
- Ignorance can be thought of as a formless void, a place of not-yet-known

**Imaginal Time and Shadow Reality**:
- Imaginal time, the shadow reality, is the arena where math occurs
- This shadow time exists parallel to our physical reality
- 2+2 can equal different values in this imaginal time

**Perfect World of Forms**:
- The perfect world of forms is the idea that there's only one of any group of like things, existing in the mind alone
- Imaginal time occurs in this perfect world of forms

**Sigils and Magic**:
- Sigilic techniques can be used to directly apply magic to the energy of the unmanifested
- Certain substances can place individuals into a state where they are effective magicians
- Techniques for achieving these states can be found in magical texts

**Cultural Propaganda War**:
- History is the history of conflict between worldviews, culturally applied to geography
- Within each worldview, there are aspects held apart from common life, and keepers of the calendar are the society's mages.


#### Magic: Creating Meaning through Sigils and Intensive Thought.

**Astrology and Magic:**
- Ancient astrology rooted in environmental factors and psychological understanding
- Lifestyle of average astrologer was key to exploration
- Questioning the meaning behind celestial events
- Cultures built around bioregions, calendar, and ritual sequences
- Social duty of mage is to unlock wisdom into internal understanding
- Ecstatic states facilitated new mythic resonances in worldwide culture

**Knowledge Acquisition:**
- Mind learns through various ways
- Knowledge stored as information or memory
- Art of knowing is the art of memory
- Magic requires will, ingenuity, and chastity of purpose

**Sigilization:**
- Seed for physicality of abstraction in magic
- Creates conduits between mage's psyche and external world
- Constructing runic forms through attention and intensive thought
- Mathematics provides a way to understand symbolic sets
- Unique form of glyph is the seed, not an individuated energy form yet.

**Sigil:**
- Intersection of glyph, time of making, energy behind it, and intent
- Symbols are tools for successful willing in magic
- Touchstones for the mind navigating abstractions of shadow time.
