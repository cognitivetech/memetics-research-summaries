# Evolution of Desire: A life of Rene Girard. Project Muse (2018)

> René Girard (1923–2015) was one of the leading thinkers of our era—a provocative sage who bypassed prevailing orthodoxies to offer a bold, sweeping vision of human nature, human history, and human destiny. His oeuvre, offering a “mimetic theory” of cultural origins and human behavior, inspired such writers as Milan Kundera and J. M. Coetzee, and earned him a place among the forty “immortals” of the Académie Française. Too often, however, his work is considered only within various academic specializations. This first-ever biographical study takes a wider view. Cynthia L. Haven traces the evolution of Girard’s thought in parallel with his life and times. She recounts his formative years in France and his arrival in a country torn by racial division, and reveals his insights into the collective delusions of our technological world and the changing nature of warfare. Drawing on interviews with Girard and his colleagues, Evolution of Desire: A Life of René Girard provides an essential introduction to one of the twentieth century’s most controversial and original minds - [Evolution of Desire](https://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Desire-Studies-Violence-Mimesis/dp/1611862833?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

### Chapter 1. Introduction

**Chapter 1 Introduction**

**Heinrich Schliemann's Discoveries**:
- Schliemann used the Iliad to find Troy in 1871
- He found the lost city of Troy in 1873, despite being criticized as an amateur, adventurer, and con man
- His methods were considered outdated, but he is credited with discovering prehistoric Greek civilization
- He ignited the field of Homeric studies at the end of the century

**René Girard's Scholarship**:
- Like Schliemann, Girard trusted literature as the repository of truth and an accurate reflection of what happened
- His scholarship spanned various disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, history, philosophy, psychology, and theology
- Girard overturned three widespread assumptions about the nature of desire and violence:
  - That our desires are authentic and our own
  - That we fight from differences, rather than sameness
  - That religion is the cause of violence, rather than an archaic solution for controlling violence
- Girard's work on "metaphysical desire" and "mediated desire" (the desire to adopt others' desires) has had a significant impact on various fields
- His theory of mimetic desire as the key driver of human behavior and conflict has been influential, particularly in explaining the root causes of violence

#### René Girard's early life, meeting Martha McCullough, and untouched dissertation.

**Girard's Memoir Reflections:**
* Girard was attracted and annoyed by "the American way of life" and its self-confidence
* He found it difficult to write about these things with justice, wanting to write "avenging pamphlets" but realizing the subjects were mediocre
* The young Girard resembled the Underground Man from Dostoevsky's works
* Preoccupied with others' opinions and a sense of inferiority
* He wrote about the Underground Man maintaining an appearance while masking his own deficiency
* Pride increases when transcendence is given up, leading to a stumbling block

**Martha McCullough:**
* Martha was a young student during Girard's second term teaching at Indiana University
* She had tough life experiences that fostered her early maturity and practicality
* Her father died when she was 17, leaving her family with hardships
* Martha earned high academic grades, including a 4.0 GPA in her first semester
* She was recruited to Delta Gamma despite the expenses being beyond a fatherless student's reach
* Colleagues remembered her as beautiful, cool, and full of common sense
* Contrasted with Girard's unpretentious good sense and hospitality

**Their Relationship:**

#### A young scholar's introspective dissertation on French-American relations, marriage, and the study of Rene Girard.

**Girard's Dissertation and Early Life**
- **Polished but uninspiring dissertation**: 418 pages, substantial effort for a 26-year-old instructor
- **Preoccupation with French-American relations**: wondered what "natives" might think of him and the French language
- **Investigation method**: wrote to French ambassador in Washington for newspaper clippings
- **Dissertation topic**: France's "national propensity of finding a scapegoat for their sins"
- **Future study focus**: Franco-German relations, centerpiece of final book "Battling to the End"
- **Academic training**: historian, self-taught in literary criticism and other fields
- **Marriage to Martha**: simple wedding, opposed stereotypical 1950s standards

**Martha and René's Wedding and Honeymoon**
- **Intimate ceremony**: attended by family and close friends
- **Honeymoon in Mexico**: expected Tampico but preferred Mexico City instead
- **Stolen car incident**: remembered as an adventure, not a setback
- **63rd anniversary**: celebrated with no grand gestures, just simple moments of tenderness between René and Martha.

#### Early influences on Girard's work: Historical relativism, Malraux, art, existentialism, academic rejection.

**Girard's Influences: Perse and Malraux**

**Perse:**
- Historical presence in Girard's work praised (1953)
- Ideas, not language or music, caught his attention
- Quote: "Civilizations appear as worlds that cannot communicate with one another. They come into being, live, and die, only to be replaced by others just as ephemeral and isolated as they were. There is no more absolute; man is condemned to the relative."

**Malraux:**
- Major influence on Girard
- Historical relativism as a theme of despair in Malraux's works, including "Walnut Trees of Altenburg"
- Quote: "The greatest mystery is not that we have been flung at random between this profusion of matter and the stars, but that within this prison we can draw from ourselves images powerful enough to deny our nothingness."
- Malraux's art theory influenced Girard through his work "La Psychologie de L’ Art" (1947–49)
- Quote: "The devil, who always prefers to paint in two dimensions, has become the most eminent of the artists of the unknown past; nearly all that he has contributed to painting has come back to life."
- Malraux's critical reception and public censure motivated Girard

**Girard's Response:**
- Discovered meaning in words despite academic challenges
- Tenured position awarded to another Frenchman, Robert Champigny, spearheaded by Samuel Will
- Repented of neglecting academic demands and began writing around 1950.


### Chapter 5. Mankind Is Not so Kind

**Mankind Is Not So Kind**

**The Play "The Respectable Prostitute"**:
- Written by Jean-Paul Sartre
- Opened on Broadway in 1948
- Controversial due to its themes of racial prejudice and lynching in the American South
- Focuses on a black man accused of a crime he did not commit, and the impending lynching

**The Scapegoat Role**:
- The black man takes on a "totemic role" - not just a guilty mortal, but a supernatural harbinger of bad things to come
- This scapegoat role is a pretext for what unfolds in the drama

**Sartre's Experience in America**:
- Toured America as a guest of the U.S. State Department in 1945
- Observed rampant racial prejudice and segregation, especially in the South
- Published "What I Learned about the Black Problem" in Le Figaro after his return

**Girard's Experience in the South**:
- Spent a year in North Carolina from 1952-1953
- Described the "prodigious floral explosion of the spring, the paradisal aspect of its suburbs"
- But also noted the "overwhelming heat" and the "racial malaise that always hung over this country"
- Witnessed the segregated waiting rooms, bathrooms, and other public spaces

**Lynching**:
- A "told and untold story" - well-documented but largely unknown to those born after the Civil Rights era
- Represents the violence that held a social order in place, erupting occasionally to reveal the truth beneath the surface


#### Silence and lynching experiences: Girard's untold story of racial divide

**Duke University's Segregation History**
- Separate bathrooms and sections reserved for "coloreds" at Wallace Wade Stadium (1948)
- Divinity School students petitioned for more inclusion, but it took decades for change:
  - First black graduate student admitted over a decade later
  - Black undergraduates enrolled fi fteen years after petition
- Simone Weil's Experience in New York City and Harlem
  * Moved to Upper West Side apartment on Riverside Drive, near Harlem (1948)
  * Explored Harlem, attended Baptist church, gospel preaching, spiritual singing, and daily mass at Corpus Christi
- Silence on Racial Divide and Occupied Paris
  * Girard's experience with racial divide not elaborated in his work
  * Friend suggested Girard had mentioned witnessing a lynching in the South but could not confirm

**Girard's Alleged Lynching Experience**
- Oughourlian, Girard's friend and collaborator, claimed Girard once mentioned witnessing a lynching
  * Context referred to scapegoats
  * Only time he made such a statement
- No follow-up questions from Oughourlian or others
- Some colleagues doubted the story, while others believed it was possible
- Lynchings not necessarily spontaneous events; some planned and advertised in newspapers
  * Attracted large crowds of white families.


#### Exploring the history of American lynchings and their connection to Girard's theory on scapegoating and social cohesion.

**Lynchings in America: A Paradoxical History**

**Background:**
- Men dressed up for celebrations during racial violence against blacks in the South
- Children played while adults tortured victims
- Grisly souvenirs made from body parts and postcards distributed
- Newspapers reported events, but used "alleged" to indicate accusations, not proven judgments
- Historical accounts of this time reveal societal expectations of racial hierarchy

**Search for a Pivotal Moment:**
- Oughourlian suggested the South as pivotal moment in Girard's theory on scapegoating
- Jameson, a literary critic, couldn't recall what Girard meant by this connection
- Girard later denied this claim, but also acknowledged Faulkner's insights on racial violence and victimization

**Prejudice and Historical Amnesia:**
- Lynchings documented but largely forgotten by general public within a generation or two
- Holiday's "Strange Fruit" lyrics serve as an enduring reminder of this history
- Girard's hypothesis: participants may have felt no need to explain or exonerate themselves.

**Implications:**
- Historical accounts reveal societal expectations and prejudices that persist today
- Understanding the roots of racial violence is crucial for addressing its lasting impact.


#### Violence and Sacred vs. Critique of Dialectical Reason: Two Philosophers' Perspectives on Mob Violence and Scapegoating

**Impact of Denial and Self-Justification in Murder**

**Historical Perspective**:
- Meticulous record-keeping in notorious regimes
- Participants had no sense of wrongdoing
- Scapegoat mechanism breaking down but still present

**Technological Advancements and Lynch Mobs**:
- Easy for individuals to lynch morally, symbolically, physically
- Shaming on social media as a form of "symbolic lynching"
- Technology has made it easier for people to form mobs and enact violence

**Jean-Pierre Oughourlian's Observations**:
- People easily lynch others, both morally and physically
- Technological advancements have increased the prevalence of lynching behavior
- Lynchers see their actions as defending themselves or the community

**René Girard's Perspective**:
- Witnessed racial injustice and violence in America
- Developed theory on scapegoating and sacrifice through studying literature
- Recognized the serious consequences of mimetic behavior

**Sartre's Philosophical Treatise**:
- Endorsed violence as a bond of love between lynchers
- Saw lynching as a "practical bond of love" and "brutal re-actualization" of group unity
- Believed individual conscience is diminished when people enact the will of a group


#### Girard's life and work: Exploring the connection between literature and truth, sacrificial violence, and personal experiences.

**René Girard's Perspective on Judeo-Christian Texts and Sacred Violence**

**Girard's Background:**
- Born in Beirut, came to France at age ten
- Mother was from Bogota, father a refugee
- Speaks six languages: Spanish, English, French, Arabic, Armenian

**Girard's Perspective on Judeo-Christian Texts:**
- Remained "hostile" to these texts for a long time
- However, his writing shows an evolving understanding of the sacred and sacrifice before his conversion
- Girard drew connections between literature, especially novels, and history

**Girard's Thoughts on Lynchings:**
- Believed they were archaic religious acts
- Compared them to Faulkner's works for insights into the truth
- Argued that novels reveal underlying societal and psychological schemes not captured in historical records

**Girard's Personal Experiences:**
- Descendants of his grandfather and most of his family were killed during the Armenian genocide
- His father grew up in Lebanon as a French territory due to the violence
- Oughourlian himself has not written about the most important experiences in his life, stating "Mankind is not so kind"

**Girard's Conversion:**
- It is unclear when Girard converted, but he had been exploring the sacred and sacrifice in his writing for years beforehand
- He did not receive any special exemption from violence; he was a witness to it, whether directly or through stories told by others.

- Donato was passionate and energetic, increasing Girard's recognition
- Macksey described Donato as "a junior person in a very senior department," but a "game changer"
- Donato's polemical nature contrasted with Girard's lack of academic battles


#### René Girard's work on imitation and desire in literature and human nature.
**René Girard's Work and Influence**

**Girard's Personality**:
- Cool and measured nature
- Attracted to people of passionate nature (e.g., Freccero, Donato)
- Least needy person encountered
- Loves everyone, but no "great loves" in his heart

**Approach to Girard's Work**:
- Secondary sources and interpretations cannot match the rhetorical command and confidence of Girard's writing
- Recommended reading: **"Deceit, Desire, and the Novel"** rather than secondary sources

**Girard's Perspective on Imitation and Mimesis**:
- Imitation is inescapable, as we learn by imitating others
- Metaphysical desires are based on what we imitate, revealing our ontological sickness
- **Mimesis**: the usage popularized by René Girard
- Romantic lie: myth of personal autonomy and "authentic self"
- Protagonists in novels aspire to freedom but are not truly free, as they worship mediators and adopt their desires

**Types of Mediation**:
- **External mediation**: mediator exists outside the hero's world, remote idol
- **Internal mediation**: mediator is alive and within the hero's sphere, leading to rivalry and obsession

**Impact of Girard's Work**:
- Reaches beyond literature to discuss psychology, cultural problems (fashion, advertising, etc.)
- Signature writing style: formal yet engaging, erudite, incisive, masterful
- Addictive for some, but challenging to read due to complex arguments and intellectual footwork


#### A literary analysis exploring the concept of mimetic desire in works by Cervantes, Stendhal, Proust, Dostoevsky, and Flaubert, with commentary on Girard's focus and potential omissions.

**Girard's Analysis of Literature: Deceit, Desire, and the Novel**

**Key Insights:**
- Girard analyzed a select group of authors (Cervantes, Stendhal, Proust, Dostoevsky, Flaubert) for their understanding of mimetic desire in literature.
- These authors saw the problem of mimetic disease and found antidotes through self-awareness and acknowledgement of desires.
- Girard's focus on specific authors may leave some out in the cold; however, he claims all great literature follows this pattern.
- Some critics argue that Girard was cherry picking or focusing only on certain genres, but his work extends beyond Proust to Camus, Sartre, Kafka, and Beckett.

**Girard's Approach:**
- Aligns himself with antiromantics in rejecting modern nihilism.
- Rejects the belief that spontaneity, autonomy, and originality are new values for emancipated man.
- Discovered false promise of metaphysical autonomy and took desire to continue pretending God is dead.
- Analyzes how heroes in novels imitate each other while pretending to believe in spontaneity.

**Misconceptions about Girard's Work:**
- Some accuse him of being doctrinaire or applying his theory too universally, but he does not insist mimetic desire is the only dynamic at work.
- Misunderstandings may result from his bold language and the need to assert ideas strongly in French intellectual circles.
- Girard focuses on human endeavors where mimesis is prominent but acknowledges it's not the only thing in life.

**Implications:**
- Deceit, Desire, and the Novel offers insights into how literature reflects our fears of false terrestrial gods and the human need for vertical transcendence beyond horizontal fixation.


#### Girard's literary analysis of deceit, desire, and the novel; influences from Stendhal, Sartre, and Dante; criticism from Poulet.

**Girard's Discoveries in Deceit, Desire, and the Novel**

**Background:**
- Girard's insights from Avignon reading influenced by Kipling's Jungle Book, children's Don Quixote, Proust, Stendhal
- Initial cynical approach to writing the book
- Early influences: Sartre's notions of mauvaise foie, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Dante

**Inspiration and Influences:**
*Stendhal*: Girard defended in 1954 against attacks by Paul Valéry
*Dante*: Understood envy as root of evil; imitation can lead to good; spiritual quest
*Phenomenologist Max Scheler's Das Ressentiment: "Man possesses either a God or an idol"
*Georges Poulet*: pioneered criticism of consciousness, influential in Girard's work

**Writing Deceit, Desire, and the Novel:**
- Approached cynically but underwent personal transformation
- Discovered authors' discoveries of mimetic desire
- Influenced by Sartre's ideas on bad faith (mauvaise foie)
- Understood connection between Dante and Proust

**Reactions to the Manuscript:**
- Leo Spitzer suggested connection with Scheler's Das Ressentiment
- Macksey urged Girard to show manuscript to Georges Poulet for endorsement.

**Poulet's Response:**
- Saw Girard's work as an intrusion into the author's life
- Hated Freud and saw theory as a variation on psychoanalysis
- Intemperate letter discouraged Girard initially but later inspired personal growth.


#### Girard's critique of literary aesthetics and exploration of imitation in Dante and Camus

**Girard's Reaction to Critics**
- Girard wanted Poulet's reaction to his book because it was a reaction against Poulet's aestheticism
- Girard saw his book as a challenge to critics who viewed literature as a "world of its own" detached from society
- The letter from Poulet became a source of revelry and humor among Girard's lunch companions

**The Novels in Deceit, Desire, and the Novel**
- These novels end without providing a roadmap to the future
- Protagonists renounce their delusions, leaving unsatisfying conclusions for critics
- Dante's Divine Comedy offers an ultimate ending, while Girard was interested in Dante's depiction of imitation

**The Story of Paolo Malatesta and Francesca da Rimini**
- The story of the two lovers has been heavily marketed as a romantic ideal
- Girard saw the love as a "hysterical, derivative thing born of a book"
- Literature becomes an imaginary map for desires, leading to their downfall

**Girard's Influence from Dante Scholars**
- Girard was surrounded by Dante scholars who were influential in his thinking
- He reasoned he would never excel these scholars and did not write more on Dante
- However, his essay "By Literature Possessed" reveals the influence of Dante and other thinkers

**Girard's Analysis of Camus**
- Girard traced Camus's spiritual trajectory between L'Étranger and La Chute
- He saw Camus's early protagonist Meursault as an aimless "modern hero"
- Girard criticized the nihilistic individualism in Camus's work, arguing it was against nothing in particular


#### Discussing Camus' "The Stranger" and Dostoevsky's influence on Girard's work

**René Girard's Analysis of Albert Camus' L’Étranger (The Stranger)**

**Structural Flaw in L’Étranger**:
- Without the murder, there would be no trial and no judgment
- Meursault's execution has nothing to do with his behavior or personal qualities
- If supernatural necessity is present, why is Meursault alone subjected to it?
- Different characters are judged by different yardsticks in the novel

**Camus' Perspective**:
- Camus' writing is persuasive, as readers trust Meursault's story of himself
- Camus may not have separated the truth about Meursault from his own experiences
- Camus' characters are no longer self-justifications but alter egos for his psychological states

**Dostoevsky and Resurrection from the Underground**:
- Dostoevsky's novels embody his exorcism of demons and new conversions
- The need to discard the Manichean image of evil opposing good will
- The devil as a liar and father of lies, tempting and seducing us with desires

**Joseph Girard's Declining Health**:
- Joseph Girard was dying of prostate cancer
- He could no longer climb stairs or visit his office at the Palace
- He returned to the past in his memories as he approached the end


#### Girard's Family Tragedies and Academic Success: Struggles, Reconciliation, and Rivalry.

**Girard's Experiences**

### Chapter 7. Everything Came to Me at Once

**René Girard's Conversion Experience**

**Background:**
- René Girard was a French literary critic and scholar who underwent a profound conversion experience around the age of 35.
- The event occurred as he was finishing his book "Deceit, Desire, and the Novel."
- His description of this experience has been called "difficult," "embarrassing," and "dangerous" by some scholars.

**The Dark Wood:**
- Girard experienced a state of spiritual confusion similar to Dante's "dark wood" in Inferno.
- He recognized he could not pass the beasts (leopard, lion, wolf) representing disordered passions and desires unharmed.

**Altered States:**
- While traveling by train between Baltimore and Bryn Mawr for a class, Girard experienced "altered states."
- These states continued with more or less intensity for several months.

**Impact on Deceit, Desire, and the Novel:**
- Girard's conversion experience changed his understanding of the authors he wrote about in this work.
- He saw that they were describing how they were being freed from their own mediated, "triangular" desires.
- This led him to rewrite the conclusion and other passages in the otherwise completed book.

**New Understandings:**
- Girard's new understandings enabled him to reach these authors on their own terms.
- The novels he described were not just two-dimensional but had to be lived out in his four-dimensional life.

**Reactions to the Change:**
- Some of Girard's friends were surprised by his conversion, as they perceived him as a leftist and anti-clerical Frenchman.
- Nathan Edelman, a French Jew, described it as an "external kick" that forced Girard into this change.

**Description of the Experience:**
- Girard himself was reticent about the gaudy nature of his conversion experience.
- He said it was a form of intelligence and understanding but also a process that would absorb him for the rest of his days.


#### Personal accounts of transformative intellectual experiences: Descartes, Pascal, and Simone Weil's conversions.

**Revelation and Intellectual Vision**

**Girard's Experience**:
- In 1959, Girard felt he had penetrated into a "mass" of insights
- This experience included:
  - Understanding the nature of desire, imitative behavior, scapegoating, lynching, war, and the ends of the world
  - A sense of certainty and quietness that lasted for years

**Comparison to Other Intellectual Visionaries**:
- René Descartes, Blaise Pascal, and Simone Weil also experienced "intellectual visions"
- This is often unaccompanied by vivid imagery or other external signs
- The enduring effect is a sense of inner poise and direction

**Girard's Approach**:
- He could be sloppy in his work, disinterested in critical questions, and rush to move on to the next phase
- His translations were sometimes problematic
- This may have been due to his belief that he had already uncovered a "single, extremely dense insight"

**Conversion Experiences**:
- Pascal and Descartes also experienced profound conversion experiences
- Pascal was influenced by Jansenism, while Descartes had visionary experiences as a young soldier
- Simone Weil's experience at Solesmes abbey led to her spiritual awakening and influential writings


#### René Girard's Intellectual Conversion: Debunking Mimesis and Embracing Christianity in Literature

**Girard's Personal Revolution: From Debunking to Conversion**

**Girard's Background**
- Recorded experiences in erudite French prose
- Challenged, reasoned, and made intuitive leaps of invention
- Transmitted new understanding through social sciences

**Discoveries from His First Book (Deceit, Desire, and the Novel)**
1. Started with a "pure demystification mode": cynical, destructive
2. Recognized mimesis as a great debunking tool
3. Deprives modern man of individual desire
4. Author's first draft is an attempt at self-justification
5. Focus on wicked hero or 'good' hero
6. Self-examination leads to realization of writer and enemy's indistinguishability
7. Characters are no longer 'Manichaean' good guys or bad guys
8. Writer experiences a downfall, making a great work of art possible

**Impact on Girard's Writing Career**
1. Conversion: intellectual-literary and easier bliss (two-hour train rides)
2. Quasi-mystical experiences on the train during contemplation
3. Discoveries led to a decisive point in writing first book
4. Engagement with Dostoevsky's Christian symbolism
5. Old Verkhovensky discovers he was a fool and turns to Gospel of Christ.

- The doctor eventually found Girard on the sidewalk, waiting for someone
- They began an exploration of the meaning of their encounter
- Each had their own aims: what would they find in each other?

**Working Together**:
- They decided to work together at the Cheektowaga Sheraton Hotel
- **Violence and the Sacred** left behind an untold story
- Girard initially intended for it to be a two-part book
- The part on Christianity was cut as it was taking too long to complete
- **Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World** was about to be written

**Collaboration in Baltimore**:
- Oughourlian brought his wife and child, rented a house and car
- They had a trialogue with another psychiatrist, Guy Lefort
- The collaboration continued for three months, working every day

**Girard's Approach**:
- He was methodical and disciplined in his habits
- He gave Oughourlian two gifts: **irreverence towards canonical authors** and **humor and lightness**
- Together, they clarified Girard's ideas and dared him to talk about the Bible

**Things Hidden**:
- The book had three sections: anthropology, Judeo-Christian scriptures, and interdividual psychology
- It would not have been so controversial if Girard focused on other religious texts
- Even a truth must be fashionable enough to merit consideration in the postmodern world.


#### Jean-Pierre Dupuy discusses reasons for Girard's ostracism in French intellectual circles: religious beliefs, belief in human truth, and identification with Christianity.

**Reasons for Rejection of René Girard's Ideas in French Intellectual Circles:**
- **Reason #1: Belief in God**: Girard openly believes in God, which is seen as a departure from the norm in France where public hatred of religion prevails.
- **Reason #2: Belief in Science of Man**: Postmodernism and other "isms" deny the possibility of knowing truth, making Girard's belief in reaching the truth through science an unpopular idea.
- **Reason #3: Combination of Reasons**: If it's possible to reach truth through God, it contradicts the denial of truth as legal tender in France.

**Impact on Eastern Europe:**
- Girard's works were valuable during Communist era due to their relevance and application against violence and scapegoating.
- His ideas inspired resistance movements like Solidarity (Poland) and Velvet Revolution (Czech Republic).

**Girard's Perception by Colleagues:**
- Benoît Chantre: Structured academic institutions are jealous and Girard's interdisciplinary approach was seen as a challenge to their classification, rituals, and taboos.
- Hayden White: Accused Girard of being medieval and reactionary in his work on Things Hidden.

**Change in Tone and Reception:**
- Things Hidden marked the turning point where some followers felt betrayed due to Girard's previously ambiguous religious stance in earlier books.
- Critics were taken aback by the lack of distance from the subject matter, unlike his previous works discussing anthropological findings.

**Impact on Readers:**
- Some readers were so intrigued that they sought out Girard's interlocutor Lefort despite the unsettling change in tone and the lack of authorial scrim.
- Criticism from academic circles did not deter new fans from being drawn to Girard's theories.


#### Reflections on desire, sacrifice, culture, and violence in human history by Réné Girard. Sacrifice's role in Old Testament and its renunciation through imitatio Christi. The controversial rejection of the notion of atonement for sins.

**Reflections on Desire and Sacrifice by René Girard**

**Desire's Evolution**:
- Desire is responsible for its own evolution
- Desire uses knowledge acquired of itself to serve its untruth
- Desire shares this feature with Lucifer (the devil)

**Scapegoating and Sacrifice**:
- In ancient texts, the Jews began to take the side of the victim
- Sacrifice is justified as the need of a jealous God, but defended with less conviction
- Scapegoating is exposed but not yet renounced

**The Crucifixion and Renunciation of Violence**:
- The Crucifixion reveals the sacrificial mechanism in its brutal totality
- Jesus's death is a consequence of the "intolerable revelation"
- Mirages distort our vision, but we are becoming aware of them
- Nonviolence can be fatal if it is not unanimous
- Imitating Christ's renunciation of violence is the way to break the cycle of violent imitation

**Atonement for Sins**:
- Girard rejected the notion of atonement as a vestige of sacrificial thinking
- The Crucifixion represented a death to end sacrifice altogether, not a sacrificial death
- God is not to be blamed, but rather all mankind, who are constrained to invent an irrational requirement of sacrifice that absolves them of responsibility.

**Girard's Influence and Reception**:
- **Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World** sold briskly in France
- Girard credited his publisher Françoise Verny for promoting the book on television
- Journalist and economist Jean Boissonat became interested in the book and helped promote it.


#### René Girard's book "Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World": Admiration, criticism, and influence from academics and intellectuals

**René Girard's Influence on French Academia**

**Girard's Work:**
- Inspired intense discussion in French academy among Michel Serres, Paul Ricoeur, Philippe Sollers, Gianni Vattimo, Charles Taylor, and others
- Admiration mingled with criticism from some, including Ralph Harper and Frederic Raphael

**Reception of Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World:**
- Critics had reservations about absolute statements, but overall accepted Girard's argument on fusion between violence and the sacred
- Harper praised the book's vision and Christian themes, comparing it to the Iliad and religious figures like St. Francis or author of Imitation of Christ
- Raphael admired its breadth and sophistication, though not typically an enthusiast for its point of view
- Girard lost interest in avant-garde players and academic politics; letters went unanswered
- Attracted more theologians to his ranks, hurting wider reception but not concerning him

**Girard's Approach:**
- Wanted broad audience but first and foremost went his own way
- Welcomed fellow travelers but usually unruffled by defections
- Dismissed by some for focusing on religion in understanding human violence, competition, desire, and need for transcendence

**Comparisons to Hedgehogs:**
- Roberto Calasso described Girard as one of the "last surviving hedgehogs" due to his expertise in developing a system of thought (mimetic theory)

**Criticism:**
- Critics had qualms about the title, interpretation, and perceived grandiosity of Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World
- Some critics raised questions or expressed reservations on Girard's brand of Christianity and sacrificial interpretations in relation to Christ as the lamb of God.

#### Girard's interdisciplinary symposium at Stanford (1981) - Philosophers and Scientists Collaborate

**Girard's Impact on Multidisciplinary Studies**

**Girard's Influence**:
- Attracted interest from various disciplines: sociology, psychology, history, philosophy, religious studies, theology
- Built on base developed in Baltimore and Buffalo
- Peyre warned correspondent about "drowning of literary values" into a "potpourri of pseudo-sciences"

**Girard's Perspective**:
- Not a philosopher, but works with what is
- Not interested in making recommendations or suggesting specific courses of action
- Insights derived from reading, research, and thought

**Disorder and Order Symposium (1981)**:
- Organized by Girard and Jean-Pierre Dupuy
- Explored connections between disciplines previously held separate

- Their approach to intellectual climate contrasted with dominant styles of enmity

**Grand Récit and Philosophy**:
- Represents a "yes we can" concept that is non-postmodern and non-modern
- Both Girard and Serres belong to a generation of grand philosophes and French master thinkers
- Stanford, under Apostolidès, aimed to recruit more high-profile faculty like them


#### Girard's Influence: Academic Resistance, Support, and Transformation

**René Girard's Career and Influence**

**Girard's Vision**:
- Girard had a vision to bring up-and-coming researchers aligned with his interests to Stanford
- This was blocked by the department chair, Apostolidès
- Girard learned about mimesis and power dynamics firsthand from his own failures and frustrations
- His theories were not substitutes for experience but provided a context to make sense of his own experiences

**Girard's Theories**:
- Represented the last in the School of École Française de Sociologie
- In line with Georges Bataille in terms of preoccupation with sacred, sacrifice, ritual, social cohesion, and collective movements
- Apostolidès described Girard as the last representative of this frontier between sociology and psychology

**Academic Reception**:
- Girard's theories have not always been welcomed by academia
- His ideas were often considered "dotty" by some faculty referees
- This made it difficult for students to pursue research on Girard's work without having to explain everything from scratch

**Girardian Networks and Supporters**:
- **Dutch Girard Society**, **COV&R**, **Association pour les Récherches Mimétiques**, and other groups were founded to support the dissemination of Girard's ideas
- Surprising supporters like Peter Thiel, a billionaire cofounder of PayPal, have also supported research on Girard's theories
- This has raised academic eyebrows due to the perceived tension between high-tech wealth and entrepreneurship and scholarly endeavor

**Assessment**:
- Some see Girard as a "sect" in America, attracting disciples, translators, and proselytizers
- However, this transformation may have had a positive effect by releasing Girard from the ghetto of literary criticism and pointing him in new directions


#### Girard's work: Institutionalization, controversy, and spreading influence

**Girard's Development and Impact on Academia**
* Development may have had an "unhappy effect" by over-extending his thought while narrowing it into a "Girardian System" (Anspach)
* Institutionalization and reification of ideas can be problematic for full integration into academic settings
* Girard's Christianity and growing preoccupation with theology led to critical mass shifting to theologians
* Accusations of proselytizing at conferences, creating a "cloistered tradition" of "Girardianism" (Anspach)
* Tough questions for those studying and promoting Girard's theories: how much to bend to accommodate cultural gatekeepers?
* Mimetic phenomenon in attempt to do so, sending one careening into opposite extremes
* Unrealistic to stick with small, quiet personal "aha" experience in today's world of consumerism and mass marketing

**Girard's Influence on Jean-Pierre Dupuy**
* Dupuy was initially unimpressed by Girard's work but later had a life-changing realization after reading Deceit, Desire, and the Novel
* Discovered his personal problems were instances of general rules governing human condition (Dupuy)
* Integrated Girard's theories into public forums through casual aside from podium, giving new audiences a hearing
* Behind-the-scenes work: meeting with George Soros, discussions with Bernard Maris (prominent French economist and journalist)

**Girard's Perspective on Anthropology vs. Theology**
* Believed texts talk about reality and real events, not just creating a Third Testament
* Radical interpretation of Christian message vulnerable to claims of gnosticism
* Increasing preoccupation with close reading of Biblical texts revealed truth of human existence (The Scapegoat)
* Persecutors in "persecution texts" are naive, unable to cover traces of their crimes.


#### René Girard's later works on New Testament and Satan's role in mimetic desire. Excerpts from Modern Language Notes, Le Nouvel Observateur reviews. Discussion of Satan as the principle of disorder and violence. Questions about universal applicability of Judeo-Christian teachings.

**Girard's Works: New Testament and I See Satan Fall Like Lightning**
* Second half of book addresses New Testament
* Retraces ground covered before in a more accessible way
* Focuses on key texts: beheading of John the Baptist, Peter’s Denial, Crucifixion
* I See Satan Fall Like Lightning (published decades later) expands ideas from earlier works
* Less intensive disciplinary focus for general reader
* Published in France as a best-seller
* In US, published quietly by Orbis Books with clerical blurbs
* Macksey's review: Girard is a prophet of our time, ventured into other disciplines
* Unusual that he took on the job himself
* Books allowed his thought to evolve in response to encounters
* I See Satan Fall Like Lightning received attention, including Le Nouvel Observateur article by Pascal Bruckner

**The Impact of Christianity and the Concept of "Satan" in Girard's Work**
* Christianity brought moral imperative to protect weak against strong
* Nietzsche grasped true revolution: concern for victims (slave morality)
* Separated from Nietzsche on strong vs. weak, Dionysian lynching
* Satan as engine behind mimetic crisis, principle of darkness
* Spreader of discord, public prosecutor and executioner
* Expels Satan: foments rivalries, reduces population to hysterical mob

**Girard's Perspective on Christianity and Western Cultural Heritage**
* Judeo-Christianity as fundamental revolution in history
* Question if results limited to Western history and culture?
* Violence and the Sacred considered tribes in Africa, Indigenous peoples, Polynesia, Brazil
* Theotihuacan discussed in Th e Scapegoat
* Vedas an ambitious subject, considered in lectures at Bibliothèque Nationale de France (Sacrifice)
* Hinduism briefly discussed in response to Goodhart's question.


#### Girard discusses sacrificial traditions in various cultures and critiques Bataille's emphasis on literal sacrifices.

**Interview with Mircea Eliade**

**Background**
- Interview with Mircea Eliade by Goodhart
- Discussion on Judeo-Christian tradition and privileging it
- Comparison of ancient Indian texts to Bible

**Eliade's Response**
- Misunderstanding about privileging the Bible
- India's scriptures discuss sacrifice as a solution to violence
- Patterns of dissolving social distinction, mimetic crisis, lynching found in Rig Veda story of Purusha
- Upanishads have anti-sacrificial thrust but remain within sacrificial framework

**Comparison of Religions**
- Buddhism opposes sacrifice but acknowledges its persistence
- Islam remains compatible with certain forms of animal sacrifice
- Traditional Jewish culture ended with Roman destruction of Jerusalem and Second Temple, not a renunciation of sacrifice per se

**Scholarship and Translation**
- Difficulty in generalizing Upanishads as written during specific time period
- Lack of original Sanskrit texts used, relying on Sylvain Lévi's work instead
- Future translations into Asian languages may attract new audiences and scholarship

**Ethnocentrism and Anthropology**
- Criticism of ethnocentrism as a weapon against anthropology
- Importance of mistrusting ethnocentrism but not reducing it to silence
- Bataille's approach to sacrifi ce: human and literal, not symbolic or theoretical.

**Bataille's Thought on Sacrifice**
- Fascination with sacrifi ce and its rituals, grounded in Durkheim and Frazer
- Formation of secret society Acéphale with headless man emblem
- Attempts to recreate human sacrifice, but no one willing to be executioner
- Emphasis on ritual, agonizing death, psychological states it produces
- Problem: reliance on spontaneous combustion moments can lead to self-absorption and indulgence.


### Chapter 12. The New Darwin of the Human Sciences

**René Girard: The New Darwin of the Human Sciences**

**Girard's Presence on Stanford Campus**:
- Encountered a remarkable professor in his 60s with a distinctive face resembling great thinkers like Plato or Copernicus
- Professor had a professorial briefcase and sense of purpose, but was largely unknown at Stanford
- Girard invited the author for conversation on various topics: crowds, current events, his upbringing, religion, political scandals, stock market

**Girard's Thought Process**:
- Believed in the power of imitation and how it forms crowds
- Warned about the instability of societies that lack principles or are purely consumerist
- Embraced reason and the French tradition of enlightenment in his work
- Noted the shift in meaning of "sacrifice" from archaic societies to the Christian era

**Girard's Impact**:
- Expanding group of people researched around Girard's work in various fields
- Colleagues admired him but were reluctant to publicly acknowledge it due to lack of understanding his work
- Another formidable presence on campus with wide recognition in Europe and South America.


#### Exploring René Girard's work: A complex thinker with profound impact and controversy.

**Girard's Impact on Philosophy and Literary Theory**
- René Girard was a towering figure in philosophy and literary theory
- His work is "coherent and edgy" and has intellectual power to irritate and derail normal thought
- He challenged conventional thinking, particularly in the area of violence and civilization
- His ideas evolved over time, becoming more complex internally
- His work may undergo an eclipse but will remain a great and lasting contribution

**Girard's Impact on Criticism and Interpretation**
- Girard's work is both acclaimed and disclaimed by various schools and disciplines
- It inspires renewed examination of the roots and ramifications of humanistic thought
- His insights have been scrutinized by politicians, lawyers, economists, scientists, theologians, anthropologists, writers, and experts from all horizons
- The profound resonance of his voice echoes its fundamental simplicity

**Girard's Thought on Natural vs. Man-Made**
- Girard was exploring ecological issues, building on his earlier work on Oedipus
- He questioned the natural/unnatural distinction in the Thracian plague story from Sophocles' play
- The infection and reciprocal violence are one and the same; human hardship may precede or follow community panic and search for a single culprit to blame.


#### Girard's work on mimesis, plagues, and the human sciences: conflicts, imitation, and mirror neurons.

**Nosos: Plague in Ancient Greece**
* **Plato's perspective**: Internecine wars among Greeks seen as "nosos," or sickness (The Republic)
* **Sophocles' audience**: Wars considered the ultimate sickness of the polis
* **Girard's interpretation**: Plague narratives reveal crisis of violence and sacrifi ce gone wild

**Human-Caused Disasters vs. Natural Disasters**
* **Machaut's narrative**: Mixes natural and man-made disasters
* **Definition of disasters**: Dependent on human perspective, not solely natural occurrences
* **Examples**: Influenza pandemic, cholera, drought, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis

**Mimetic Theory and Evolutionary Theories**
* **Girard's work**: Draws connections between mimetic theory and Darwin's evolutionary theories
* **Memes as units of imitation**: Memetics as a way to explain culture in terms of natural selection
* **Scapegoating in animals and humans**: Similarities in predator behavior and human scapegoating

**Mirror Neurons: Physiological Explanation for Mimetic Desire**
* **Discovery of mirror neurons**: Offer a deep-level physiological explanation for mimetic desire
* **Impact on empathy and language development**: Possible explanations for empathy, autism, and the evolution of language.


#### René Girard's induction into the Académie Française: recognition and humility.

**Mirror Neurons and Mimesis**
* Meltzoff's finding shook developmental psychology: mirror neurons are hard-wired for imitation, including both positive and negative behaviors
* Girard's perspective: mimesis is not inherently good or bad; it can lead to violence but also heroism and devotion to others
* Mimesis offers a key to understanding human relationships and society's formation

**Girard's Theory on Desire and the Other**
* Adams asked if Girard's theory could account for "desire on behalf of the Other" as an excess of desire rather than renunciation
* Girard responded that where there is active, positive desire for another, divine grace is present; avoiding mimesis leads to optimistic humanism

**Mimesis: A Key and a Way Out**
* Mimesis can lead to endless rivalry or escalate into love or violence
* Humans form societies based on the form of rivalry that is endless
* Imagery of Girard waiting for induction into Académie Française reinforces his humility and lack of need for status symbols

**Girard's Induction into Académie Française**
* In 2005, Girard was inducted into the prestigious French academy with a sword and green silk waistcoat embroidered with olive tree branches
* He found the rituals "very bizarre" but wore the uniform out of respect for tradition
* Observations from others: Girard was uncomfortable yet took the ceremony seriously, treating everyone as equals without ostentation.


#### Girard interprets Carré's spiritual experiences as mystical encounters with divine presence.

**Girard's Speech on Father Carré: A Spiritual Drama**

**Background:**
- Family disappointed with Girard's focus on Carré's spiritual life
- Carré described a transformative experience at age fourteen
  - Felt loved by God, called it an "absolute beginning" and "wonderful gift"
  - Lasting impact throughout his life, central to his vision

**Girard's Interpretation:**
- Carré not just a religious or mystical thinker, but a mystic
  - Experience occurred without warning, effort, or invitation
  - Marked by joy and sense of eternity and renewal
  - Divine presence intuition

**Carré's Later Writings:**
- Focused on Neuilly experience
- Frustration with lack of frequent mystical experiences
- Emotional bitterness, spiritual ambition, drought

**Girard's Analysis:**
- Carré clung to holiness dream despite frustration
- Avoided modern descent into anti-Christian nihilism
- Realized his own spiritual struggle in the past, not present or future
- Humility freed him

**Michel Serres's Remarks:**
- Media obsessed with human sacrifice
- Advanced technologies regressing culture back to archaic age of sacrificial polytheism
- Girard as prophet, reinvigorated literary criticism, history, and psychology
- Helped comprehend mechanisms of desire and competition in economy.


#### Girard's friendship with Schwager influenced his perspective on sacrificial language in Christianity. They debated the meaning of "sacrifice" and its transformation in religious contexts. Girard later admitted he had dismissed Hebrews too quickly and recognized the importance of personal conversion in understanding mimetic theory. Their letters explored the concept of sacrifice, with Schwager arguing that it could be found within the self in imitation of Christ. Girard's stance became more orthodox as a result of this encounter.

**Girard's Conversion Process**

**Background:**
- Girard named "new Darwin of human sciences" by a professor in the early 1970s
- Friendship with Raymund Schwager led to changes in his thinking and work direction

**Correspondence and Influence**:
- Schwager's letters inspired Girard on various aspects of mimetic theory, particularly sacrifi ce
- Discussion about the Epistle to the Hebrews and its meaning of "sacrifice"
- Girard acknowledged being wrong in dismissing the epistle too quickly and apologized for scapegoating it
- Schwager's influence helped Girard become more orthodox in his views

**Impact on Work**:
- Focus on personal conversion and sanctity instead of novelty or unorthodoxy
- Emphasis on prayer to avert disaster
- Difficulties with title translation for last major book, Achever Clausewitz

**Girard's Conversion Process Continues:**
- The friendship between Girard and Schwager changed the direction of his work significantly.
- Their discussions on sacrifi ce led Girard to reconsider his previous dismissal of the Epistle to the Hebrews.
- Schwager's perspective helped Girard understand that the meaning of "sacrifice" had changed over time and was not just limited to primitive religion.
- The influence from Schwager motivated Girard to be more orthodox in his views, even if it meant going against some fashionable intellectual circles.

**Later Developments**:
- In mid to late 1980s, Girard expressed the need for personal sanctity as a response to cultural crisis
- His close friend Gil Bailie recalled Girard's dire assessment of the world situation and his call for prayer during a lecture in Paris.

**Translation Challenges**:
- Difficulties in translating the title "Achever Clausewitz" into English
- The closest translation might be "to fi nish off" or "to complete," but both make for clumsy renderings.


### Chapter 13. Who Asks about the Souls of These Men

**Suzanne-Agathe Deloye's Life and Execution**
* **Background:**
	+ Born on 4 February 1741 in Sérignan-du-Comtat
	+ Daughter of Joseph-Alexis Deloye and Suzanne Jean-Clerc
	+ Fourth of eight children
	+ Lived with brother, teaching grammar, sewing, and catechism
* **Arrest and Charges:**
	+ Imprisoned for two months in a house adjoining the cathedral
	+ Accused of being an enemy of liberty, trying to destroy the Republic
	+ Refused to take mandatory civic oath of loyalty
	+ Previously forced from Caderousse Abbey with nine other nuns
* **Execution:**
	+ Faced the guillotine along with Abbé Antoine Lusignan
	+ Executions signaled by drums and cries of "Vive la Nation"
	+ Thirty-two locals, including Suzanne-Agathe, were executed in Orange during a six-week period

**Girard's Connection:**
* Girard is a distant great-aunt on his maternal grandmother's side through the Deloye family
* The De Loye family has been in the silk business since 1770
* Girard's mother, Marie-Thérèse de Loye Fabre, was born a century after these events and may have passed down family lore about Suzanne-Agathe.

**Impact of Historical Events:**
* Collective persecutions committed by mobs and legal executions fueled by public opinion during the French Revolution
* The Reign of Terror was especially bloody in Orange, where 332 locals, including the martyred Carmelite nuns, were executed.

**Girard's Perspective:**
* Believes Suzanne-Agathe's defiance of the regime's "escalation to extremes" and personal "non" to coercion and intellectual fashion are traits that can be passed through generations.
* Attachment to this history may have influenced Girard's work and final book, Battling to the End.

**Mimetic Desire:**
* Communities subject to disturbances that spread contagiously through mimetic desire
* As conflict grows, it threatens to destroy the entire community even if the object disappears.


#### Scapegoating in the French Revolution: Mimetic violence and sacrificial escalation.

**The French Revolution: Scapegoating and Sacrifice**

**Case Study**:
- The French Revolution provides an illuminating case study of scapegoating and sacrifice
- This mimetic pattern would reverberate through successive centuries of revolutions, world wars, and international terrorism

**Social Distinctions Dissolved**:
- Taboos were gone, social distinctions became much more permeable
- Anyone could become an informant, revolutionary, or executioner of the once-great and inaccessible

**Victims and Scapegoats**:
- The term "victim" has a new meaning than in archaic societies
- Scapegoats are not always innocent, but the blame they carry is disproportionate to their guilt
- Perpetrators home in on them with a single-minded fury and incoherent motives

**The Martyrdom of Suzanne-Agathe**:
- In 1793, rumors of impending invasion brought riots and bloodshed
- Priests and nuns figured prominently among the thousands gruesomely drowned in the Loire near Nantes
- Over 250,000 men, women, and children were killed in the Vendée region

**Modern Parallels**:
- The consequences of the French Revolution are still being played out in the escalation to extremes
- Violence produces only itself, and the fear-driven "kill or be killed" syndrome cannot be explained purely in psychological terms
- Revolutionary factions struggled for control after the condemnation of the scapegoat king

**Propaganda and Promises**:
- The mob demanded more, even as human sacrifices were made to fulfill mimetic aspirations
- These moves only bred more fear and dissension, failing to provide the cement of social unity


#### French Revolution: The Reign of Terror and its aftermath - Robespierre, calendar changes, Cults of Reason and the Supreme Being, and Clausewitz's encounter with war.

**French Revolution: The Reign of Terror**

**Revolutionary Leaders Turn on Each Other**
- Jacobins executed Girondins after October 1793, launching the Reign of Terror
- Need for "purification" required sacrificing others
- Robespierre, an influential figure during this time:
  * Believed people were fundamentally good
  * Launched program that killed up to 40,000 in less than a year
  - Established new calendar and religious beliefs to promote "direct democracy"
  * Created Cult of the Supreme Being as an alternative to more radical Cult of Reason

**Calendar Reforms and Religious Upheaval**
- New calendar abolished traditional sabbath, established republican holidays
- Churches transformed into Temples of Reason
- Political tussle over religion led to executions of "Cult of Reason" leaders
- Robespierre's fall from power in 1794 and the banning of cults by Napoleon Bonaparte

**Societal Breakdown During the French Revolution**
- Time sequences shortened, leading to increased negative exchanges
- Fear of self-preservation among political factions
- Apocalypse seen as Prussian general's invasion instead of Saint John at Patmos

**Carl von Clausewitz and His Impact**
- Officer candidate during the French Revolution
- Grew up to become a general and military theorist
- Influence on Girard at the end of his life


#### The birth of modern warfare: Universal conscription, revolution, and Clausewitz's On War.

**Impact of Universal Conscription on Warfare**
- **Universal conscription** changed the reality of warfare forever
- Soliders were not mercenaries or volunteers, but entire nations mobilized for war
- Promotion based on merit and revolutionary zeal, dissolving social distinctions
- Clausewitz's theory: War is a continuation of politics by other means

**Clausewitz's Influence on Girard**
- Girard was fascinated by Clausewitz's work as it spoke to the "escalation to extremes" in war
- Believed we are living in an era of transition towards universal conflict
- Saw parallels between Napoleon and Clausewitz's ideas on mimesis and rivalry

**Clausewitz's On War**
- Originally written in 1816, after Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo
- Clausewitz was fascinated by Napoleon's restoration of war's glory despite attempts to attenuate it
- Clausewitz's work provided a radical reinterpretation of history and the role of violence within it.

**Impact of Napoleon on Warfare**
- Napoleon destroyed Prussia in the Battle of Vienna in 1806
- Nursed a fierce hatred and prodigious love towards Napoleon, embodying mimesis.


#### Mimetic Desire: Napoleon's Influence on French Intellectuals, including Girard and Clausewitz.

**Background**
- Clausewitz's influence: Napoleon Complex, fascination with history and heroes
- Stendhal's Le Rouge et Le Noir: Julien Sorel's obsession with Napoleon
- Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov: desire to become a Napoleon

**Benoît Chantre**

- President of Association Recherches Mimétiques

**Working with René Girard on Clausewitz's On War**
- Collaboration in Paris: comparing French text to German original
- Intense, intellectual and companionable conversations
- Deep understanding of Clausewitz's text
- Discovering Girard's autobiographical connection

**Girard's Insights on Clausewitz's Work**
- France's obsession with military history and heroes
- Total war: modern wars are reciprocal, involving more people
- The last soldier will be buried with great ceremony

**Historical Context**
- Napoleonic era: Charlemagne, Napoleon, and their imitators
- Stendhal's influence on French literature and fascination with Napoleon
- Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov's desire to become a Napoleon.


#### Historical analysis of the Rhineland crisis and its impact on the dynamics of war and peace according to Rene Girard's perspective.

**The Darkened Perspective on Clausewitz's "On War"**

**Events of 2001**:
- Aggressor believes they can control violence by setting up defenses, but are actually controlled by it

**Germany and the Rhineland (1936)**:
- Allied forces occupied the Rhineland after WWI, banned German troops
- French forces occupied the Ruhr Valley, suppressed resistance, encouraged separatism
- Hyperinflation, unemployment in Germany; Hitler attempted to seize power
- France wanted to keep what it had acquired from victory, but was dependent on British and American allies
- Germans marched into the Rhineland, violating Versailles Treaty
- Appeasement ensued, leading to war

**Girard's Interpretation of Clausewitz**:
- Defender is the one who wants war; attacker wants peace
- French desire for peace caused the new trend to extremes
- Aron's "On War" interpretation was based on the concept of "absolute war" as a concept, not real war
- Girard aimed to redefine Clausewitz as an apocalyptic thinker, rather than a political one

**Girard's Perspective on Violence and Reconciliation**:
- Renouncing violence is no longer sufficient; we have entered an eschatological age where we can destroy ourselves
- The faith in necessary reconciliation of men is shocking
- Violence leading to thousands or millions of deaths is a "sinister play-acting"
- Escalation to extremes demystifies all reconciliation and illusions based on peace-generating violence


#### Analysis of modern violence and terrorism's complex motivations: Sacralization, conflicting desires, and the challenge to Western rationalism.

**Violence and Sacralization**

- Girard found Hölderlin to be a turning point in his life, as he was reading him during a hyperactive period
- Girard saw Hölderlin as a "kind of saint" along with Proust, Stendhal, and Cervantes

**Hölderlin's Life and Connection to Girard**:
- Hölderlin had a close friendship with philosophers Hegel and Schelling
- Hölderlin was taken to the Autenrieth Clinic in Tübingen, where he was drugged, forced to wear a "facial mask," and subjected to other harsh treatments
- Girard was inspired by Hölderlin's solitude and sense of God's withdrawal from the world

**Girard's Connection to Hölderlin**:
- Girard had previously exposed the "romantic lie," but found redemption in the works of authors like Proust, Stendhal, Cervantes, and Hölderlin
- Girard saw himself reflected in Hölderlin's life and work

**Girard's Later Life**:

- Girard spoke at a conference on "Religion and Violence" in 2002, but Schwager, who had been seminal to Girard's work, died unexpectedly beforehand


#### A personal reflection on the life and passing of Rene Girard, influential French anthropologist, and his belief in the long wait for a new world beyond violence.

**Girard's Life and Works**

**Robert Hamerton-Kelly**:
- Co-founder of Imitatio and senior research scholar at Stanford
- Retired to Portland with his wife in 2010 to be closer to family
- Rediscovered joy in singing
- Died in 2013 from a stroke, leaving behind beloved wife and children
- Last words were the final notes of Mozart's "Ruhe sanft, meine holdes Leben"

**Girard's Collaboration with Chantre**:
- Preparing another book on Pauline epistles together
- Girard told Chantre he would no longer be able to work with him due to health issues
- Their long and happy collaboration had come to an end

**Girard's Declining Health**:
- Experienced a stroke in 2009, which was unimpaired physically but affected his speech
- Became anxious at first, then saw the experience as offering spiritual rewards
- His only concern was when Martha went into the hospital for heart surgery in 2011

**Girard's Rereading Project**:
- Embarked on a project to reread old books, including children's novels and Don Quixote
- Found that the expected pleasure did not materialize

**Girard's Isolation**:
- Became increasingly isolated as age and illness progressed
- His speech became incomprehensible at times, but he retained his "implacable calm"
- Showed signs of understanding despite being unable to participate in conversations

**Girard's Last Book and Eschatological Worldview**:
- Criticized for his eschatological perspective in his last book
- Some dismiss the views as not theologically sound, but Girard saw it as anthropological
- The "long waiting room" of history may be necessary before the new world can be born

**Girard's Advice**:
- "Welcome to the long waiting room... God is taking care of it. Yes, yes."


#### Hölderlin's solitude and the value of inner contemplation amidst modern distractions.

**Hölderlin's Life and Solitude**

**Destiny in a Medieval Town**
- First stay in Germany, found undamaged medieval town on Neckar River
- Hölderlin attended Protestant seminary in Tübingen with Hegel and Schelling
- Close friendship among three eventually dissolved into resentment and silence

**Solitude and Human Contact**
- Solitude and human contact are interconnected
- Rejection leads to intense emotions and swings between ecstasy and despair (Hölderlin's case)
- Solitude can be a precondition for thought, as discussed by Hannah Arendt

**The Dilemma of Solitude in Modern Society**
- Increasingly viewed as anti-social in our society
- Constant connectivity through social media and technology making privacy rare
- Deleting anything seen as a sin, transparency is valued over solitude

**Hölderlin's Solitude: Revealing and Deceiving**
- Wrote letters to Schiller describing his dependence and anxiety
- Seeked solitude from family and friends who neglected him
- Found relief in talking to himself, as described in a note: "Only now I understand human beings, now that I live far from them and in solitude"

**Girard's Perspective on Hölderlin**
- Solitude not only a mark of madness but also a necessary condition for thought
- Girard drew parallels between his own withdrawal and Hölderlin's solitude.


#### Girard's reflections on Hölderlin's madness, spiritual transformation, and Christian faith.

**Girard's Reflections on Hölderlin**

**Background:**
- Girard's late reflections on Hölderlin's state of mind
- Believed Hölderlin did not fully embrace madness, but rather assumed it as an "interior exile"
- Poet's behavior: formal courtesy, long hours reciting works, silence
- Torn between nostalgia for pagan gods and dread of their return
- Seeking refuge in Christianity, identified with Christ as the only one

**Girard's Interpretation:**
1. **Hölderlin's madness**: Deliberately assumed, not entirely real
2. **Excessive formal courtesy and silence**: Signs of an "interior exile"
3. **Nostalgia and dread**: Torn between empty heaven and volcano
4. **Christ as the exit from cycle**: Offering positive imitation and distance from the divine
5. **Imitating Christ**: Avoiding rivalry, thwarting all imitations
6. **Threshold of Kingdom of God**: Breaking down rationalist reflexes
7. **Divine possession through suffering and abjection**: When certain of God's abandonment

**Girard's Theological Understanding:**
1. **One can enter into relations with the divine**: Through distance and a mediator, Jesus Christ
2. **Imitating Christ**: Avoiding rivalry, giving it the Father's face
3. **Positive imitation**: Putting us at the right distance from the divine
4. **Abandoning rationalist reflexes**: Reaching threshold of Kingdom of God
5. **Divine abandonment and possession**: Aeschylus to Simone Weil.


### Postscript Hand in Hand

**René Girard's Perspective on Violence and Pacifism**

**Girard's Background**:
- Not a pacifist, but against violence
- Emphasizes the importance of renouncing violence and its escalation

**Involvement in Nonviolent Political Action Discussion**:
- Participated in a roundtable on nonviolent political action with Mouvement alternatives non violentes
- Paul Dumouchel criticized the group for perpetuating the "victimage mechanism" and engaging in finger-pointing
- Girard's position is evasive, not clearly pro or against pacifism

**Girard's Critique of Nonviolence Activists**:
- Identification of victims can perpetuate rivalries and violence
- Emphasis on techniques and strategies cloaks the desire to win
- Total nonretaliation requires acknowledging one's own violence

**Scapegoating and Violence**:
- **Dumouchel**: Violent people are those who speak of peace, not those who engage in violence
- Perpetrators believe they are the "real victims" and their opponents are "persecutors"
- Nonviolent activism can be "pregnant with new forms of sacralization"

**Girard's Perspective on Victims and Perpetrators**:
- No pure victims, as each oscillates between innocence and guilt
- Rejecting the mob through individual choice, not passive quietism or grand gestures

**Implications of Girard's Thinking**:
- If there is no future, then all choices must be re-evaluated in a different light
- Stripped of mediators, we stand on our own to make piecemeal, particular responses.


#### Reflections on Mimetic Desire, Heroism, and Charity: Clausewitz, Dostoevsky, and Girard. Exploring the influence of heroic temptation and imitation in human behavior. The unattainability of rational models to prevent mimeticism and the importance of inner meditation akin to Christ's teachings as an alternative. Examples from literature and history.

**Clausewitz's Influence on Mimetic Drama**

**Background:**
- Clausewitz was a 12-year-old standard bearer for Prussia, deeply influenced by the culture of heroism
- He became trapped in a lifelong competition with Napoleon, never having met him
- This "heroic temptation" led Clausewitz to an unescapable cycle of mimeticism

**Mimeticism and Rationality:**
- It is difficult to describe a model that remains rational amidst the inevitability of mimetic models
- Attempting to prevent imitation is futile, only geniuses and saints can escape this cycle
- The discovery of "innermost mediation" (imitating Christ) is an essential anthropological discovery for escaping mimeticism

**Post-Christian Era:**
- We live in a post-Christian era, making Girard's resolution of mimetic drama unacceptable
- The ultimate imitatio Christi involves death for the sake of others, not self
- Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov explores this concept through the character Ivan Karamazov and Father Zosima

**Nonviolent Movements:**
- "Non-violence" as a scapegoat to disguise hardness of heart
- The real answer lies in Dostoevsky's emphasis on unconditional love, charity, and memory eternal

**Collective Resistance:**
- Individual resistance to escalation is futile; the only way it might work is through collective action
- Examples include Solidarity, a mass movement that used civil resistance for social change in Poland during the Eastern bloc.
