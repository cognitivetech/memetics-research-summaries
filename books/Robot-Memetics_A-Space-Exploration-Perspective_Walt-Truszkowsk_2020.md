# Robot Memetics A Space Exploration Perspective Walt Truszkowsk 2020

> This book provides a novel perspective on the concept of memetics as applied to the development and evolution of intelligent robots and robotic communities/cultures. It provides a framework for the emergence of a hybrid community of people and intelligent robots collaborating to realize mutual benefits and scientific objectives. It aims to show that as the hybrid community emerges, so does its culture. Once this foundational work is done, the book illustrates the robot memetic ideas in the context of a space exploration scenario based on the development and operation of a human/robot settlement on Mars. - [Robot Memetics_A Space Exploration Perspective_Walt Truszkowsk_2020](https://www.amazon.com/Robot-Memetics-Exploration-Perspective-SpringerBriefs/dp/3030379515?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

### 2 Memes Culture the Internet and Intelligence

**Memes, Culture, the Internet, and Intelligence**

**Introduction:**
- Memes introduced by Richard Dawkins in 1989 as units of cultural transmission
- Originally defined as ideas or behaviors that spread within a culture through imitation
- Impacted by the advent of the Internet and its influence on meme dissemination
- Formally modelable to enable manipulation by non-humans
- Can encode intelligence, leading to dynamic forms of information (intelligent memes)

**Memes:**
- Units of cultural transmission that spread from one entity to another
- Examples: catch phrases, musical themes, scientific ideas, physical actions, sayings
- Transmission mechanisms: verbal communication, written communication, TV, radio, Internet
- Memes act as replicators transmitting ideas within an individual's mind
- Undergo variation, competition, selection, and retention based on their sociocultural environment
- Can evolve according to the same principles as biological evolution

**Characteristics of Successful Memes:**
- Longevity: ability to be stored over time
- Fecundity: capability to make new copies or offspring
- Copy fidelity: accuracy of reproduced copies

**Examples:**
- "Kilroy Was Here" meme: spread during World War II, evolved through various forms of communication and media

**Genes vs. Memes:**
- Genes transmit information from parents to offspring; memes can be transmitted between any two individuals
- Memes replicate and mutate at a faster pace than genes
- Memes propagate within a society at a much faster rate due to their learnability

**Cenes, Prenes, and Darwinian Replication:**
- Cenes: gene or meme stored in a computer
- Prenes: representation of a gene, meme, or cene across multiple mediums (brain, computer)
- Genes, memes, cenes, and prenes have Darwinian replication and evolutionary characteristics.


#### Memes, culture, and the Internet: Survival and evolution of ideas through technology and society.

**Memes, Culture, the Internet, and Intelligence**

**Gene Meme Example**:
- Gene moving into a computer to avoid extinction
- Smallpox eradicated but DNA sequence exists in a computer
- Synthetic biology can synthetically produce DNA sequences based on stored computer data
- Synthetic cell created using synthetic DNA and host cell
- Smallpox DNA sequence still exists as "self-replicating species" in a computer
- Potential for smallpox to re-enter the human race through computer-generated DNA sequences

**Complex Memes**:
- Combination of multiple memes into a new meme
- Can be generated by sequencing or superposition
- Sequencing: consecutive performance of individual memes
- Superposition: combined effect of constituent memes with full or variable influence

**Co-Adaptive Meme Complexes (Memeplexes)**:
- Group of co-adaptive memes replicated together to strengthen each other
- Examples: algorithms, responses to inclement weather

**Memes and Culture**:
- Memes reflect the culture of a community
- Cultural practices transmitted through language, tools, and abstract thought
- Shaped by ethical values of a society
- Ethical memes regulate the propagation of conflicting memes


#### Memetics: Science of Memes as Cultural Replicators

**Memetics: The Study of Memes**

**Introduction to Memetics:**
- Scientific study of meme replication, spread, and evolution [12]
- Overview by Finkelstein on human behavior and military value [7]
- Focuses on information propagation, impact, and persistence

**Memetics Models:**
1. **Biological analogy**:
   - Memes as cultural viruses spreading via social contact [Finkelstein]
   - Passive role for individuals in meme spread [memetics model]
2. **Meme diffusion**:
   - People are devices operated by memes they host [The Meme Machine]
   - Alternative view: humans act intentionally in meme dissemination [Rosaria Conte]

**Formal Definition of Memes:**
- Gunders and Brown Meme Concept (CMC) [10]
  * Memetic engineer: creator of the meme
  * Hook: what attracts individuals to the meme
  * Bait: desired result promised by the meme
  * Vector: medium used for transporting the meme
  * Host: carrier that sent the meme
  * Memotype: actual content of the meme
  * Sociotype: social and cultural environment of the meme.

**Example:** "Kilroy Was Here" meme [WWII]:
- Memetic engineer: James Kilroy
- Hook: Who is Kilroy?
- Bait: Where Kilroy was
- Vector: WWII, ships, freight transportation
- Host: Ships, trucks, other freight transportation
- Memotype: Handwritten messages and picture
- Sociotype: Military personnel.


#### Meme evolution on the Internet: Rapid spread and intentional modifications.

**Meme Spread and Transformation**
* Meme spread: from inside ships to various media (print, electronic) and ultimately the World War II memorial
* Vector changes: from ships to magazines, Internet
* Hosts change: military personnel to general population
* Memotype changes: handwritten note to picture
* Sociotype changes: military to general public
* CMC formula useful for tracking meme's transformation
	+ Changes over time
	+ Effectiveness of hooks and baits
	+ Spread through/between sociotypes
	+ Vector and memotype changes

**Internet Memes**
* Intentional changes by human creativity
* Digital footprint left in medium of sharing
* Rapid culture changes compared to traditional memes
* Popular Internet memes undergo multiple mutations and wide sharing
* "Know Your Meme" catalogs popular Internet memes:
	+ Origin and user-submitted derivatives
	+ Example: BusinessCat meme
		- Started as a picture of cat with tie on, posted on bulletin board
		- Added background and saying
		- Mutations spread quickly, showing speed of meme propagation.


#### Internet's Role in Memes: Rapid Spread and Longevity.

**The Internet and Memes**

**Internet's Impact on Memes**:
- Allows memes to spread quickly across the world
- Contrasts with pre-Internet days when memes were shared through word of mouth, writings, or media
- Pre-Internet memes spread and changed much more slowly due to human-to-human sharing

**Examples of Internet Memes**:
- Cat videos
- Sayings (e.g., "Leave Britney Alone")
- Photoshopped images

**Characteristics of Internet Memes**:
- Easy to copy, modify, and mimic
- Quickly shared with large audiences through smartphones
- Stored on servers and computers worldwide, allowing for long-term availability

**Advantages of Digital Memes**:
- **Longevity**: Information can be stored indefinitely
- **Fecundity**: Easier to spread due to digital communication
- **Copy Fidelity**: Lossless information transfer through digital formats

**Memes Competing for Attention**:
- People become selective about which memes they engage with
- Memes compete to be the funniest, most informative, etc.
- Popular memes have a major influence on Internet and culture

**Memetic Formula for Internet Memes**:
- **CMC formula**: Composition, Meaning, Context (CMC)
  - Example: "Grumpy Cat" meme
    - Engineer: Person who created the image ("Fred")
    - Hook: Facial expression and associated text
    - Bait: Description to make the viewer laugh
    - Vector: Internet (Reddit or Imgur)
    - Memotype: Actual image file
    - Sociotype: Relevant context from other humorous images


#### Intelligent memes: adapting, evolving, and cooperating for optimal propagation.

**Memes, Culture, the Internet, and Intelligence**

**Meme Analysis:**
- Grumpy Cat meme formula: `Grumpy - Cat = memetic engineer`
- Description of meme components: `hook="Fred "`, `bait="It Will Make You Laugh "`, `vector=Internet`, `host=Reddit`, `memotype=figure image`, `sociotype=Humorous Imageboard`
- Usefulness for analysis: tracking memes over time, identifying successful baits and hooks, understanding meme spread patterns

**Intelligent Memes:**
- Benefit from self-promotion and preservation
- Adaptability through genetic or other evolutionary algorithms
- Ability to modify themselves based on community needs
- Create new offspring memes based on their own intelligence
- Traceable pedigree for tracking results and improvement

**Intelligent Memes**

**Overview of Intelligent Memes**:
- Anticipate future needs of a community by analyzing current trends and communicating with other robots to generate new memes that may be useful in the future
- Generate offspring memes that can be simple or complex

**Memes as Ideas**:
- Regular memes represent ideas
- Intelligent memes use this active nature to function as artificial intelligence for computer systems
- Provide knowledge to the computer system through their content, and adaptively change to increase usefulness

**Calculus of Ideas**:
- Memes can be represented mathematically using "generators" connected in a graph structure
- Thoughts are formed from these ideas, which can be complete or incomplete
- Enables operations like comparing ideas, forming abstractions, and collecting ideas into groups to form concepts

**Intelligent Memes and Calculus of Ideas**:
- Similarities between memetics and the Calculus of Ideas
- Memes can be linked together to form more complex memes
- Mapping out the formation of a meme, similar to how ideas are mapped in the Calculus of Ideas

**Conclusion**:
- Overview of memes, the impact of technology on memetics, and the introduction of "intelligent memes"
- Potential for using memes to form ideas and constructions that can be visualized for interpretation and explanation of decision making and intelligence.


#### Robot memes: patterns of knowledge for problem solving and robot culture creation.

**Robot Memes**

**Introduction**:
- Memes as "genes for robots"
- Mechanism for sharing information between people, machines, and robots
- Basis for higher-level intelligence, adaptation, self-awareness, culture in a community of robots
- Can be used to explore new ideas and discover knowledge

**Robot Meme Definitions**:
- Feng: Memes as "instructions for carrying out behavior" modeled as "knowledge memes"
- Winfield: Robot meme as "contiguous sequence or package of behaviors copied from one robot to another, by imitation"
- Memes serve as building blocks for problem solving and passed on through cultural evolution

**Robot Meme Differences from Human Memes**:

- Robots can observe and learn from each other's behavior, even if only part of a complex meme is observed
- Robots should have computer vision capabilities to identify memes and understand intentions
- Observations are affected by robot's frame of reference - may lead to diverse meme pool and creativity

**4.3 Self-Awareness**:
- Robots must be conscious of their state and situational task context to perform memetic learning
- Robots can recognize problems, set goals, and track their own state
- Self-awareness allows for individual and community goal creation, enabling complex culture and learning

#### Robots use memetics for problem-solving and collaboration in space colony infrastructure repair.

**Process of Memetic Propagation in a Robotic Community:**
1. **New Meme Creation**: New memes are engineered and distributed to robots for various tasks.
2. **Solar Array Construction**: Solar arrays at Plannex-A are assembled using memes conveying solar array construction plans and manipulation memes for handling panels.
3. **Damage Assessment**: M12, an M-series robot, identifies damage to a panel in the solar array and tasks C22 and C30 with fetching a replacement panel.
4. **Foundation Repair**: C22 discovers that a foundation leg for the solar array is compromised due to erosion and needs drilling of a new hole for support.
5. **Soil Sampling**: An R-series robot, R2, is dispatched to acquire ground-penetrating radar and penetrometer measurements for deciding on a suitable location for the foundation leg.
6. **Drilling Challenge**: C22 encounters unexpected soil conditions while drilling the new hole, retracts bit, changes technique, and continues drilling to find favorable conditions.
7. **New Knowledge Acquisition**: C22's inquisitive task exploration results in new knowledge suggesting that drill-hole depth should be at least 1 m for effective structural support of the solar array.
8. **Adaptive Learning**: Robots adapt and learn from experiences to improve their performance and problem-solving abilities through memetic learning.


#### Robots optimize charging stations using scheduling algorithms and memetics.

**C22's Autonomic Attributes and Properties**
- Exhibits several autonomic attributes and properties for self-management:
  - Environmental awareness
  - Self-monitoring
  - Self-adjustment
  - Self-configurability
- Gains new knowledge that is shared with other C-series robots and humans in mission control on Earth
- Prompts formulation of new experiments for R-series robots to conduct, verifying consistency of new knowledge and improving understanding of geology at Plannex-A

**R-Series Robots Conducting Geological Surveys**
- Team to conduct geological and soil property surveys throughout broader terrain surface
- Consideration of new knowledge C22 acquired regarding minimum drill depths (1m)

**Solar Array Foundation and Charging Stations**
- Solar arrays are energy source for storage systems at Plannex-A settlement
- Limited number of charging stations for robots in the beginning of settlement's establishment
- Smaller E-series robots need 1 hour to fully charge, larger C-series robots require up to 4 hours
- Crowding at charging stations becomes a problem as robots forced to wait in queues to charge batteries

**M-Series Robots Developing Solution for Charging Station Optimization**
- Recognizing the cause of scheduling setbacks is due to time spent waiting for an available charging station
- M102 identifies the problem as an issue related to lack of scheduling organization and prioritization
- Searchs through memotypes in meme pool for relevant memes on scheduling optimization and prioritization
- Evaluates memes generated based on battery charging/discharging rates for each robot species
- Processes relevant memes and develops multiple proposed solutions by combining concepts from the relevant memes.


#### Robot community optimizes charging scheduling through memetic solutions and adaptations.

**Charging Priority Scheduling**

**M102's Role**:
- Derives charging priority schedule for robots based on mission schedules and battery requirements
- Attempts to optimize time spent at charging stations considering mission importance and battery usage

**Observed Inefficiencies**:
- More charging stations would lead to more efficient use of time by robots at charging stations
- Prioritizing charging according to mission task priority led to longer delays in less important tasks
- Delays in lower priority tasks negatively impacted overall mission efficiency

**M102's Response**:
- Revisited and tweaked the charging-schedule meme to improve overall mission efficiency
- Performed simulations to rebalance priority assignment for different robots based on species and mission schedule

**Additional Solutions Suggested by M200**:
- Add more charging stations to alleviate the problem further
- Dynamically relocate charging stations based on mission schedules and topography for increased efficiency

**Implementation of Solutions**:
- C-series robots physically relocated charging stations according to memes generated by M-series robots
- Settlement adopted a scheduling meme that solved the problem of crowded charging stations
- Robots were notified of specific times and charging station locations to optimize overall use of limited charging stations while staying on track for mission schedules.


#### Robots collaborate through shared memes for optimized battery charging and extraction.

**Mission-Related Meme Development:**
* Final representation of optimized battery charging determination: Fig. 5.6
* E2, E105, R5 navigate unexplored area for water resources
* Global map indicates no traversability or trafficability issues

**E2 Gets Stuck**:
- Early version of exploratory robot with smaller wheels
- Hole covered by loose soil not detected by sensors
- Unable to traverse rough terrain
- Proven memes and new updates used for extraction
* E105 and R5 respond:
- E105 arrives, takes images, passes them to E2 for analysis
- Both robots determine attempting different approaches may fail

**Extraction Attempts**:
- E105 uses meme for extracting other robots stuck in loose soil or rocks
- Attempt fails due to E2 being an older, heavier exploratory robot
- E105 sends information to manager robot M3 for assistance

**Manager Robot's Input**:
- Determines combination of E2 and a construction robot needed to produce enough force for extraction.


#### Robots collaborate to extract stuck exploratory robot using human guidance. Radiation effects on astronauts lead to increased human-robot interaction.

**Robot Assistance for Stuck Robot**
- **Construction robots**: Involved in constructing habitats for humans, behind schedule
- **Nearest construction robot**: Unable to assist due to schedule constraints, further delay would risk human arrival
- **Next nearest construction robot**: Several hours away, needs recharging before making the trip
- **Request for help sent to Earth-based team**
  - Included: picture of stuck robot, problem summary, diagnostics, current solution attempts
- **Human engineers' suggestions**: Attach R5 to E2 for greater pulling force, best angles for robots relative to each other
- **Manager robot (M3) analysis**: Joint force requirements for extraction, cooperative extraction methods
  - New memes emerged: older exploratory robots cannot get out of large holes, path through area is not safe, newer robots and research robots can pull older ones out.

**Human-Robot Symbiosis**
- **Astronaut Conrad**: Radiation exposure causes cognitive confusion, impaired vision, reduced curiosity
- **Interaction with M3 robot**: Increase in robot observances of human behavior and work practices
- **M3 benefited from high meme activity due to hours spent with Conrad.


#### Human-robot symbiosis: Learning and adapting in a Mars settlement

**Mars Settlement Scenario for M-series Robots**

**M3's Development**:
- Acquired effective memes, increasing its knowledge and capability as an M-series robot
- Adopted or learned "infected memes" due to chronic radiation condition in astronaut Conrad
- Determined performance had degraded and behavior was uncharacteristically ineffective
- Self-observed that infected memes had spread to other robots
- Acquired memes from healthy humans to facilitate self-repair
- Became cognitively astute, allowing other robots to assess the utility and effect of M3's new memes

**Healing of Other Robots**:
- High meme activity occurred as M3 shared its effective memes via the meme pool
- Other robots observed M3 and learned from it
- This "healing" process resulted in the recovery of other affected robots in the community

**Important Memetic Algorithm Development**:
- M-series robots developed algorithms to detect chronic radiation in humans by observation of behavior
- Robots became the primary means for detecting chronic radiation while bio-instrumentation was less relied upon

**Evolved Scenario**:
- Two years since memetic robots landed on Mars and started developing a robot community and human habitat
- Humans joined the robots a year ago, working to evolve an ever-improving community
- Robots learned the needs of humans, their schedule, and adapted to remain energy-positive
- Humans learned the strengths and weaknesses of robots and adjusted their own schedule accordingly
- New memes were introduced to direct robots' research and allocate tasks between humans and robots
- Human-robot interactions became seamless, with a new human-robot culture emerging
