# René Girard Theology And Pop Culture Theology Religion Ryan G Duns T Derrick Witherington 2021

> In René Girard, Theology, and Popular Culture, fifteen contributors consider how Girard’s mimetic theory can be used to uncover and probe the theological depths of popular culture. Creative and critical engagement with Girard’s theory enables the contributors to offer fresh and exciting interpretations of movies (The Devil Wears Prada, Mean Girls, Star Wars), television (Hoarders, Cobra Kai), classical literature and graphic novels, and issues ranging from anorexia to social media. The result is a volume that establishes Girard as an innovative interpreter of culture and shows him as an invaluable guide for theologically reflecting on desire, violence, redemption, and forgiveness. Written in fresh and lively prose, the contributors demonstrate not only that Girard provides a powerful lens through which to view culture but also—and more provocatively—challenge readers to consider what popular culture reveals about them. Readers looking for an accessible introduction to mimetic theory and exploring its theological application will find this a welcome resource. - [René Girard Theology and Pop Culture Theology Religion_Ryan G_Duns T_Derrick Witherington_2021](https://www.amazon.com/Ren%C3%A9-Girard-Theology-Pop-Culture/dp/1978710089?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

### Introduction

**Introduction**
- Collection of essays using René Girard's mimetic theory to analyze popular culture for theological themes
- Each author examines an artifact (movie, TV show, novel, etc.) through this lens
- "Popular culture" refers to shared structures, artifacts, beliefs, practices, and actions in a society
- Authors hail from various historical and cultural backgrounds
- Explores how popular culture can serve as a locus for theological reflection
- Introduces key concepts: mimetic desire, external and internal mediation, scapegoat, mythology, Judeo-Christian breakthrough

**Girard Biographical Sketch**
- Born in Avignon on Christmas Day 1923
- Emigrated to America in 1947, earned doctorate at Indiana University
- Taught at various colleges and universities (Duke, Bryn Mawr, Johns Hopkins, SUNY Buffalo) before assuming the Andrew B. Hammond Professorship at Stanford University
- His intellectual achievements honored with election to Académie française in 2005
- Authored at least eighteen books, inspired research across fields (philosophy, economics, literary criticism, gender studies, theology, neuroscience)
- Work continues to be studied and discussed, particularly through Colloquium on Violence and Religion (COV&R), Imitatio, Raven Foundation, and international network of researchers.

**Mimetic Theory: Key Insights**
1. **Mimetic Desire**: Desire is imitative or mimetic; we desire objects because others do, leading to a triangular structure of desire ("I desire according to the desire of another")
2. **Scapegoat**: People often direct blame and aggression toward an external object or individual, creating a mechanism for resolving conflict within a group
3. **Religious Conversion**: Judeo-Christian Scriptures provide a framework for understanding and overcoming mimetic desires and conflicts through spiritual transformation.
4. **Apocalypticism**: Girard's later work emphasizes the need for an "apocalyptic" shift in perspective to address the dangers of mimetic rivalries and scapegoating.

**The Devil Wears Prada: A Case Study in Mimetic Desire**
- Film about Andy, an aspiring journalist who becomes a second-assistant to Miranda Priestley at Runway magazine
- Transformation from frumpy outsider to fashionable insider strains her relationship with boyfriend Nate
- Girard's mimetic theory explains Andy's internal change and external appearance transformation
- Desire is mediated through models, as seen in the "cerulean sweater" scene: Miranda endows objects with desirability, leading Andy to adopt new lifestyle.


#### Exploring the origins of desires: Mimetic theory, fashion industry, intersubjectivity, being, and mediation.

**Mimetic Desire and Fashion Industry:**

**The Illusion of Autonomous Desire**
- Andy believes she's aloof from fashion industry's influence
- This is the "romantic lie" that gives a false sense of independence (Girard)
- Miranda dispels this illusion by revealing interconnectedness of desires

**Borrowed Desires: Novelistic Truth**
- We borrow desires from others, forming intersubjective "interdividuals"
- Authentic autonomy comes not by rejecting others' influence but recognizing it

**Innovation and Mimetic Theory**
- Critics argue Girard's theory leaves no room for innovation
- Novelty occurs when agents bring together and creatively combine desires mediated through relational nexuses

**Desire for Being vs. Desire to Have**
- "All desire is a desire for being" (Girard)
- External mediation: model conveys mode of being through speech, dress or lifestyle
- Internal mediation: subject and model fall into conflict over object, intensifying desire in reciprocal cycle

**The Belt Scene**
- Genealogy concerns external mediation: creative designers endow fashions with desirability
- Subtle beginning of internal mediation: Andy seeks Nigel's counsel and transforms, possessing confidence and style
- Increasingly oriented by Miranda, she desires according to haute couture other.


#### Desire and scapegoating in interpersonal conflicts: The Devil Wears Prada as a mimetic analysis.

**Mimetic Theory: The Devil Wears Prada**

**Genealogical Dimension of Mimetic Theory:**
- Desire not conjured out of thin air, but borrowed from the social other
- Interdividual subject: desires influenced by those around us

**Ontological Dimension of Mimetic Theory:**
- All desire is a desire for being
- Internal mediation can lead to rivalries and scapegoating

**Scene Analysis: "Everybody Wants to Be Us"**
- Two similar subjects converge on one desired object (editor)
- Miranda as model struggles to retain control, Jacqueline emerges as a rival
- Rivalry leads to crisis and need for release through scapegoating

**Scapegoating in The Devil Wears Prada:**
- Nigel's career sacrificed to prevent professional crisis and personal catastrophe for Runway magazine
- Sacrifice allows Jacqueline to take over Miranda's position
- Prevention of unrestrained rivalry and restoration of order

**Comparison with Caiphas: The Scapegoat's Role in Society**
- Expulsion of one figure unites the many against a common enemy or victim
- Historical precedent for scapegoating in times of chaos and disorder
- Miranda deliberately manipulates the process, unlike its natural emergence.


#### Exploring desire, myths, and redemption through Mimetic Theory and the Judeo-Christian Scriptures.

**Miranda Priestley and the Revelatory Power of Scripture**

**The Transformation of Andy**
- Miranda dons sunglasses, attracting reporters
- Andy sits speechless, reflecting on her mentor's words
- Reckoning moment: Does she want to be like Miranda?
- Miranda as a "Luciferian character," casting light in two directions
  - Enacts a "priestly" or hieratic role in sacrificing everything for Runway and position
  - Exposes the dynamics of mimetic desire

**The Redemption of Desire**
- **Mimetic Theory's Third Plank**: Revelatory power of Judeo-Christian Scriptures
- **Definition of Theology**: Intellectual effort to reflect on and present truths revealed by God
- Christian theologians agree that Scripture is central
- Girard appreciated the revelatory power of Scripture

**Myths vs. Scripture**
- Myths conceal real violence, narratively preserving the violent foundations of human culture
- Biblical stories take the side of the victim, exposing mythic darkness
- Christianity destroys mythology by revealing the mechanism of sacred violence

**The Triumph of the Cross**
- **Cross as a "divine trap"**: Exposes the old order and offers a new way of life
- The Cross pierces the mythic mantle, revealing humanity's dependence on violent scapegoating tendencies
- Girard's mimetic anthropology roots in Christian orthodoxy, leading to an account of being human that depends on the Cross.


#### Exploring human desire through religious symbols and Girard's anthropology in The Devil Wears Prada.

**The Cross and Humanity's Violent History (Good Friday vs. Easter)**
* The Cross reveals humanity's enthrallment by violent gods and pursuit of peace through violence
* On Good Friday, the Cross exposes our sinful history and desire's distortions
* At Easter, the Cross signifies redemption and new significance in being fully human in a broken world
* The Resurrection ratifies Jesus Christ's identity as a "Yes" to humanity's mendacity and violence

**The Devil Wears Prada: A Study of Desire and Redemption**
* Miranda Priestly represents desire's potential for redemption in the film
* Andy's casting of her phone into the fountain symbolizes a baptism, freeing her from deviated patterns of desire
* The ending suggests an apocalypse or revelation of human violence and culture's foundation on scapegoating

**Girard's Later Writings: Revelation and Human Culture's Choice**
* Girard introduces Battling to the End as an "apocalyptic book" revealing violent foundations of culture
* Humanity must acknowledge Christ's call to repent from violent ways or face mutually assured destruction
* Revelation is both informative (understanding dark origins) and formative, transforming how we live according to the Gospel.


#### Exploring René Girard's impact on interpreting popular culture and theology through essays on movies, TV shows, literature, and contemporary issues.

**Girard's Perspective on Culture and Popular Media:**
- René Girard's theories shed light on popular culture, providing insights into desire, relationships, and human behavior
- Misdirected desire can result in negative consequences (ontological sickness) but can also lead to freedom through understanding mimetic dynamics
- This volume explores various forms of media through a Girardian lens: films, television shows, literature, and social issues

**The Role of Mimetic Theory in Analyzing Culture:**
- Mimetic theory reveals hidden patterns within culture (desire, triangular relationships, scapegoating)
- Offers unique perspectives on popular media, helping readers appreciate the depths of stories and understand human dynamics
- Encourages critical thinking and ethical reflection on both the content and industry behind these works

**Overview of Essays:**
1. **Mean Girls, Fight Club, Wonder Woman, Star Wars**: Brian Bajzek et al. apply Girardian theory to examine desire, relationships, and societal issues in popular films.
2. **Television Analysis**: Paolo Diego Bubbio et al. explore how television shows reveal human dynamics through a Girardian lens and scrutinize ethical implications of contemporary programming.
3. **Literary Analysis with Girard**: Matthew Brake et al. delve into classic texts and graphic novels, highlighting the transformative power of mimetic theory in understanding complex stories.
4. **Social Issues through a Mimetic Lens**: Justin Dean Lee et al. examine social media, anorexia, and ecclesiastical reform, demonstrating how Girard's theories can be applied to various contemporary issues.


### 01. Mimesis Mean Girls and the Culture Creating Them

**Mean Girls: A Film Analysis through Mimetic Theory**

**Background:**
- Tina Fey's film "Mean Girls" critiques teenage life and social hierarchies
- High school presented as popularity contest
- Focus on female friendships, rivalry, and scapegoating
- Implicit questions: why is high school seen as a popularity contest? Why does popular culture perpetuate conflict between teenagers, especially girls?

**Plot Synopsis:**
1. **Cady Heron**: new to public high school after living in Africa for 12 years
2. Becomes friends with Janis and Damian, warned about the Plastics (Regina, Karen, Gretchen)
3. Infiltrates the Plastics despite warnings from Janis
4. Discovers Regina's "Burn Book" containing insults about classmates
5. Cady refuses to reveal the book's contents, but Janis plans revenge against Regina
6. Regina sabotages Cady's relationships and reputation in return
7. Girls engage in fistfights and chaos after school distribution of Burn Book
8. Cady takes responsibility for her actions, apologizes to Regina and Ms. Norbury
9. Cady competes in Mathlete finals and wins with a perfect answer

**Analyzing Mean Girls through Mimetic Theory:**
- Examining how we identify and view "mean girls" onscreen
- Discussing potential implications for women offscreen
- Questions: why is high school seen as a popularity contest? Why does popular culture create conflict between teenagers, especially girls? Are viewers complicit in teaching girls to be "mean"?


#### Mean Girls: Analyzing Human Desire through Mimesis and Internal Mediation in Adolescent Social Hierarchies.

**Mean Girls: Mimesis and Mediation of Desire**

**Observation on Human Imitation:**
- Mean Girls explores layers of interteen inauthenticity through the lens of mimetic desire
- Girard's work highlights that human beings are innately imitative, desires mediated through those we seek to imitate
- This mediation is often unconscious and shapes our culture, leading to social hierarchies (external mediation)

**External Mediation in Mean Girls:**
- Regina George serves as a model of perfection, inspiring obsession and emulation among her peers
  - Introduced with fawning admiration from boys, Janis' assessment of her popularity
  - Her name meaning "the queen" emphasizes her status as a social influencer

**Internal Mediation in Mean Girls:**
- Cady's desire for Regina escalates into an internal rivalry over Aaron
  - Triangular relationship between Cady, Regina, and Aaron
  - Desire to supplant Regina drives Cady's actions

**Implications of Internal Mediation:**
- The imitator seeks to become the model of imitation, attempting to fill a void within themselves (radical ontological sickness)
- This desire can lead to all-consuming obsession and destructive behavior as the lines between object, imitation, and desire blur.

**Cady's Transformation:**
- Cady becomes Regina's double through her intense rivalry with her
- Aaron's disgust at Cady's transformation reflects the doubling effect of their mimetic relationship.


#### Mean Girls critique of high school culture, mimesis, and societal influence on identity formation.

**Adults' Impact on Teenagers**
- Adults' role in exacerbating high school issues: Mrs. George, Coach Carr, Regina's mother
- Notable exception: Ms. Norbury
- Criticism of American pop culture and its influence on teens

**Pop Culture Critique in Mean Girls**
- Ascendance of reality TV and celebrity fetishization
- Connection between pop culture mimesis and scapegoating behavior
  - Regina George as an extension of MTV's My Super Sweet 16
  - Paris Hilton and lifestyle celebrities

- Mean Girls deconstructs the teen comedy genre by presenting a vérité filmique that challenges the mimetic mechanism and its cycles of scapegoating
- The film's final shot inverts the opening scene, inviting viewers to reflect on their own perspectives and biases about teenagers.

#### Star Wars as a tragic reflection of mythical lies and mimetic dynamics in society. Anakin Skywalker's story illustrates the role of desire, violence, and scapegoating in the Force and the rise of the Galactic Empire.

**Star Wars as a Tragedy: Anakin Skywalker's Story**

**Introduction**:
- Tragedy distorts reality by placing blame on victims instead of acknowledging shared violence and differences between community and victims
- Star Wars reflects this dynamic through the story of Anakin Skywalker

**Anakin Skywalker as a Tragic Figure**:
- Originated partly from the Force itself due to great control over it and lack of a biological father
- Traumatized by loss of mother, secretly marries pregnant wife Padmé Amidala (mother figure)
- Transgresses Jedi prohibition on attachments, becomes a transgressor like Oedipus

**The Dark Side of the Force**:
- Responsible for violent disorder and breeds rivalry
- The light side eliminates threats to maintain peaceful order

**The Role of Darth Plagueis**:
- Model-obstacle: commands Anakin to imitate his desire while being an obstacle to it
- Triggers mimetic dynamic between Anakin and Palpatine (Sith Lord)

**Mimetic Rivalry in Star Wars**:
- The more the antagonists desire to become different, the more they become identical
- Identity is realized in hatred of the identical, embodied by rivalry between doubles
- Palpatine sows crisis and offers himself as a solution (Satan figure)

**Anakin's Tragic Fate**:
- Loses Padmé due to rage against Jedi
- Ends up entombed in black armor, dismembered trying to slay Obi-Wan
- Price of salvation: steep cost for gaining power over the Empire (Pyrrhic victory)

**Mimetic Rivalry Revealed**:
- Majority rule enables victors to depict enemy's violence as monstrous and their own as noble
- Star Wars reveals that rulers and enemies are two sides of the same mimetic rivalry coin.


#### Star Wars as a reflection of the mythical lie about violence and redemption through the Jedi and Sith's rivalry.

**Star Wars and Power:**
- Power results from comparison with perceived competitors (sometimes imagined)
- Without threat of loss, sense of power doesn't exist
- Power is an endless reaffirmation of victory over rivalry

**The Sith and Jedi Rivalry:**
- Both the Sith and Jedi seek greater power
- Fear of losing power is a weakness for both
- Palpatine, as temptation to disintegrating rivalry, resembles Satan

**New Crisis and Solution:**
- Padmé's children lead separate lives
- Luke Skywalker sets out to become a Jedi, trains with Obi-Wan and Yoda
- Learns his father is Darth Vader
- Final confrontation between father and son: no killing
- Vader vanquishes Emperor, reconciled before dying

**Mythical Consciousness:**
- Myths obscure mimetic origin of crisis and unity
- Victim blamed for both crisis and order restoration
- Transfiguration of victim from negative to positive

**Star Wars and the Gospel:**
- Star Wars reflects mythical lie about violence
- No inevitable forces cause cyclical violence
- Gospel reveals truth, destroying justifications for violence
- Jesus' teaching: love God, neighbor as yourself (Mark 12:28–31)
- Prohibition on idolatry and deifying anything including identity.


#### Exploring Jesus' message of love and non-violence contrasted with Star Wars' themes of power and rivalry.

**Jesus' Challenge to Community Dynamics**

**Mythical Identity and Love**:
- Basic identity derived from community myths
- Jesus' teachings challenge deification of community and attitude towards external enemies
- Provides internal uniformity through gossip and exclusion of "other"

**Sameness Between Group and External Enemy**:
- Jesus challenges the violent peace of any sacrificial order
- Transforms mimesis from power competition to withdrawal from rivalry (grace)
- Criticizing clique's depiction of excluded "slut" leads to internal debates and inclusion of "other"

**Caiaphas and Sacrificed Peace**:
- Caiaphas presents solution of sacrifice to save community from civil war
- Attempts to draw Jesus into violent competition for power
- Jesus refuses to answer violence with violence, exposing the true cause of desire to eliminate him

**Conclusion**:
- Crucified Jesus seems to have lost, but his death differs from Vader's
- Reveals universal lie of scapegoat mechanism behind redemptive violence
- Easter Sunday reveals crucified Jesus as living incarnation of non-violent Love and true Messiah
- Eucharistic commemoration invites sharing forgiving withdrawal from violence.


### 03. Desire the Scapegoated Other and J.J. Abrams The Force Awakens

**Desire, the Scapegoated Other, and J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens**

**Overview:**
- Focus on edifying reading of J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens using René Girard's analysis
- Movie reflects dominant social values and sustains violent order (post-9/11 cinema)
- Two steps: contextualizing "myth" in Star Wars through Girard, then reading key features of Abrams' film.

**Myth and Girard's Demythologizing:**
- Andrew Gordon's connection between Star Wars and myth
- Controversial to label Star Wars as a new myth due to cultural contexts and values
- Myths reflect societies' prevailing values, often masking necessary violence
- Importance of understanding the function of myths in society

**Girard's Theory:**
- Focus on persecution texts and myths that mask necessary violence
- Violence perpetuates the system, reinforces it (sacrificial system or victim mechanism)
- Cultural commentators demystify violence to enable insight into myths.

**Star Wars: The Force Awakens:**
- Launches viewer into conflict without focusing on origins of violence (First Order's attack on Tuanul)
- Differences from Lucas's prequel trilogy in approach to understanding violence.


#### Analysis of Star Wars: The Force Awakens through René Girard's Mimetic Theory and social violence.

**The Escalation of Violence in Star Wars: The Force Awakens**

**Mimetic Desire and Violence**:
- Violent contagion has escalated beyond the ability for political diplomacy or compromise
- Result of a belligerent antagonism that comes too late for political solutions
- Reflects the love of director George Lucas for Flash Gordon adventure serials
- Mimetic desire is learned through imitation, leading to escalating violence without the control provided by sacrificial rituals
- Violence is self-propagating as everyone wants to strike the last blow

**The First Order's Resentment and Vengefulness**:
- The First Order displays signs of resentment and vengefulness against the New Republic
- General Hux's impassioned oratory in The Last Jedi is full of spite and unrestrained animosity toward the New Republic
- No compromise or peaceful accord is possible, only the rising of the First Order to enact vengeance
- Resembles the rise of National Socialism out of resentment at the deal forced upon Germany

**Mimetic Rivalry and the Scapegoat**:
- Kylo Ren's violent eruptions in response to failure and loss of control
- Hux makes the New Republic into the scapegoat for the ills of the imperial military order and the galaxy
- The First Order seeks to restore galactic rule through a militarized state, displacing violence onto the governing order

**Social Containment of Violence**:
- Collective violence is used to drive out violence, but it must be specific and not set off further cycles of vengeance
- The ritual cure founded on an act of destruction, with social peace under the militarized First Order state governance


#### Analysis of "The Force Awakens" and scapegoating: us-them dichotomy and justification of violence against perceived enemies.

**Scapegoating and The Force Awakens:**
- Individuals with certain qualities are prone to being scapegoated during times of scarcity, fear, crisis, and disaster (Girard)
- Scapegoats seen as "omnipotent manipulators" and "monstrous" others (Girard)
- Minorities, strangers/foreigners, social outsiders often targeted for socially sacrificial violence
- Desire to simplify existence by scapegoating others as "aliens" (Kearney)

**The First Order:**
- Weapon of Mass Destruction used in catastrophic preemptive strike against New Republic centers
- Modeled after Death Stars but with greater destructive capabilities
- Originates from outside the Republic, erupting as an "alien" peril (contrast to prequels)
- Tightly defined inclusion/exclusion boundaries between good and evil (Abrams' movie)

**Good vs. Evil:**
- The Force seen as having a duality of light and dark sides
- Both sides blame each other, no rational deciding between them
- Resistance is portrayed as "brave" in contrast to sinister First Order
- Perpetrators believe their actions against scapegoats are justified (victim responsibility)

**Mythology of Scapegoating:**
- Myth articulates absolute faith in victim's power of evil or good
- Allows for deflection of blame away from "us" to "them"
- Good is natural, identified with "us," while evil has no history or explanation (Supreme Leader Snoke)

**Potential Destabilization:**
- Kylo Ren's desire to be renewed in the power of light and darkness could challenge good-evil binary.


#### Analyzing Star Wars: The Force Awakens and its representation of violence in the context of post-9/11 cinema and scapegoating mechanism.

**The Force Awakens: Post-9/11 Cinema and Violence (McSweeney's Perspective)**

**Background:**
- The Force Awakens' depiction of violence in the context of post-9/11 cinema
- Double politics of purity and blame, innocent victim vs. intelligible evil perpetrator
- Uncritical representation of American victimization
- Detachment from complexities of geographical arena and historical context

**Myth as Dehumanization**:
- Myth illegitimately suggests it's experienced as innocent speech
- Naturalizes itself as factual, depoliticized speech
- Conceals social origins of mimetic rivalry and violence against the scapegoat

**Lucas's Original Trilogy**:
- Critique of politics, imperialism, and societal issues
- Rebellion against political disorder
- Encoding references to ancient Roman and modern British imperialism

**Abrams' Contribution (The Force Awakens)**:
- Post 9/11 cinema influence
- Demonization and exclusion of the enemy as pure "other"
- Reduction of First Order motivations to destructive resentment and revenge
- Less obvious redemption consists in annihilation of threat
- Inhospitable vision of healing through necessary violence or holy war
- Apocalyptic conflict to the bitter end.

**Notes:**
1. Films as "texts" requiring interpretation as speech (Derrida, "Hospitality, Justice and Responsibility")
2. Attention given to The Force Awakens in its own right and comparison with Lucas's six episodes
3. Invitation for further analysis of political sensibility between Lucas and his successors without conflation of the series.

**Introduction:**
- New installment of superhero Diana Prince (Wonder Woman) from DC Comics in 2017 film
- Defeats villain Ares, god of war, using human daring and superhuman powers
- Relationship between Wonder Woman and Ares analyzed through René Girard's perspective

**The Satanic Figure of Ares:**
- Can be interpreted as a Satanic figure following Girard's understanding of Satan
- Signifiers for this mechanism: satan, devil, prince of this world, father of lies
- In the film, Ares is a rejected son and rival god to his father Zeus
- Envious antagonist to humans, stirring jealousy and accusation, hoping to lure into total war

**The Satanic Process or Mechanism:**
- Symbolized by character Ares in Wonder Woman narrative
- Ignites strife between humans and keeps total apocalypse at bay
- Enacts mimetic rivalry with father Zeus and human creatures
- Operates as "prince of this world," causing disorder while maintaining order

**Girard's Interpretation of Satan:**
- No stable foundation, no autonomous ontology
- Derivative power derived from scapegoat mechanism (satanic process)
- Envious rival to God and His creatures
- Symbolized by figure of Satan (the accuser), devil, father of lies, prince of this world

**The Impact of Ares:**
- War ravaged the earth, enslavement of peoples including Amazons
- Zeus forced Ares to retreat using last of his divine power
- Ares will regain strength and return at an opportune time to finish mission

**Conclusion:**
- Viewer alerted that defeating Ares may require different means than divine intervention.


#### War and divine identity: Jesus vs Zeus, Diana's journey to defeat human conflict.

**Themyscira and the Amazons:**
- **Jesus and Zeus**: after overcoming their foes, Jesus gathers a group of people to proclaim God's Kingdom while Zeus hides a "god-killer" weapon on Themyscira.
- **Diana's Upbringing**: Diana, the only child on Themyscira, longs to learn the arts of battle but is prohibited by her mother Queen Hippolyta.
- **Ares and the War**: As Ares' powers return, the Amazons prepare for war to defend against him. Captain Steve Trevor reveals the upcoming decisive battle in World War I.

**Diana's Departure**:
- Diana sets sail for London with Captain Trevor to stop Ares/General Ludendorff and Dr. Moreau.
- In London, Sir Patrick Morgan advises against stopping the war due to the pursuit of peace through negotiation.
- Sir Patrick's actions resemble the "Satanic wager" mentioned by Rene Girard, where sacrificing victims is deemed necessary for peace.

**The Final Battle**:
- Diana confronts General Ludendorff (believed to be Ares) and kills him with the "god-killer" sword.
- Realizing that stopping one "bad guy" does not end the war, Diana questions human goodness and contemplates abandoning her mission.
- Captain Trevor teaches Diana that it's not about deserve or blame but what we believe; we are all responsible for peace.


#### Exploring the complex nature of desire and evil through the mythological character Ares in "Wonder Woman"

**The Passion and Ares' Reveal**

**Human Participants**:
- Become violent when a mimetic snowballing comes within their range
- Are incapable of resisting this violent contagion

**Captain Trevor and Sir Patrick Morgan**:
- Captain Trevor departs, leaving Diana behind
- Diana questions the truth as Sir Patrick remains in the control tower
- Realizes that Ares can appear in many guises and has been fooled

**Sir Patrick as Ares**:
- Subverts the viewer's stereotype of who the "bad guys" and "good guys" are
- Advocates for an armistice while secretly advising Trevor to defeat Ludendorff
- Sows disorder and confusion, playing the role of the "prince of this world"

**Diana's Realization**:
- Ares is not her enemy as she thought, but rather the one who seeks to lure her further into his game
- Reveals that Diana is the god-killer, not her sword

**Ares' Seduction of Diana**:

- Importance of choosing to imitate Christ over Satan.


### 05. Those Who Have Eyes to See

**Those Who Have Eyes to See: The Divine Origins of the Modern Plot Twist**

**The Destruction of the Scapegoat Mechanism**:
- Required a group of dissenters who were willing to report what they had truly seen
- The reality of this group is important, as they are the first visible body in history to proclaim the innocence of the victim
- This group is indispensable for the unconcealment of scapegoating

**The Revelation of the Scapegoat Mechanism**:
- Occurred most fully during the Paschal Mystery - the Passion, Burial, and Resurrection of Jesus
- The Crucifixion is what highlighted the victimary mechanism and explained history
- It represents a permanent shift in our understanding of the world's story

**The Distinction Between Mythology and Revelation**:
- A story that seemed to be unfolding before a plot twist represents mythology
- A post-plot twist narrative, guided by the white light of some truth disclosure, represents revelation

**The Necessity of a Community in the Act of Revelation**:
- The community of unbelievers in scapegoating, the Church, was and is absolutely necessary for the revelation to be manifest
- This community is likened to a movie audience who experiences a plot twist
- The revelation at the Cross, embodied by the centurion's words, is not unlike a moviegoer who has apprehended a plot twist

**The Symbolism of the Crucified Christ**:
- The Church held the "forever living having been slain" Christ as its preeminent symbol
- This inversion of mythology depended upon a community who would champion the innocence of the victim, Christ


#### Plot twists reveal hidden truths and challenge perceived narratives.

**Reality and Plot Twists**

**The Cross as a Plot Twist**:
- The Cross pierces the mythic layer of culture and releases the Good News
- Similar to how a thematic plot twist pierces the mythic layer of a perceived narrative and reveals the true one
- Recognizing the narrative shift is to be part of an audience, an "audience with eyes to see"

**Recognizing Plot Twists**:
- Some more intuitive members of the audience may anticipate a plot twist before it occurs
- However, modern plot twists are typically well-concealed by skilled storytellers
- Audience members must make the transition from false belief to true apprehension

**Fight Club as an Example**:
- The film contains numerous clues indicating that the two main characters are one and the same person
- However, these clues are often overlooked by audiences when watching the film for the first time
- Like Simeon or the Magi in the Gospels, some audience members may trust the clues and anticipate the plot twist

**The Village as an Example**:
- The film features a formidable plot twist that exclusively enlightens the audience, rather than the characters
- This is demonstrated when Ivy, who is blind, reaches the edge of the forbidden woods and discovers an ivy-covered fence
- When the scene cuts to Ivy's father opening a black box containing a photograph from the 1970s, the audience realizes that the villagers are not living in the 19th century as they appear


#### Mimetic Theory: Plot Twists and Revelations in Film and History

**Mythology and Revelation in The Village and The Others**

**The Myth of The Village:**
- Leaders perpetuate a myth through deception
- Audience learns the truth, but main characters remain unaware
- Revealed truth does not change expectations (anagnorisis)
- Kairotic moments reveal nonchronological center of an unfolding event
- Revelation in The Others: Grace realizes she and her family are ghosts
- Whole plot is recontextualized by kairotic moment
- New narrative emerges, compelling audience to rewatch the film

**The Crucifixion as a Plot Twist:**
- Kairotic center located at Death, Burial, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ
- Revealed truth breaks with deceptions (divine plot twist)
- Small minority of witnesses apprehended it
- Foundational significance for early Christians
- Test for true membership: faithfulness to the revelation
- New religion based on an entirely new narrative.

**Mythology vs. Reality:**
- Most people remained in myth's grip during Jesus' crucifixion
- Few dissenters recognized the divine plot twist
- World continued as usual, seemingly unchanged by event
- Those with eyes to see saw something new and significant.


#### Exploring the connection between film plot twists and the impact of Christ's revelation on human understanding according to René Girard.

**Impact of Revelation on Mythology**
- Jesus' death and resurrection: radical and fundamental truth for human beings (Girard)
- Preceded by a dissenting minority who reported its significance
- Not dependent on individual perception, but collective understanding

**Plot Twists in Film and Literature**
- Origins in Christological event
- Reveal deeper meaning or hidden truths
- Bring audiences out of mythology and into reality
- Enable comprehension of Girard's insights

**Understanding the Cross through Plot Twists**
- Linking film plot twists to divine revelation at the Cross
- Transformation from old world to new one
- Essential transformation in Christian theology (Hardin)

**Mythology vs. Post-Christ Event**
- Two worlds: mythology and post-Christ
- Plot twists enable understanding of the divine plot twist
- Brings audiences out of mythology and into reality

**The Significance of Jesus' Death**
- Innocent victim puts to death, remembered by some for its significance
- Dissenting minority reported the truth about Jesus
- Collective understanding essential for historical significance

**Moviegoers' Experience of Plot Twists**
- Discussing and affirming shared experience
- Affirmation that each has seen what others have

**Conclusion**
- Application of film to Girard's theory opens new vistas for understanding the world and his key insights.


### 06. Gazing into a Mirror

**Hoarding Disorder and Mimetic Theory**

**Background:**
- Hoarders TV show provides insight into Hoarding Disorder
- First aired in 2009, clinical research expanded since then
- Ancient references to hoarding in mythology, literature, and history
- DSM-5 recognition: acquisition of useless or limited value items
- Living spaces cluttered, preventing intended use
- Significant distress or impairment caused by hoarding

**Mimetic Theory:**
- All desire is imitative (Girard)
- Desire is triangular: subject desires object due to model's desire
- Hoarding can be seen through mimetic theory lens

**Hoarding Disorder and Mimetic Theory Connection:**
- Immoderate drive to acquire objects
- Inordinate attachment to possessions
- Anosognosia (lack of awareness) prevents parting with items
- Double bind: "Do Not Hoard" and "Hoard"
- Desire is learned through imitation, hoarding as a pattern of desire

**Mimetic Theory's Impact on Viewing Hoarders:**
- Reveals viewers' own distorted patterns of desire
- Diagnoses viewers' ontological sickness (unhealthy longings)
- Critique: exploitation of mental illness for entertainment purposes
- Theological significance: purification, illumination, and unification processes.


#### Exploring Desire's Dark Side: Hoarders through a Mimetic Lens

**Hoarding Disorder: An Examination through Mimetic Desire Theory**

**Overview:**
- Hoarders episode analysis using Girard's perspective on desire and its triangularity (model, self, object).
- Ontological sickness: undirected desire leading to hoarding disorder.

**Ontological Sickness:**
- Derived from metaphysical desire
- Negative connotation in early works of Girard
- Later recognized as good but susceptible to negative influence

**Hoarding Disorder:**
- Unsatisfiable longing and acquisition
- Desire for being instead of objects
- Absence of viable model leading to disoriented desire

**Impact of Trauma:**
- Loss of model permits hoarding disorder onset
- Desire expands uncontrollably, grasping at everything
- Value blindness: regarding all things as desirable in the absence of a model

**Implications:**
- Absence of direction for desire leads to hoarding
- Hedonic adaptation prevents permanent satisfaction
- Tragic outcome despite endless acquisition.

**Mimetic Desire Theory:**
- People influence one another and desire same things
- Desire directed by a model, endowing objects with value
- Absence of model allows for undirected desire and hoarding disorder.


#### Analyzing Hoarders through Mimetic Theory: Desire, Scapegoating, and Empathy.

**Girard's Mimetic Theory and Hoarding**

**Observation on Hoarders TV Show**:
- Criticism of dehumanizing nicknames used by the show
- Discussion of two episodes: Terry (Season 6, Episode 8) and Shanna (Season 6, Episode 4)

**Terry's Story**:
- Middle-aged woman who hoards animals
- Nearly 50 pets living in her home covered in feces and ammonia
- Over 100 dead cats stored in refrigerator, resulting in cat-soup
- Explains connection to father's death and caregiving desire

**Shanna's Story**:
- Lives with mother until her death
- Stored nearly nine tons of human waste in the house
- Perplexed by stench, continues eating contaminated food
- Described as "The Poop Lady" by producers

**Ethical Concerns**:
- Exploitation and sensationalization of subjects' struggles
- Reduction of mental illness to catchy slogans and nicknames
- Scapegoating cycle turning viewers against the subject

**Girard's Perspective**:
- Recognizing the pattern of desire in hoarding disorder
- Understanding how self-destructive patterns manifest in different ways
- Emphasizing the similarities rather than differences between viewer and subject
- Questioning the real monster: the viewer or the person depicted on the show?


#### Exploring Hoarders: Purgative Journey to Healing and Desire in Christian Mysticism

**Impact of Hoarders on Empathy and Exploitation**

**Empathy Stirring**:
- Producers' rites lead to public humiliation of vulnerable women and men
- Viewer's gaze pierces the show's mythic veil, revealing the person beneath the illness
- This can lead viewers to stand in solidarity with those depicted and struggle to restore humanity

**Theologically Relevant Element**:
- Hoarders depicts a pathway for spiritual growth similar to Christian mysticism's purgative, illuminative, and unitive "ways"
- Purgative way: purifies the soul and loosens sinful attachments
- Illuminative way: enlightens and directs one toward God
- Unitive stage: enters into communion with God
- Elements of each way are present in the other

**Hoarders as a Journey**:
- Mystics begin their journeys at the prompting of another, just like those treated for hoarding
- Interventions seek to cure "hoard-blindness"
- Divine grace transforms the way one relates to the Holy One, healing and reorienting desire

**Glen's Case**:
- Glen, dubbed "The Rat Man", had a hoard of 2,500 rodents
- He was initially hoard-blind but began to perceive the scope of the problem with help from Dr. Zasio
- Naming his grief and processing it allowed him to accept help and successfully remain hoard-free

**Criticism**:
- Hoarders depicts extreme behavior only as a means of finding colorful analogues for psychological processes in "normal" people
- Viewers are implicated in the inhuman exploitation of the mentally ill by peering voyeuristically into their suffering


#### Reflection on Hoarders: Desire, Spirituality, and Healing from Consumerism and Hoarding.

**Hoarders: A Spiritual Perspective**

**Background:**
- Television show "Hoarders" can serve as a mediator of gracious light
- Encourages reflection on the nature of desire and hoarding patterns

**Impact of Hoarders:**
- Provokes viewers to scrutinize their own desire and hoarding tendencies
- Reveals socially-sanctioned hoarding of wealth, power, prestige, and possessions
- Leads one to discover that no finite thing can satisfy the hunger of desire

**Mimetic Theory:**
- Provides a lens for understanding the dynamics present within Hoarders
- Highlights the victim-making mechanism in the entertainment industry
- Challenges viewers to consider their interdividuality and how desires have been shaped by others

**Spiritual Pilgrimage:**
- Freed from hoarding tendencies, one can begin a spiritual journey toward communion with the One
- Recognizing the presence of the Innocent Victim, we are called to respond in solidarity and make a difference

**Anselm's Prayer:**
- Depicts desire's longing for the infinite, separated from God
- Acknowledges that no finite thing can satisfy our deepest desires
- Sees this breakdown as desire's great triumph, leading one to discover intimations of fullness that cannot be hoarded or controlled.


### 07. From the Hermeneutic of Violence to Redemption

**From the Hermeneutic of Violence to Redemption: The 100 and Mimetic Theory**

**The 100 Series Background**:
- Nuclear holocaust wiped out almost all life on Earth, leaving only 2,400 people on a space station named "The Ark"
- 100 juvenile prisoners sent to Earth to determine if humans can live there again
- Existence of "Grounders", descendants of survivors who regressed to a barbaric stage and live in clans locked in a power struggle

**The Grounders' Society**:
- Based on warrior ethic, with the principle "Blood must have blood"
- Victims of violence held responsible and killed to restore peace
- Mythical figure "Bekka Pramheda" (Becca Franco) became a divine figure after creating a nuclear apocalypse to atone for her creation

**The Mountain Men**:
- Descendants of survivors who locked themselves in a bunker before the apocalypse
- Decide to use Sky People as forced donors for bone marrow transplants, even if it means killing them
- Trapped in the sacrificial way of thinking

**Clarke's Journey**:
- Sees no other option but to irradiate the bunker, killing the entire Mountain Men population
- Feels guilty and lives like a hermit, feared and revered among the Grounders as "Wanheda"
- Convicts Chancellor Pike for massacring the Grounders' army without provocation
- Encourages Lexa to give up on revenge and show the world a better way

**Violence as a Contagion: The Temptations of Sacrifical Peace**:
- A.L.I.E., an Artificial Intelligence, tries to lure people into the "City of Light" virtual simulation
- Joining the City of Light erases physical and emotional pain, but also human free will
- More and more people fall under A.L.I.E.'s mind-controlling influence, leading to violent rivalry as subjects' desires converge


#### Violence, redemption, and the human condition: Clarke's journey towards understanding mimetic crisis

**Theoretical Analysis: A.L.I.E. and Russell's Approaches to Peace**

**A.L.I.E.'s Solution:**
- Seeks peace for the sake of mankind
- Offers removal of desire, effectively negating human identity
- Represents a form of temptation: giving up free will to avoid suffering (see Clarke's destruction of A.L.I.E.)

**Russell's Solution:**
- Seeks peace for the sake of the Primes
- Offers false god worship and submission to violent ruling
- Represents another form of temptation: idolatry of false gods (see Clarke's journey of conversion)

**Octavia Blake's Experiences:**
- Faces hallucinations, including Pike who challenges her desire for forgiveness/redemption
- Splits into two personas: Octavia and Blodreina (her dark violent self)
- Realizes need for redemption through self-reflection on entanglement in mimeticism and propensity to violence

**Redemption:**
- State of being kept from evil or improving morally
- Liberation from sin brought about through atonement
- Repentance, changed orientation, ongoing conversion
- Recognition of own entanglement in mimeticism and propensity to violence (Girard's concept)

**Scapegoating:**
- A mechanism for restoring peace temporarily by blaming those who appear different or responsible for community unrest
- Represented by A.L.I.E.'s warning of impending Earth destruction due to nuclear reactors melting down and Octavia's violent ruling in Sanctum.


#### Girard's perspective on conversion: Christian redemption through divine grace and self-discovery.

**Girard's View on Conversion:**
- Criticized for Gnosticism and Pelagianism in understanding salvation
- Replies that comprehension of Gospels requires divine grace, not reason alone
- Affirmation of need for divine grace to access religious dimension
- Human beings cannot achieve redemption without special grace from Christ
- Conversion is a process of discovering one's sinfulness and being forgiven
- Non-explicitly Christian conversions follow the same pattern as Christian ones (novelistic)

**Octavia's Conversion:**
- Rejection of violent self, symbolic killing of dark side
- Initial temptation to sacrifice herself for people
- Realization that violence is not the solution and needs to change way of thinking
- Epiphany: there has to be a better way
- Acting according to newfound understanding (do better)

**Clarke's Conversion:**
- Confrontation with own consciousness (Josephine)
- Realization of past actions and their consequences
- Decision not to repeat past mistakes
- Infiltrating Sanctum as Josephine to save innocent lives
- New perspective on conversion: good works are necessary after receiving grace.

**Implications:**
- Conversion changes the way one deals with moral dilemmas
- Importance of divine grace in understanding salvation and redemption.


#### Moral dilemmas, violence, self-discovery, and nonviolent solutions in Girard's mimetic theory.

**Girard's Mimetic Theory and Moral Sense:**
* Our traditional "moral sense" shaped by attempts to understand difference between good and bad violence and actions promoting crisis or ending it
* Clarke's actions at Mount Weather consistent with sacrificial moral sense, as they effectively end the crisis
* Girard emphasizes need to give up right to retribution and self-defense in favor of nonviolence
* Self-suspicion essential for understanding desire and violence; developing dispositions to consider other perspectives, demystify justifications for violence, and think differently
* Cultivation of virtues informed by mimetic theory aids achievement of balancing desire and avoiding violent mimeticism
* Praktikos phronesis: good judgment inspired by truth of victim and self-trained to find nonviolent solutions to moral dilemmas.

**Girard's Interpretation of the Katechon:**
* The katechon, as mentioned in 2 Thessalonians 2:1–12, refers to the sacrificial violence that channels uncontrolled violence
* After Christian revelation, katechon retains some aspects of old order to prevent absolute violence
* Difficulty lies in determining least possible violence required to prevent violence.

**Clarke's Responsibility as a Leader:**
* Clarke bears responsibility for protecting her group at Mount Weather
* Girard raises question: How must those with authority act if they know? (regarding the katechon dilemma).

### 08. Mercy Honor and Girardian Conversion in The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai

**The Karate Kid and Mimetic Desire**

**Background:**
- The Karate Kid (1984) was a successful underdog story about Daniel LaRusso learning karate from Mr. Miyagi to gain self-respect, social status, and Ali's affection.
- The film spawned sequels, a Nintendo game, and the YouTube series Cobra Kai.
- Academic attention has been given to the movie's themes of martial arts and masculinity, as well as Daniel's and Miyagi's relationship.

**Mimetic Desire:**
- René Girard's concept of mimetic desire: one's desire is determined through a triangular relationship with a model.
- In The Karate Kid, Johnny Lawrence desires Ali Mills due to Daniel LaRusso being his model and believing Daniel has taken her away.
- Desire is internally mediated when the desiring subject and model are within each other's social sphere, leading to attempts to eliminate the rival.

**Impact on Characters:**
- Daniel also develops similar tutelary beliefs about Johnny and Ali, seeing them together as a rivalry.
- This leads to negative emotions and actions between the two characters throughout the film.
- The pure or noble love between Daniel and Ali is contaminated by mimetic rivalry whenever Johnny enters the picture.


#### Mimetic desire and hate in The Karate Kid: Girardian analysis and spiritual solutions.

**The Karate Kid: Reciprocal Hate and Mimetic Desire**

**Girardian Reading**:
- Reveals no good or bad guy in The Karate Kid
- Each boy believes they are the hero, the other is the villain
- Unknowingly implicated in the mimetic process
- Both morally culpable for reducing Ali to a mere object

**Reciprocity and Reciprocal Hate**:
- Central element of internal mediation that drives conflict
- Each boy's desire intensifies as they imitate each other
- Aggression fuels the "mediator-subject" and "subject-mediator" roles
- Mutual enmity unites them in obsession over each other's downfall

**Miyagi and the Teaching of Christ/Buddhism**:
- **Detached generosity**: being kind without favoritism or prejudice
- Christ as a model to prevent mimetic rivalries
- Buddhist concepts of **Right Thought** and **Right Action**:
  - Act without attachment to views or conditions
  - Abstain from taking life, stealing, lying, or causing suffering
- Parallels with Christian teachings on **Ignatian Indifference**

**Miyagi's Teaching Method**:
- Inviting Daniel to trim a bonsai tree: action should not be fettered by preconception
- Deceptively menial chores at his house: reinforce the importance of health, growth, and beauty


#### Karate as a transformative spiritual art: Overcoming selfish desires and promoting peace.

**Karate as a Transformative Practice**
* **Karate exercises in The Karate Kid:** Daniel performs tasks that strengthen muscles and teach defense but also have symbolic significance
* Miyagi's teachings have multiple layers, meant to pay close attention to
* Exercises are restorative and transformative for both the physical space and the characters
* Critique: some argue martial arts are inherently violent due to teaching fighting skills
	+ Modernized forms of karate less focused on philosophical education and more on competition
	+ Sport karate developed specifically for competitive fighting
* Miyagi's karate is different: victory over oneself is primary goal, focus on spirit not form
* Overcoming "selfish desire" as key to peace and nonviolent solutions to conflicts
* Miyagi sees opponents as friends rather than enemies to avoid polarization and minimize violence
* In The Karate Kid Part II, Miyagi seeks reconciliation with rival instead of conflict.

**Understanding Miyagi's Karate**
* Connection to spiritual art: aikido, founder Morihei Ueshiba teaches victory over self as primary goal
* Spiritual martial arts view things on higher level, based on love and non-seeking of enemies
* Material martial arts fixate on physical objects and are sources of contention due to opposition of two forces.

**Daniel's Attitude Towards Martial Arts**
* Distraught after being attacked by Kreese's student, wants to prove he can take a beating
* Preoccupied with what others think, may not fully understand Miyagi's teachings
* Desire for balance questionable if it doesn't match Miyagi's definition.


#### Cobra Kai: Rekindled Rivalry and Mimetic Cycle.

**Cobra Kai: Reigniting Rivalry and the Mimetic Cycle**

**Understanding Daniel's Perspective:**
- Feeling content is lacking due to rivalry with Johnny

#### Mimetic Theory's impact on understanding mercy and honor in The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai.

**The Concept of Mercy in The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai**

**Understanding of Mercy**:
- Johnny and Kreese's view is rooted in combat rather than love
- It is the decision not to strike the final blow, but can propagate reciprocal escalation

**Mercy vs. Honor**:
- Johnny learns to distinguish between mercy and honor
- Honor is about showing respect for the other, as opposed to hatred and conflict
- Honoring opponents by not attacking when they are down limits violence and provides an alternative model

**The Consequences of Violence**:

- He renounces all ties to Cobra Kai and the creed he once espoused
- Johnny refuses to engage in vengeance, despite having the opportunity

**Spiritual and Ethical Lessons**:
- The teachings of mimetic theory are reflected in the series
- The connection between Christianity, as understood by Girard, and the martial arts is explored


#### Mimetic desire in literature and martial arts: Girard's theory on self and conflict in The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai

**Mimetic Desire and Spiritual Growth in The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai**

**Johnny's Transformation:**
- Fixated on Daniel as model due to beliefs: Ali will like him, Daniel is successful
- Beliefs not necessarily true
- Suffers personal cost to turn away from mimetic conflict
- Learns to cultivate universal desires like benevolence and honor

**Daniel's Struggle:**
- Had a good master but never finds peace
- Self-victory more important than victory over self

### 09. The Pleasures and Perils of Revenge

**Sons of Anarchy: The Pleasures and Perils of Revenge**

**The Destructive Fury of Revenge**:
- One of the main themes of Sons of Anarchy
- Drama about the moral struggles of Jackson "Jax" Teller, VP/President of the outlaw Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club (SAMCRO)
- Set in the fictional town of Charming, where SAMCRO uses intimidation and graft to control the town while engaging in illegal gun-running and smuggling

**Transitioning from Violence to Porn**:
- Jax works to extricate SAMCRO from the violent criminal underworld
- Secures the club's financial security through legitimate pornography and escort businesses
- This transition could be seen as a "happy ending," but the story is a tragedy

**Jax's Revenge**:
- Jax is haunted by the ghost of his murdered father, John "J.T." Teller
- Avenges his father's murder by executing the club's president, Clay Morrow (the "Claudius" figure)
- Also racks up a significant body count, like in Shakespeare's Hamlet

**Girard's Analysis**:
- Sons of Anarchy parallels the theme of revenge in William Shakespeare's Hamlet
- Revenge can be seen as an imperative or a duty, but it also has perils
- The audience's sympathy for the avenger requires that the victim was innocent and the perpetrator truly guilty


#### Revenge: Bible's lex talionis and Sons of Anarchy's violent justice. Eye for an eye.

**Revenge Tragedy: The Pleasures and Perils of Revenge**

**Conditions for Satisfying Moral Catharsis**
- **Innocence of the victim**: Sutter violates this condition by having Tara not be an innocent victim (Leviticus 24:19–20).
- **Guilt of the target**: Jax believes Lin ordered the hit on Tara, but it was actually a misunderstanding (eye for an eye principle).

**The Eye of Revenge: Lex Talionis**
- Biblical concept of retributive justice (Leviticus 24:19–20)
- Mirrored punishments based on the crime committed

**Examples in Sons of Anarchy**
- Moses Cartwright: Jax maims him as a response to his own injury.
- Agent June Stahl: Opie makes her experience the same pain inflicted on his wife Donna.
- Chris Dun and Henry Lin: Jax kills them in the same manner as Tara's death.

**Innocent Victims Substituted for Eyes and Teeth**
- Diosa Norte escorts: SAMCRO attacks them as a substitute for eyes and teeth (Poor Little Lambs).

**Additional Information**
- The lex talionis is a universal concept found in many ancient legal codes.
- Jax Teller likely has an instinctive understanding of the underlying principle, despite not reading Leviticus.


#### Revenge, reciprocity, and biblical allusions in Sons of Anarchy and human morality

**The Beautiful Symmetry of Revenge (Sons of Anarchy)**

**Lex Talionis and Penal Substitution**:
- Cameron threatens Jax's son Abel with a knife, musing "A son for a son seems about right" ("Na Trioblóidí")
- Damon Pope's daughter Veronica was killed by Tig Trager. He tells Tig "Now you feel my pain," before immolating his daughter Dawn and forcing him to witness the holocaust ("Sovereign"). A "daughter for a daughter."
- These episodes exhibit both lex talionis (an "eye for an eye") and penal substitution, where one person is made to suffer a penalty that rightfully belongs to another.

**Biblical Allusions in Sons of Anarchy**:
- The Bible's "mercy" theme runs from the Pentateuch to the Psalms to the Gospels, contrasting with the stream of blood that runs through the narratives.
- Girard argues this reflects the Bible's emergence from a violent archaic world, where "the law of retribution is very real."
- The outlaw subculture of SAMCRO is an atavistic enclave of that same archaic world within modernity.

**The Satisfaction of Retribution**:
- Many find the symmetry and balance of "eye for an eye" retribution satisfying, even though it can be barbaric.
- This may reflect a natural human tendency to reciprocate, rewarding favors and requiting harms.
- "Good reciprocity" (e.g., Jax bribing the sheriff) is often disguised to avoid devolving into revenge.
- The idea of deriving aesthetic pleasure from well-proportioned acts of vengeance may be barbaric, but is seen in works like Dante's Divine Comedy.


#### Comparing justice and revenge in Sons of Anarchy: proportionality and consequences.

**The Pleasures and Perils of Revenge**

**Justice and Punishment**:
- Ideal of making punishment "fit" the crime is at the heart of our conception of justice
- Criminal justice system prescribes ranges of penalties for crimes, scaled according to gravity
- Even if we can't replicate specifics of pain/injury, we want perpetrators to experience proportional intensity

**Lady Justice and Balance**:
- "Justice is just the principle of equality" - Kant
- Balance disrupted by crime represented by Lady Justice holding scales
- Punishment should restore the balance

**Revenge vs. Retributive Justice**:
- Some philosophers draw hard line between revenge and retributive justice
- Revenge lacks concern for proportion, while retribution sets internal limits
- Concern for balance and proportion can be present in revenge

**Examples of Measured Revenge**:
- Clay's punishment of Half-Sack (sleeping with Cherry) was proportional to offense
- Jax's drive to avenge Tara's death was a "disagreeable burden" and "abhorrent duty"

**Legal System vs. Vengeance**:
- Revenge can be felt as painful, even odious, moral responsibility
- Modern world has become uncomfortable with vengeance being doled out by private individuals
- Due process safeguards help avoid going after the wrong person, but also leads to mistakes (e.g., innocent prosecutions)


#### The dangers of revenge and the power of forgiveness in archaic societies.

**The Dangers of Private Vengeance: Revenge vs Sacrifice**

**Archaic Societies**:
- Lack of legal system to punish on behalf of victims
- Resulted in escalating violence between parties who feel righteous
- Scapegoating and ritual sacrifice as means to discharge community's violence

**Sons of Anarchy (SOA)**:
- Revenge plot against Clay Morrow:
  - Collective murder by SAMCRO members
  - Averted danger of escalation, serving as a "founding murder" for new order
- Absence of forgiveness in SOA world
  - Lack of power and safety for outlaws like Jax Teller
  - Honor demands swift retaliation to restore tarnished image

**Scapegoating vs Forgiveness**:
- Scapegoat mechanism: Unity through directing all pent-up hostility at a single individual
- Collective murder can reconcile community when everyone is on board and victim has no allies
- Forgiveness as an alternative to vengeance
  - Capable of stopping the spiral of reprisals
  - Commanded in New Testament, but showcased in Old Testament stories

**Joseph's Story**:
- Sold into slavery by brothers but pardons them later
- Forgiveness as an option for Jax Teller but not feasible due to outlaw life and honor code.


#### Exploring themes of violence, revenge, and redemption in "Sons of Anarchy" through religious symbolism.

**Sons of Anarchy: The Ultimate Sacrifice**

**The Beauty of Forgiveness vs. Revenge**
- Jax rejects message of redemption and new creation (symmetry of revenge)
- Love leads to self-sacrifice for friends
- Final image: bread allusion to Eucharist, "Jesus," serene face of Jax

**The Influence of René Girard's Thoughts on the Text**
- Violence and sacred (lex talionis)
- Capitalism vs. mimetic phenomena
- Natural Right and History by Leo Strauss
- A Theater of Envy: William Shakespeare

**Sons of Anarchy: Themes of Old Testament Justice and Passover Metaphor**
- "Old Testament justice": harsh, merciless punishment based on lex talionis
- Sacrifice of Christ as Paschal Lamb (freedom from sin)
- Misreadings and misunderstandings of Paul's use of the metaphor

**Atonement Theories: Penal Substitution vs. Ransom Theory**
- Penal substitution: sacrifice paid for sins
- Ransom theory: death of Christ as payment to Satan to release humans from debt due to sin.

**René Girard's Views on Pental Substitution and Atonement Theory**
- Non-sacrificial reading of Gospel text (Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World)
- Sacrificial reading of historical Christianity.


#### A critique of the doctrine of penal substitution and René Girard's thoughts on violence, revenge, and scapegoating in religion with references to various philosophers and texts.

**Girard's Critique of Penal Substitution:**
- **Anthony Bartlett**: Book-length critique of penal substitution doctrine in Cross Purposes (Trinity Press, 2001)
- **Mark S. Heim**: Developed a Girardian theology of atonement in Saved from Sacrifice: A Theology of the Cross (Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2006)
- **Michael Hardin**: Practical Reflections on Non-Violent Atonement in Violence, Desire, and the Sacred, Volume 2 (Bloomsbury Academic, 2014)

**Girard's Views on Violence:**
- **Generative Scapegoating**: Absence from New Testament except as object of criticism; found throughout Old Testament/Tanakh (Violent Origins: Walter Burkert, René Girard and Jonathan Z. Smith)
- Morally motivated violence can lead to complications and hard feelings (Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics)

**Justice vs. Revenge:**
- **Immanuel Kant**: Justice is doing good to friends and harm to enemies in Philosophy of Law
- Girard criticizes this definition, proposing that good reciprocity may lead to escalating cycles of vengeance due to different arithmetics (Things Hidden)
- Leniency or forgiveness possible under Mosaic Law's lex talionis (Violence and the Sacred)

**Importance of Reputation:**
- In outlaw biker world, reputation plays a significant role (George A. Dunn's "SAMCRO versus the Leviathan")

**Notable Quotes from Girard:**
- "Revenge" lecture at Center for International Security and Arms Control at Stanford University (1993)
- "Generative Scapegoating" in Violent Origins: Walter Burkert, René Girard and Jonathan Z. Smith on Ritual Killing and Cultural Formation
- A Theatre of Envy, I See Satan Fall Like Lightning, Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World, Violence and the Sacred.

- Eisner's final graphic novel, The Plot, exposes the mythic nature of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion
- Umberto Eco identifies these myths as "Big Lies" that fuel hatred and violence against specific groups
- From a Jewish perspective, Eisner's work is inspired by prophetic Judaism which critiques archaic religions' violent scapegoating.

**Conclusion:**
- Humanity still needs to confront the need to single out an enemy despite exposure of myths and their consequences.

* Foundation: scapegoat sacrifice to restore harmony and quell violence
* Girard's understanding of myth: conceals founding violence (sacrificial crises)
* Johnny Storm, aka Human Torch, becomes sun and god on Battleworld after opposing God-Doom
* Peace restored through sacrifice, blamed on victim
* Victim seen as savior, divine being
* Myth hides truth of scapegoat's role in quelling violence

**Girard's Theory of Scapegoat:**
* Foundation of every myth: scapegoat sacrifice
* Diverts community's violent impulses
* Restores harmony and reinforces social fabric
* Peace attributed to victim itself
* Sacrifice conceals truth of troubled state of the community

**Battleworld's Scapegoat: Molecule Man**
* Owen Reece, Molecule Man, is a bomb created by Beyonders for multiverse destruction
* Single consciousness shared across all space and time
* Concealed truth covered up by myth
* Killed himself in another universe to thwart Beyonder's plan
* Dr. Doom kills Molecule Men to protect anonymity and spread violence
* Followers, the Swans, carry on mission unaware of true reason for sacrifices.

**Girardian Parallels:**
* Solitary sacrificial victim (Molecule Man)
* Obfuscation of myth to hide true reason for killing sacrificial victim
* Sacrifice diverts violence and destruction from community.


#### Marvel Comics' Dr. Doom's Mimetic Rivalry and Unfulfilled Desire for Being.

**Sacrificial Crisis in Battleworld**

**Victims as Causes of Conflict:**
- Owen Reece, aka Molecule Man, initially seen as the cause of sacrificial crisis
- Retrospectively honored and even divinized after the fact
- Doom, Dr. Strange, and Molecule Man defeated Beyonders by creating additional Molecule Men, destroying them and allowing Reece to channel Beyonders' power into Doom

**Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) vs. Dr. Doom:**
- Longstanding rivalry since college days
- Doom blames Reed for accident that disfigured him, leading to lifelong pursuit of vengeance
- Real desire is not Reed's possessions but Reed's very being - Doom wants to be Reed
- Doom hates Reed as an obstacle and mediator, admires him secretly

**Dr. Doom's Discontent:**
- Dissatisfied with life on Battleworld despite having power, family, and dominion over the universe
- Desires being more than objects or possessions
- Mimetic rivals seek being, not just objects of desire

**Reed Richards' Return:**
- Doom confronts Reed during Secret Wars #4, demands surrender and bow before him
- Doom hates Reed as the mediator who prevents him from obtaining his deepest desires
- Ultimately, it's about admiration for Reed, not just acquiring objects or power.


#### Sacrificial crisis in Marvel multiverse and religious myth unraveling. Reed Richards as revelatory agent.

**Sacrificial Crisis and Divinity in Marvel Universe:**
* Doom's world: creation of religion around himself to hide discrepancies (Secret Wars #6)
* Reed Richards vs Doom: unraveling of myth leads to war for divinity (Battleworld falls apart, Secret Wars #7)
* Revealing victims' innocence and ending the sacrificial crisis: Christianity as a revelatory agent (Girard's thought)
* Reed Richards as revelatory figure but not Christ figure due to violence involvement.

**Battleworld:**
* Doom builds world based on myth, Strange monitors discrepancies
* Removal of religious misconception leads to disaster: war for divinity
* Battleworld falls apart, Marvel universe reboots (Secret Wars #7)

**Sacrificial Crisis and Religion:**
* Protection against human violence by maintaining ignorance (Girard)
* Doom's godhood questioned, Black Panther confronts him with army of undead
* Reed attempts to find source of Doom's power: The Molecule Man
* Unmasking the myth: end of sacrificial crisis?

**Reed Richards:**
* Appearance on Battleworld initiates unraveling of Doom's myth
* Revelatory figure but not Christ figure due to violence involvement.

**Christianity and Sacrifice:**
* Demystification of religion through Christianity (Girard)
* Ending the cycle of retaliation, revealing innocence
* Reed Richards: product of Christian revelation?
* Love and healing enemies: Christ-like action.

**Notes:**
1. The eternal return in Marvel universe vs our world (Girard's thought)
2. The role of religion in protecting humanity from violence
3. The significance of unraveling mythical narratives
4. Reed Richards as a revelatory figure and potential Christ figure.


### 12. From Autonomy to Annihilation

**Robert Grant Price's Essay on Mimetic Desire and Romantic Lie**

**Mimetic Theory by René Girard:**
- Human desire models itself after others, leading to competition and violence
- Desire for another's being: "desire will never lead to self-fulfillment but only to alienation, despair, and spiritual death"

**Romantic Lie vs. Novelistic Conversion:**
- Romantic novels hide mimetic process, promoting individual uniqueness (delusional)
- Novelistic novels reveal mechanisms of mediated desire and humble characters through confronting interdependence

**Three Characters and the Romantic Lie:**
1. **Victor Frankenstein**: Seeks God-like power to create new life, creates monster instead, abandons it
   - Embodies archetype of rebel angel for modern times
   - Turns to alchemical and occult science
2. **Dr. Henry Jekyll & Mr. Hyde**: Tragic figure who lets violent pervert loose in London
3. **Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk)**: Unleashes green monster that wants to kill everybody

**Romantic Lie vs. Reality:**
- Falling for the ultimate romantic lie: believing one can compete with God and create like Him
- Prideful self-assertion leads to failure, ultimately requiring forgiveness for atonement

**Popular Culture's Role:**
- Negative exemplars of Girard's theory of conversion in pop culture texts
- Characters often portrayed as independent heroes, triumphant through originality and guts.


#### Exploring mediated desire and monstrous doubles in "Frankenstein" and "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."

**Frankenstein's Monster and Mimetic Desire:**

**The Monster's Search for Identity**
- Seeks instruction from characters in books he reads (mediated desire)
- Models himself after Werther and Lucifer
- Rebels against his Creator, like Lucifer
- Innocent at birth but becomes a scapegoat due to societal accusations

**Frankenstein as Satan/Accuser**
- Imitates Satanic figures (Lucifer)
- Contempt for God, desires to upset His order
- Accuses the monster, leading to scapegoating ritual

**Mimetic Doubling in Frankenstein**
- Both Frankenstein and monster are the same person
- Both pursue the goal of undoing creation
- Both fail in their missions and succumb to self-destruction

**Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mimetic Desire**
- Seeks to remake humanity through potion
- Transforms into Edward Hyde, embodiment of desires
- Indulges dark desires, leading to increased power of disordered desire
- Unable to separate self from desires, ultimately kills himself

**Conclusion:**
- Mimetic desire and scapegoating mechanism present in both stories
- Humanity's creations cannot rival God's creation due to inferiority
- Failure to understand love leads to destructive consequences.


#### Jekyll's Self-Centered Desires Lead to Hyde's Violence: A Study in Scapegoating and Surrender.

**The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde**

**Jekyll's Self-Centeredness**:
- Jekyll creates a separate identity (Mr. Hyde) to house his "desires"
- This allows him to commit crimes without feeling guilt or responsibility
- He accuses Mr. Hyde of the "disorder and violence" when it threatens his own life and conscience

**The Scapegoating of Hyde**:
- Jekyll's plan to isolate his "desires" from his conscience was diabolical and Satanic
- He wanted to destroy the criminal party (Mr. Hyde) with an unimpeachable righteousness
- However, he failed to understand the unity of his person and the consequences of his actions

**The Tragedy of Jekyll**:
- Jekyll's self-centeredness led him to believe he was two people: himself (the good man) and Mr. Hyde (the evil one)
- He surrendered to his self-centered desires, which led to the fall into becoming Mr. Hyde
- This choice was irreversible, like a "tumble down a greased pipe"

**The Hulk as a Reimagining of Jekyll**:
- The Incredible Hulk debuted in 1962 as a retelling of The Strange Case for the Nuclear Age
- Dr. Bruce Banner transforms into the Hulk when he becomes enraged, reflecting Jekyll's struggle with his passions
- Later iterations of the Hulk explored his abuse by an abusive father and his desire to remake creation


#### Tragedy of Prideful Genius: Three Doctors and the Human Condition

**The Luciferian Desire of Banner/Hulk**
- **Redemption**: Can Banner/Hulk gain control over his desires or succumb to dark desires like Jekyll?
- Depends on who mediates the Hulk's desire:
  - David Banner, Banner's violent father, duplicated his need to assert control through violence
- **Scapegoating**: Produces a fragile, temporary peace. Violence will return until one party vanquishes the other.
- Jekyll can destroy Hyde, but peace comes when they order their desires.

**The Tragedy of the Proud Genius**
- Each character:
  - Discovers they have become evil in pursuit of power to recreate themselves
  - Realizes they will be judged a failure and condemned as evil
  - Blames others for their crimes before atoning
- Similarities to Frankenstein, Jekyll, and Banner's iterations
  - Desire for godly power, bringing violence into the world, blaming others

**The Mythic Recapitulation**
- Modern retellings of myth point back to ancient violence
- Stories of the three doctors recapitulate the same myth
- Conceal cultural guilt from ancient ritual executions of innocents

**Pride as Original Sin**
- God cursed the snake and the ground, not Adam and Eve
- Knowledge of evil is an undeniable aspect of human nature
- Each doctor indulges "the deceptive divinity of pride", learns the meaning of evil by becoming evil

**Renouncing Pride**
- Classical Christian theology: Salvation is external, but the choice to accept it is ours
- We cannot fix ourselves alone; we need others' help
- Pride brings tragedy as the doctors battle their monsters alone when others could have helped


#### Analysis of novels and their exploration of human desire, pride, and renunciation through the works of René Girard.

**The Dangers of Pride and the Power of Renunciation**

**Pride as a Destructive Force**:
- Leads to self-destruction
- Prevents embracing the "novelistic truth"
- Causes individuals to close themselves off from others
- Leads to scapegoating and violence

**Frankenstein's Repudiation of Pride**:
- Frankenstein is repulsed by his own monster and pride
- Warns against the dangers of pride
- Tries to vanquish the monster, but dies trying to save humanity

**Jekyll's Ambivalent Repentance**:
- Jekyll expresses remorse to God, but does not fully take ownership of his crimes
- Sacrifices himself, but it reads more like an escape than a act of atonement

**Banner's Ongoing Struggle**:
- Banner continues to play "God" and becomes trapped in the romantic lie
- Remains an antagonist rather than the hero who overcomes his desire

**The Importance of Renunciation and Love**:
- Only by renouncing pride can love for others become possible
- This requires seeking help, discipline, or a model to guide the way

**Conclusion**:
- Pride destroys, while rejecting violence and self-worship leads to liberation.


### 13. Subtweeting in the End Times

**Social Media and the Escalation to Extremes**

**Cultural Obsession with Violence**:
- Michel Serres lamented the cultural obsession with violence
- Advanced technologies are thrusting our culture back to the "archaic age of sacrificial polytheism"

**Social Media and Mimetic Phenomena**:
- Social media platforms demonstrate mimetic phenomena, including:
  - Scapegoat mechanism
  - Multiplication of victims
  - Escalation to extremes

**Computer Mediated Communication (CMC)**:
- Accelerates the "escalation to extremes"
- Blurs the boundaries between digital and embodied lives
- Attenuates empathy
- Disinhibits behavior
- Lowers barriers to violence

**The Twitter Hate Machine**:
- Outrage over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation led to a "mimetic crisis"
- Progressive and conservative groups polarized, deepening unanimity within each coalition
- Calls for doxxing and shaming Covington Catholic High School students
- New footage revealed a different narrative, but the damage was already done

**Conclusion**:
- The need for peace remains, as the more radical the crisis of the sacrificial system becomes, the more people will be tempted to multiply victims.


#### The text discusses the role of mimetic desire and scapegoating in contemporary society, using examples from politics and social media. It explores how our brains are ill-equipped to navigate online spaces and the impact on behavior.

**Covington Catholic High School Controversy**

**Background:**
- Student never moved from position before being approached by Phillips
- Progressives labeled school as embracing white supremacy based on basketball player's "OK" hand gesture
- False narratives spread quickly due to ideological homogeneity in mainstream news organizations
- Exculpatory footage ignored or overlooked

**Impact:**
- Narrative used to smear anti-abortion movement as racist
- Threats of violence against the boys ensued
- Phillips attempted similar incident at National Shrine during mass

**Scapegoating and Mimetics:**
- Progressives and conservatives fixate on each other, becoming "mimetic doubles"
- Omar's scapegoating led to her own scapegoating by Republicans
- Intersectionality requires solidarity through scapegoating
- Any community focused on victimage has a mythical lie at its core for survival

**Online Disinhibition:**
- Social media amplifies and contorts behavior, leading to toxic environments
- Brains ill-equipped to navigate online spaces
- Mirror neurons underlie imitation and human development
- Embodied simulation establishes empathy with others

**Trolls:**
- Male trolls are high in trait psychopathy and sadism, low in affective empathy
- Trolling causes emotional distress without empathizing with victims
- Trolling behavior is often anarchic rather than raison d'être.


#### Online disinhibition, toxic behavior, emotional contagion, cyberbullying, social media effects, mimetics, and violence.

**Online Disinhibition: Behavior and Its Consequences**

**Disinhibitory Effect of Online Environments:**
- Reduces impact of authority (dissociative imagination, minimization)
- Impedes normal social cues for behavior modulation
- Increases vulnerability to emotional contagion

**Factors Contributing to Online Disinhibition:**
1. Dissociative anonymity: Behavior not linked to personal identity
2. Invisibility: Lack of eye contact, information about others' status
3. Asynchronicity: Delayed responses leading to misinterpretations
4. Solipsistic introjection: Focus on self in online interactions
5. Dissociative imagination: Disinhibited fantasy and role-playing
6. Minimization of status and authority: Flattening of distinctions

**Online Behavior and Real-World Consequences:**
1. Cyberbullying leading to violent offline responses (cyberbanging)
2. Escalation of conflict through social media platforms
3. Blurring boundaries between online and offline worlds
4. Spreading disinformation, extremism, hate speech

**Online Disinhibition Enhanced by Artificial Means:**
- Russian botnets influencing elections (Brexit, US election)
- Sockpuppets amplifying hateful content on 4chan
- Mimetic desire manipulation leading to artificial crises.

**Impact of Online Disinhibition:**
1. Emotional contagion spreading like a virus
2. Real-world consequences, such as violence and persecution
3. Blurring the boundaries between online and offline worlds.


#### Mimetic Crisis in the Digital Age: Violence and Social Media

**Mimetic Reciprocity and Social Media: The End Times According to René Girard**

**Introduction:**
- Pew Research Center study: hyperpartisan members of Congress gain more Twitter followers
- Russian sockpuppets and botnets amplify messages after organic growth
- Example of #Pizzagate conspiracy theory

**Mimetic Crisis and Violence:**
- Reciprocal action provokes and suspends escalation to extremes (Clausewitz)
- Collapsing time and space in social media: anyone can become a mimetic rival at any moment
- Mimetic crisis: danger threatens, but salvation also grows

**Girard's Perspective:**
- Embraced pessimism in his final two decades
- Humanity must renounce violence and embrace Christ to be saved
- The return of Christ: great and terrible Day of the Lord
- Fight for truth through positive reciprocity, escaping negative reciprocity (lex talionis)

**Enemy Identification:**
- Satan as the Accuser: process of mimetic rivalry itself
- Deprive us of protection against negative mimesis
- Obey Christ and cultivate peace, excise practices vulnerable to negative mimesis.

**Conclusion:**
- Fight for truth requires right identification of enemy (Satan)
- Altering how we use social media: radically.


#### Analysis of societal issues in a post-Christian context, exploring scapegoating, social media, and desire, with references to René Girard's theories.

**Michel Serres on René Girard: Receiving Girard into the Académie Française**
- Michel Serres wrote about receiving René Girard into the Académie Française (2009)
- Mentioned Girard's work on the Gospels and Christianity's influence in society

**Post-Christian Society**:
- Characterized by a moral imagination no longer tethered to orthodox Christian faith
- Emphasis on "Remixed religion" category (Tara Isabella Burton, 2020)

**René Girard's Views:**
- Believed the Gospels contain both fact and mythical elements
- Wrote "Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World" (1987)

**Societal Impact of Misinformation**:
- Mentioned examples of misinformation spread during Covington controversy (2019)
  - Students falsely accused of harassing Native American elder
  - Media coverage led to death threats and threats against their lives
- Similar incidents involving Rep. Ilhan Omar (2017-present)
  - Accused of being pro-BDS, antisemitic comments
  - Received extensive media attention and death threats

**Mimetic Theory and Online Behavior:**
- People can become "trolls" when feeling anonymous and disinhibited online
- Social norms and anonymity contribute to aggressive language use in online comments
- Experimental evidence shows mass-scale emotional contagion through social media (Kramer et al., 2014)

**Global Impact of Digital Media:**
- Increasing global internet use (Simon Kemp, 2019)
- Can lead to intractable conflicts and attitudes that perpetuate division
- Examples: Chicago gang wars, China's mass detentions of Muslims

**Conclusion:**
- René Girard's work continues to have significant implications for understanding societal dynamics in a post-Christian era, particularly regarding the impact of digital media on human behavior.

### 14. Starving for Beauty

**Chapter 14: Starving for Beauty on Anorexia and Mimetic Desire**

**The Rise of Thin Ideal and Eating Disorders:**
- Cultural trend towards low-calorie diets and weight loss
- Increased presence of food competitions, recipes, and celebrity chefs in media
- Westernized ideal spreading globally, leading to rise in eating disorders (EDs) diagnoses

**Girard's Perspective:**
- Introduced connection between contemporary culture and anorexia at a conference in 1995
- Provided useful explanation of mimetic devices operating behind EDs
- Focused on female sufferers, but some male diagnoses were reported even then

**Expanding Girard's Research:**
1. Eating disorders are not exclusive to females: males and other genders also affected
2. Ascetic Christian practices not the sole cause of EDs; spiritual practices may assist in mitigating them
3. Globalization spreading negative portrayals of food in Western media, leading to increased pressure for thinness worldwide

**Girard's Findings:**
- Nine out of ten sufferers were women at that time
- Blame Christian church for EDs problematic: religious principles could be disregarded with impunity
- Focused on Western perspective, ignoring Eastern countries and their cultural ideals

**Implications:**
- Expand research into gender dynamics of eating disorders beyond female dominance
- Consider spiritual practices as potential assistance in curing or mitigating disordered eating
- Acknowledge the influence of globalization on spreading negative messages about food and body image, leading to increased pressure for thinness worldwide.


#### Analyzing gender and religious influences on eating disorders, beyond mimetic rivalry.

**Gender and Eating Disorders**

**Claim**: EDs are found among a variety of gendered, global populations.
- Diagnoses of anorexia are not the same across genders
- Gendered biases persist for different reasons

**Causation and Misconceptions**
- Researchers assume typical male sufferer is athletic
- Association between eating disorders, body talk, and males did not differ greatly between athletes and nonathletes
- Inaccurate and incomplete notions of what the anorexic looks like remain
- Those who are both anorexic and atypical strive to fall in line with the idealized figure

**Mimetic Rivalry**
- Mimetic rivalry phenomenon: competition between Sisi and Eugenie led to disordered eating among aristocratic women
- Women crafted bigger feasts as a way of outdoing one another
- Desire for thinness seen as entertainment and mimetic desire

**Girard's Perspective**
- Clear understanding of mimetic underpinnings in anorexia cases
- Medical minds are slower to catch on
- Treatment and diagnosis difficulties due to inaccurate perceptions

**Religion: Ascetic Anorexics**
- Gender not the only influence Girard fails to consider fully
- No devotion to considering spirituality, religion, and EDs relationship
- Fastening between religious asceticism and anorexia is complex

**Spirituality and Treatment**
- Studies show spirituality and religion play important role in treatment and recovery
- Connection between religion, other spiritual practices, and etiology of eating disorders
- Religion can support treatment for an eating disorder.


#### Eating Disorders: Complex Global Issue Beyond Religion and Gender Boundaries.

**Impact of Religion on Eating Disorders: A Complex Relationship**

**Background:**
- Anorexia and Mimetic Desire: disconnect between cultural edicts and increased mimetic rivalry (Strand)
- Girard's perspective: rejection of oppressive cultural edicts led to increased rivalry with a price
- Modern research: faith-based practices linked to body satisfaction and less likelihood of eating disorders

**Findings:**
1. **Body satisfaction and religious customs:** positive associations among various faith groups, such as Muslims, Christians, and Belizean women
2. **Recovery through faith:** returning to spiritual beliefs aids patients in recovery from eating disorders
3. **Globalization's role:** EDs becoming a global health concern due to societal changes and urbanization
4. **Impact on developing nations:** Africa seeing rise in eating disorders with exposure to Western media and culture
5. **Treatment considerations:** region-specific practices based on cultural religious beliefs, treatment options must take into account global factors contributing to EDs.

**Implications:**
- Religion cannot be blamed for the increase of eating disorders but can be a means of treating rivalry before it spreads further
- Further research needed: replication of studies and examinations of EDs in developing regions, consideration of treatment options including spirituality.


#### Exploring the role of religion in eating disorders: a scholarly perspective.

**The Connection Between Religion, Spirituality, and Eating Disorders**

**Background:**
- René Girard's perspective on eating disorders and religion: Anorexia and Mimetic Desire (2013)
- Impact of media on eating disorders
- Role of body talk in men with EDs

**Key Points**:

**Eating Disorders and Religion/Spirituality:**
- Girard's perspective: Anorexia as a form of mimetic desire (Girard, 2013)
  - Discussed exclusively in medical terms, ignoring cultural influences
- Studies suggest religion/spirituality can help mitigate negative factors of EDs
  - Body dissatisfaction reduction: Richards et al., 2018
- Importance of considering spirituality in eating disorder treatment and recovery

**Media's Role in Eating Disorders:**
- Food media messages are multilayered and contradictory (Foragacs et al., 2018)
- Connection between access to cooking-based media and diagnosed EDs (Francisco-Natanauan et al., 2013)
- Eating disorders discussed primarily in medical terms, ignoring cultural influences (Girard, 2013)

**Body Talk and Men with EDs:**
- Body talk: expressing concerns about body type (Ahlich et al., 2019)
- Twice as often visit food websites and watch cooking shows as women without EDs (Francisco-Natanauan et al., 2013)

**Girard's Perspective on Eating Disorders:**
- Mild form of bulimia a common experience for many individuals (Girard, 2013)
- Eating disorders have a beginning, middle, and end
- Scholars, spiritual advisors, and medical practitioners working on understanding and treating EDs further

**Historical Context:**
- From Fasting Saints to Anorexic Girls: A History of Self-Starvation (Vandereycken & van Deth, 2019)
  - Historical examples of self-starvation for spiritual purposes
- Marya Hornbacher's Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia (1999)
  - Personal struggle with eating disorders and the connection to religion/salvation.


#### Anorexia, Mimetic Desire, and the Role of Values and Spirituality in Eating Disorders.

**Impact of Western Values on Eating Disorders (EDs)**

**Girard's Perspective**:
- Removal of church and its values can lead to unhealthy life choices for children
- Increase in disordered eating behavior among women employed by tourism industry due to globalization

**Spirituality and Eating Disorders**:
- Spiritual texts recognize important role in recovery from EDs
- Popular culture slower to acknowledge this connection

**Cultural Influence on EDs**:
- Exposure to Western cultures, especially in highly educated persons, increases risk for developing an eating disorder (da Silva et al., 2017)
- Media exposure also plays a role in the development of EDs (Eddy et al., 2007)

**Media and Eating Disorders**:
- Women with EDs may be more exposed to media messages related to body image and eating disorders (Forgács et al., 2018)
- Media use can affect adolescent women with EDs beyond what meets the senses (Francisco-Natanauan et al., 2013)

**Spiritual Texts on Eating Disorders**:
- Numerous books address spiritual side of recovery from EDs (Cruse, 2006; Goldwasser, 2010; Shaw, 2014; White, 2018)

**Conclusion**:
- Western values and globalization can contribute to the development of eating disorders
- Spiritual texts recognize the role they can play in recovery from EDs.


### 15. From MeToo to WeToo

**Mimetic Ecclesiology and #MeToo/WeToo Moment**
* Society's attention to voices of abuse victims leads to reckoning for institutions
* Catholic Church undergoes own #MeToo moment, acknowledging abuse beyond sexual harassment
* Girardian perspective used to examine response through mimetic ecclesiology
	+ James Alison's reflections on Church systematized by Grant Kaplan
	+ Characteristics of mimetic ecclesiology:
		- **Gratuity of forgiveness**: Christ's appearance to disciples in upper room as invitation for reimagination
		- **New idea of relationship**: Church rooted in unity, not reciprocity or vengeance
		- **Undefensive ecclesiology**: Counterbalance to defensive forms of apologetic
		- **Inclusive belonging**: All members forgiven as sinners, enabling new patterns of human relationship
* Alison's ecclesiology based on peace and forgiveness in the Resurrection
* Need for an ecclesiological apologetic that is not defensive
* Acts 10:28 as earth-shattering event breaking down exclusionary walls for Church membership.


#### Fundamental ecclesiology: Church as victimless sacred and faith beyond resentment.

**Alison's Ecclesiology: Seven Themes**

**Theme 1:**
- Church founded in free gift of graced forgiveness and friendship from Risen Christ
- Invites followers into new community based on forgiveness instead of vengeance
- Undefined ecclesiology grounded in Alison's reading of Scripture

**Theme 2:**
- Cultivate sense of indifference toward Church in its institutionality
- Represents being and belonging in the Church in a nonmimetic fashion

**Theme 3:**
- Eucharistic/liturgical abiding in the Church as means for nonmimetic community

**Theme 4:**
- Model of victimless sacred: giving people means to grow spiritually

**Theme 5:** (Implicit)
- Importance of forgiveness and friendship in the Church

**Questioning Alison's Ecclesiology:**

**Questioned Theme:**
- Role of justified anger in reforming church structures

**Counterargument:**
- Jesus showed justified anger towards Temple and money changers, not indifference.

**Additional Points for Discussion:**
- How does the presence of justified anger contribute to the growth of spiritual maturity within the Church?
- Can a community truly be called nonmimetic if it does not acknowledge and address instances of unjust actions within its ranks?
- Is there room for both forgiveness and righteous indignation in Alison's ecclesiology?


#### Exploring the role of interruption in spiritual growth and ecclesiastical change.

**Alison's Perspective on Church and Mimetic Logic:**
* Criticism of structures and Magisterium but trust in Eucharistic liturgy for personal transformation
* Real presence of Crucified and Risen One in consecrated bread and wine creates a space for new sense of being and belonging
* Institutional church can perpetuate mimetic logic, creating scapegoats like gay people
* Individual conversion needed to overcome mimetic logic within structures and institutions
* Eucharist as tool for transformation requires addressing systemic issues
* Interruption by other necessary for breaking open closed narratives

**Alison's Personal Experience:**
* Gay priest who reconciled with Church through self-acceptance
* Institutional church regarded with indifference
* Discerning the mimetic structures within it that made gay people into scapegoats

**The Need for a Systemic Approach:**
* Individual conversion not enough to address institutional issues
* Structures can perpetuate closed narratives and mimetic logic
* Interruption by other required for breaking open closed systems

**God's Intervention as Interruption:**
* God breaks open human narratives throughout history: Abraham, Exodus, Prophets, Jesus
* Jesus is the ultimate interrupter through Paschal Mystery and resurrection
* Followers called to engage in imitatio Christi by interrupting closed personal and collective narratives.


#### Interrupting Church narratives: Sexually abused others and their role in reform.

**The Role of Sexually Abused Others in Ecclesiology**

**Interruption as a Fundamental Element:**
- Jesus' criticism of religious tradition calls for openness to new perspectives
- Interruption serves to honor and respect all experiences and narratives
- Mass media played a crucial role in the #MeToo movement, including revealing patterns of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church

**The Sexually Abused Other as an Agent of Change:**
- Victims' justice was only possible due to mass media and state investigations
- Abuse victims are not just pedophile victims but also those who experienced repressed homosexuality within the priesthood
- Officially focusing on "pedophilia crisis" rather than sexual abuse by gay men serves to stigmatize homosexuality

**Dialogical Interruption:**
- Dialogue between parties is essential for learning and accountability
- Both sides must be willing to learn from each other
