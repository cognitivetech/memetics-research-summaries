# Professor René Girard Professor Yvonne Freccero The Scapegoat 1989

> Widely regarded as one of the most profound critics of our time, René Girard has pursued a powerful line of inquiry across the fields of the humanities and the social sciences. His theories, which the French press has termed "l'hypothèse girardienne," have sparked interdisciplinary, even international, controversy. In The Scapegoat, Girard applies his approach to "texts of persecution," documents that recount phenomena of collective violence from the standpoint of the persecutor―documents such as the medieval poet Guillaume de Machaut's Judgement of the King of Navarre, which blames the Jews for the Black Death and describes their mass murder.
> 
> Girard compares persecution texts with myths, most notably with the myth of Oedipus, and finds strikingly similar themes and structures. Could myths regularly conceal texts of persecution? Girard's answers lies in a study of the Christian Passion, which represents the same central event, the same collective violence, found in all mythology, but which is read from the point of view of the innocent victim. The Passion text provides the model interpretation that has enabled Western culture to demystify its own violence―a demystification Girard now extends to mythology. - [The Scapegoat.

### 1 Guillaume de Machaut and the Jews

**Guillaume de Machaut's "Judgment of the King of Navarre"**

**Background:**
- French poet from mid-fourteenth century
- Known for his work, "Judgment of the King of Navarre"

**Contents of the Text:**
1. **Guillaume's Account**:
   - Participated in a series of catastrophic events
   - Describes improbable occurrences but leaves an impression that something happened
2. **Historical Context:**
   - Text reflects public opinion during that time
   - Fear of the plague was widespread and led to scapegoating
3. **The Jews in Guillaume's Account:**
   - Accused of poisoning rivers and fountains, causing mass deaths
   - Massacre of Jews ensued as a result
4. **Plague and Collective Bad Faith:**
   - People denied the existence of plague due to fear and guilt
   - Scapegoats were sought to explain calamities, including Jews
5. **Guillaume's Perception:**
   - Initially blames Jews for first stages of epidemic
   - Recognizes presence of plague only in later stages
6. **Language as a Scapegoat:**
   - Guillaume uses the Greek word "epydime" instead of the dreaded plague term
7. **Modern Interpretation:**
   - Text may seem susceptible to skepticism regarding historical certainty
   - However, contemporary readers can identify real events in the text

**Key Points:**
- Guillaume de Machaut's "Judgment of the King of Navarre" reflects public opinion during the mid-fourteenth century.
- Fear and guilt led people to blame scapegoats for calamities, including Jews who were accused of poisoning water sources and causing mass deaths.
- The text can be seen as a reflection of collective bad faith where people denied the existence of plague and sought linguistic euphemisms instead.
- Guillaume's use of "epydime" as a scapegoat word for plague shows the process of language being used to avoid acknowledging the actual cause of the disaster.


#### Historical analysis of Guillaume de Machaut's account of the plague and anti-Semitic persecutions: fact versus fiction.

**The Black Death: Guillaume de Machaut's Perspective**

**Background:**
- Guillaume de Machaut's account of the Black Death (plague) in 14th century Europe
- Uncertainty about the nature and cause of the disease
- Misconceptions and scapegoats, including Jews

**Guillaume's Text**:
- Description of events not reliable from historical perspective
- Overlooked context that supports modern readings
- Agreed upon reading: anti-Semitic persecutions occurred during plague

**Historical Context:**
- Other texts provide historical knowledge
- Framework for understanding Guillaume's text
- Lack of reliable sources and specific information
- Difficulty in placing events within the context

**Text Analysis:**
- Impossible to distinguish true from false in the beginning
- Incredible themes: massive scale of poisonings, explicit hatred
- Probable events make unlikely ones more probable
- Textual representations confirm each other

**Guillaume's Perspective:**
- Belief that persecutions were justified
- Convinced he is telling the truth
- Hidden massacres occurred during an overexcited public opinion

**Suspension of General Rule**:
- Text can be worth more than least reliable feature due to its context
- Guillaume's text rooted in a real persecution described from the perspective of perpetrators.


#### Analyzing medieval persecution texts: reality vs. unreliable perspectives.

**Characteristics of Persecution Texts**
- If the text describes circumstances favorable to persecution
- Presents victims that persecutors usually choose
- Represents these victims as guilty of crimes normal­ly attributed by persecutors
- Increases likelihood of real persecution being portrayed

**Perceptions of Persecutors' Accounts**
- Inaccurate but characteristic of medieval persecutors
- Strengthens probability of massacres described in text
- Provides historical context for understanding poisoning allegations

**Importance of Naive Persecutors**
- Unaware they are perpetuating stereotypes
- Conscience prevents systematic deception
- Reveal true nature of persecution through unconscious naiveté

**Limitations of Textual Analysis**
- Critics must consider context and intent of texts
- Stereotypes can be obscured or hidden in some cases
- Importance lies in ambiguous relationships within language

**The Role of the Critic**
- Balancing respect for text with truth about violence portrayed
- Identifying distortions to reveal arbitrary nature of persecution
- Understanding the significance of "persecution texts" as accounts of real violence from a persecutor's perspective.


### 2 Steretypes of Persecution

**Stereotypes of Persecution**

**Collective Persecutions**:
- Acts of violence committed directly by a mob, such as the persecution of the Jews during the Black Death

**Collective Resonances of Persecutions**:
- Acts of violence that are legal in form but stimulated by the extremes of public opinion, like witch-hunts

**Distinction Between Types**:
- Political terrors, such as the French Revolution, often belong to both types

**Circumstances Leading to Collective Persecutions**:
- Generally take place in times of crisis, which weaken normal institutions and favor mob formation
- Spontaneous gatherings of people can exert a decisive influence on weakened institutions and even replace them entirely

**Causes of Collective Persecutions**:
- Cause may be external (e.g., epidemic, severe drought, famine) or internal (e.g., political disturbances, religious conflicts)

**Experience of Collective Persecutions**:
- Extreme loss of social order and the disappearance of rules and cultural divisions
- Descriptions found in great writers, including Thucydides, Sophocles, Lucretius, Boccaccio, Shakespeare, Defoe, Thomas Mann, and Antonin Artaud
- No difference between sources, as all speak of the absence of difference and confusion

**Institutional Collapse**:
- Obliterates hierarchical and functional differences, leading to uniformity in behavior
- Acceleration of positive exchanges (e.g., barter) and increase in negative exchanges (e.g., insults, blows, revenge)
- Corresponds to the reality of human relations but remains mythic

**Stereotype of Crisis**:
- Paradoxical combination of conflictual and solipsistic behavior
- Leads to the eclipse of culture, making it less differentiated
- Causes are often explained by social and moral factors, with blame shifted to society or specific groups

**Accusations in Collective Persecutions**:
- Certain accusations, like specific categories of crimes, are characteristic of collective persecution
- Modern observers look for other stereotypes to confirm their suspicion of violence in the air


#### Persecution mechanisms and scapegoats in history: crimes, poisoning, and stereotypes

**Violent Crimes as Stereotypes of Persecution**

**Fundamental Crimes**:
- Attack foundation of cultural order: king, father, supreme authority, young children, sexual crimes (rape, incest, bestiality), religious crimes (profanation of the host)
- Transgress strictest taboos in society
- Destroy social bonds and distinctions

**Persecution Mechanism**:
- Individuals convinced that a small group or person can harm entire society
- Belief justified by stereotypical accusations made by persecutors
- Stereotypes bridge gap between insignificance of individual and enormity of social body

**Accusation Systems**:
- Transmission of fear and violence from crowd to persecutor
- Mobilization of the crowd into a mob, seeking accessible cause for destruction
- Poisoning accusations: less mythical but weighted down by materiality and logic

**Witch Trials Stereotypes**:
- Nocturnal participation in sabbat
- Criminal activities have social repercussions: abominations, infanticide, religious profanation, incestuous relationships, bestiality, food poisoning, offenses against influential citizens
- Witches engage in activities affecting whole society

**Random vs. Targeted Victims**:
- Crowd's choice of victims may be random or based on susceptible classes
- Ethnic and religious minorities often targeted for persecution


#### Stereotypical reasons for collective persecution: cultural, religious, and physical differences.

**Universal Signs for Victims: Stereotypes in Persecution**

**Criteria for Selecting Victims**:
- Cultural and religious minorities are persecuted universally
- Physical abnormalities, such as sickness, madness, genetic deformities, accidental injuries, and disabilities polarize persecutors
- **Abnormality** is a universal sign of a victim

**Disability as a Banal Sign of Victim**:
- Disabled individuals are subject to discriminatory measures that make them victims, out of proportion to the extent they disturb social exchange
- **Handicapped** is used as a euphemism for those with disabilities
- Individuals who have difficulty adapting, such as new arrivals or orphans, are interchangeable with the "crippled" in certain contexts

**Persecution of the Privileged**:
- In times of crisis, the rich and powerful are also subject to violent persecution by crowds
- The monarch and their court are reminiscent of the "eye of the hurricane" - a double marginality representing social turmoil

**Borderline Between Discrimination and Persecution**:
- Certain forms of discrimination may be considered reasonable, but they can still resemble ancient forms of persecution
- The idea of contagion was initially considered a "persecutor's prejudice" by doctors in the Middle Ages, despite being proven later to be accurate

**Recognizing the Pattern of Persecution**:
- Recognizing the existence of this pattern is important, but determining its relevance can be difficult
- Stereotypes may not always be clearly recognizable in specific events, so it is necessary to consider the presence of other stereotypes as well


#### Persecution stereotypes: differences, victims, intolerance, cultural prejudices, fear of loss of distinctions, and the illusion of uniqueness.

**Stereotypes of Persecution: The Relationship Between Accusations and Collective Violence**

**The Case of Marie Antoinette**
- Interesting light on accusation of incest with son in queen's trial
- Collective violence is not arbitrary but sanctions the deed it purports to condemn
- Distortions of persecution present, even when literal truth is acknowledged

**Perpetrator's Mentality**
- Inversion of relationship between global situation and individual transgression
- Responsibility of victims exaggerated, regardless of their actual guilt or innocence
- Differences between individuals within a system can be threatening and lead to persecution

**The Third Stereotype: Lack of Difference**
- Cultural signs indicate victim's selection based on differences outside the system
- Absence of difference is perceived as threatening and leads to hatred and scapegoating
- Ancestral mechanisms reproduced unconsciously through generations

**Contemporary Pluralism**
- Belief in being free and open to universality
- Fear of compromising this illusion leads to persecution
- Stereotypes of persecution cannot be dissociated, as seen in related words like crisis, crime, criteria, critique (all share a common root)

**The Constant Phenomenon of Persecution**
- Collective persecutions always take the same direction and respond to the same threat
- Relationship between collective persecutions and culture yet unexplained by linguists, philosophers, or politicians.


### 3 What Is a Myth

**What is a Myth?**

**Stereotypes of Persecution**:
- Acts of violence that are directly or indirectly collective
- Descriptions of social and cultural crisis, "generalized loss of differences"
- Crimes that "eliminate differences"
- Victims possessing marks that suggest a guilty relationship with the crisis
- Vioence itself as the import of the operation to lay responsibility on victims

**Mythical Societies**:
- Not exempt from persecution
- Documents contain stereotypes of persecution, following the same total pattern as historical examples
- These documents are myths that must have roots in real acts of violence against real victims

**The Myth of Oedipus**:
- **Sophocles' Account**: Plague ravaging Thebes; Oedipus is responsible for killing father and marrying mother
- **Oracle**: Abominable criminal must be banished to end the plague
- Parricide and incest serve as intermediaries between individual and collective; signs of a victim: disability, exposure as an infant, marginality
- Oedipus's infirmity, past history, situation as foreigner/newcomer/king all make him a "conglomerate of victim's signs"
- Accusations are mythological but criteria for selection may be real
- Conclusion: Real victim behind the text, chosen not for crimes but for victim characteristics that project persecutor paranoia


#### Persecution stereotypes in myths: identifying the true origins of recurring themes.

**The Four Stereotypes of Persecutors**

**Myths as Reflections of Real Persecution**:
- Stereotypical persecutors are prevalent in myths, suggesting real persecutions have occurred
- The only elements of a text written by persecutors that should be believed are:
  - Real circumstances of the text coming into being
  - Characteristic traits of usual victims
  - Results that normally follow collective violence
- If a text describes events as causing plagues and other issues, it may reflect real-world occurrences

**The Case of Oedipus**:
- The myth of Oedipus is a "persecution text" and should be interpreted as such
- Critics argue that historical evidence plays no role in deciphering representations of persecution
- The author argues that the framework of knowledge for understanding historical texts applies equally to myths

**The Importance of Stereotypes**:
- Stereotypes of persecutors, whether in history or myth, provide key indicators of real events
- These stereotypes are a product of the "partly accurate and partly false perspective" of persecutors
- Identifying these stereotypes can dispel obscurity from the text

**The Challenge of Applying this Approach to Myth**:
- The author's method, while obvious in historical texts, is not as readily applied to myths
- This may be due to the lack of independent, unbiased sources in mythology


#### Myth's role in societal crises: Persecution stereotypes and lack of differentiation.

**Myths and Persecution**

**Cultural Schizophrenia**:
- People interpret texts based on their external trappings, not what they really are
- Slight modification of presentation can inhibit or release radical demystification

**Lack of Differentiation in Myths**:
- Myths involve a lack of differentiation between gods, men, and animals
- This is reflected in social crises that trigger collective persecutions
- Can have idyllic or catastrophic connotations

**Crimes in Mythology**:
- Mythologies often excuse or make light of crimes committed by characters
- These crimes correspond to stereotypes of the victims of collective persecutions

**The Stranger as a Mythological Victim**:
- The theme of the foreigner being assassinated by the community is central in world mythology
- The victim is seen as having done something they should not have, leading to their lynching
- This can be traced to a form of "provincialism" where the stranger becomes truly mythological


#### Exploring monstrous representations in mythology and their connection to persecution.

**Mythology and Persecution**
* Representations of persecution serve as an "Ariadne's thread" to guide analysis through mythology (Des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde, pp. 114-40)
* Stereotypes of persecution in myths: monstrous beings that contain elements borrowed from existing forms
	+ Minotaur: man and bull
	+ Dionysus: god with monster traits
	+ Merging of physical deformity and moral monstrosity (bestiality, hermaphroditism)
* Monsters result from a fragmentation of perception and recombination that disregards natural specificity
* Physical deformity corresponds to real human characteristics; moral monstrosity is a projection of calamities or public/private misfortunes onto the victim
* Stereotypes merge in mythological monsters, creating a unique climate specific to mythology
	+ Heroes have monstrous traits: size, theriomorphism, androgyny, anomalies, insanity, excessive or aberrant sexual behavior, incest, massacres
* Physical and moral monstrosity go together in mythology but should not be conflated with historical victims for understanding the mentality of persecution.


#### Exploring the connection between historical persecutions and mythological victims.

**The Imagination of Guillaume de Machaut vs. Aesthetic Imagination**

**Imagination in Mythology**:
- Refers to Guillaume de Machaut's imagination at its most confused
- The "son of imagination" is referred to, which brings us back to the real victims
- The imagination of the persecutors, not the aesthetician
- Physical and moral monstrosity are heaped together in myths that justify persecution of the infirm
- This difference should not lead to concluding the two types of texts cannot have a common source

**Persecutions vs. Mythology**:
- **Less rational the persecutors' conviction, more formidable it becomes**
- In historical persecutions, the victim is condemned in advance and cannot defend themselves
- Witches are hunted legally, Jews charged with crimes
- However, in mythology, the guilty person is so much a part of their offense that it seems to be a fantastic essence or ontological attribute
- This leads to perceptive scholars failing to disassociate these details and identify the accusatory process

**Distortions in Persecution**:
- Distortions become weaker as we move from myths to historical persecutions in the Western world
- This has allowed us to decipher the latter, using the text of Guillaume de Machaut as a guide
- We must recognize all the stereotypes of persecution and the reality of acts of violence and victims behind themes that seem fantastic

**Myths vs. Historical Persecutions**:
- Mythical illusions persist, even though we are free of them
- We tend to consider necessarily fictional even the most plausible characteristics of mythological heroes
- However, the reality in the case of anti-Semitic massacres should not be doubted just because they are juxtaposed with fables
- The face of the victim shows through the mask in historical persecution texts
- Mythology's mask is still intact, covering the whole face so well that we have no idea it is a mask
- We save our "only eye" for what we call history, not mythology


#### Exploring the sacred in myths through persecution beliefs and scapegoats.

**Mythology and the Sacred**

**The Absence of the Sacred in Historical Persecutions:**
- Medieval and modern persecutors only hate their victims, not worship them
- Difficult to spot sacred elements in supernatural beings as cult objects
- Heroes' adventures may resemble stereotypical crimes of persecutees
- Experts dismiss these incidents as "minor escapades"

**The Nature of the Sacred and Its Presence in Myths:**
- Mythology contains traces of the sacred, not just hate
- Belief in stereotype of accusation is a true belief, shared by many
- Social consensus creates an illusion that victims are guilty
- Collective representation in persecution texts reveals this belief

**Scapegoating as a Collective Representation:**
- Victims are scapegoats for collective frustration and anguish
- Perpetrators are caught up in the "logic" of the representation
- Misconceptions about the term "scapegoat" can lead to misunderstandings

**Mythology as a Form of Collective Representation:**
- Myths contain deeper meanings beyond surface level similarities
- Idealists may argue mythology escapes through transcendental dimension
- But this is not the case due to:
  - Presence of sacred elements in myths (as seen in persecution texts)
  - Ability to recognize degenerated forms of mythological concepts


#### Mythology: The Power of the Scapegoat and Reconciliation in Persecution

**Understanding Scapegoating: Persecution in Mythology vs. Modern Society**

**The Illusion of Persecution**
- People often fail to recognize their own shortcomings
- Scapegoats are frequently discovered by others, not ourselves
- Guillaume de Machaut's "Black Death" narrative: scapegoating was more prevalent in the past than today
  - Less nuanced understanding of causality
  - Stronger belief in sacred power of victim

**Conditions for Strong Belief in Scapegoats**
- Total reconciliation among persecutors necessary
  - Successful polarization of suspicions, tensions, and reprisals
- Order restored or established by interventi on of the scapegoat figure
- Mythological universes exhibit strong belief in scapegoating mechanism
  - Guilty victim restores order through violent or liberating conclusion

**The Enigma of Mythology**
- Perpetual conjunction of guilty victim and restoration/establishment of order
- Transgressor becomes a pillar of society despite initial guilt
- Interpreters struggle to understand this paradox
  - Camouflaged in some myths but present beneath the surface

**Reexamining Our Understanding of Scapegoating**
- Reconciliation between persecutors necessary for scapegoat mechanism's effectiveness
- Unity and causality absorbed by the scapegoat figure
  - Perpetrators see themselves as passive, reactive, and controlled by the scapegoat.


### 4. Violence and Magic

**Chapter Four: Violence and Magic**

**The Sacred in Persecutions**
- Overlooked instances of the sacred in intelligible distortions
- Scapegoat mechanism as origin of various types of distortions

**Medieval Persecutions**
- Jews enjoyed exceptional prestige due to superior medical practice
- Preference for Jewish doctors linked to power to cure and cause sickness
- Survival of primitive form of the sacred

**Doctor's Fear and Authority**
- Doctors held in near-sacred fear due to their authority
- Association with omnipotent manipulator sanctioned by society

**The Scapegoat**
- Scapegoat recognized as unique cause of plague or sickness
- Master of life and death, dispensing cures or causing illness at will

**Historical Context vs Mythology**
- Arbitrary distinction between historical and mythological texts
- Presenting a story in modern setting may overlook remnant of unconscious persecution

**Lopez Case Study**
- Master of life and death, dispensing cures or causing sickness at will
- Historical requirements deprive him of legal protection like accused witches
- Real crimes committed against false background of innocence

**Victims Linked to Medicine and Warfare**
- Same men who denounce witches seek their help
- Persecutors attribute both capacity to do harm and its reverse to victims.


#### Mythology and Persecution: Merging Animals and Humans

**The Merging of Moral and Physical Monstrosities**
- The medieval figure of the old witch is a good example of merging moral and physical monstrosities found in mythology
- Witches were believed to have an affinity with goats and other animals, leading to accusations of bestiality and scapegoating

**The Loss of Differences between Man and Animal**
- The suppression of differences between man and animal reappears in the context of anti-Semitism
- Jews were considered connected to goats and other animals, similar to mythological figures like Jupiter's swan or Pasiphae's bull
- This merging of human and animal is seen as a "crisis" that must be suppressed through scapegoating the Jewish community

**The Scapegoat Mechanism in Mythology**
- The myth of the Dogrib Indians provides an example of this process, where a woman gives birth to children who can shed their animal skins
- This story contains stereotypical elements of victimization and scapegoating, including the woman's criminal bestiality and the community's banishment and punishment of her
- The second stage in mythology involves making the scapegoat sacred, allowing the community to reconcile and rebuild unity around the victim

**Distinguishing Mythological and Historical Texts**
- Interpreters have failed to distinguish between the first and second stages of mythological transfiguration
- Historical texts reflecting the perspective of the persecutors are more limited to the first stage, while myths comprise both stages
- This analysis allows for a logical understanding of the second transfiguration, which has little equivalent in our universe

**Collective Violence and Myth Creation**
- Collective violence is still creating myths in our universe, but its effectiveness is decreasing


#### Analyzing persecution and magic in mythology: ethnological perspectives

**Mythical Transfigurations**

**The Second Mythical Transfiguration**:
- The most fragile of the two mythical transfigurations
- Almost entirely disappeared from modern Western history
- Survives only as a phenomenon of persecution, limited to the first transfiguration
- Belief in persecutors is directly proportional to the decline of this ability to decode

**Decoding Ability**:
- Began with the decomposition of the sacred
- Developed into the ability to read partially decomposed forms
- As our ability grows, we are encouraged to go back to intact myths and decode their meaning

**The Dogrib Myth**:
- Contains elements of violence and persecution
- Interpretation is similar to that of the "false" myth of Oedipus
- Suggests a real victim behind the text, but this may be a mistake

**Magical Thought in Ethnology**:
- Recognizes "magical thought" as a supernatural explanation of causality
- Sees it as a precursor to the scientific principle of causality
- Emphasizes similarities between magical and scientific interpretations

**Witchcraft and Magical Beliefs**:
- Reveal a theory of causation where misfortune is due to witchcraft cooperating with natural forces
- Allows intervention only with witchcraft, as the other causes are recognized but not considered socially relevant
- Seeks a significant cause on the social level: a human victim or scapegoat


#### The scapegoat mechanism in mythology and collective violence.

**The Scapegoat Mechanism: Understanding the Relationship between Magical Thinking, Mythology, and Violence**

**Magical Thought vs. Science**:
- Magic generally lags behind science in terms of understanding
- Not due to ignorance or contempt of determinism, but a more "imperious and uncomplaining demand for it"
- Magical thought is often seen as a defensive response against perceived threats

**The Scapegoat Mechanism**:
- The mechanism behind historical persecutions and mythological narratives
- Involves the identification of a victim, who is then transfigured into a source of power or order
- This process serves three functions:
  - A model for mythology, where it is commemorated as a religious epiphany
  - A model for ritual, which reproduces the actions of the victim
  - A countermodel for the forbidden, emphasizing the need to avoid repeating harmful actions

**The Relationship between Myths and Rituals**:
- The scapegoat mechanism functions on a higher order in mythology than in history
- Detached observers may see only a helpless victim, while participants perceive the victim as possessing extraordinary power
- Primitive rites involve the crowd focusing on and "flinging itself" on the victim, mirroring the story of a formidable god who saved the faithful by sacrificing themselves
- The relationship between myths and rituals is often misunderstood due to the deceptive nature of words and actions


### 5. Teotihuacan

**Teotihuacan Mythology:** Aztec Myth of Sun and Moon Creation
- Myth denies relevance of collective murder for mythology through belief in willing victim sacrifice
- Two gods involved: Tecuciztecatl (pockmarked) and Nanauatzin
- Gods voluntarily offer themselves to secure world's existence, but element of constraint present
- Pockmarked god exhibits weakness before courageous mission
- Distinctive feature of victim determines choice of god for sacrifice?
  - Myth does not reveal this truth
  - Aztec sun-god also god of pestilence (like Greek Apollo)
- Question whether stigmata signifies victim role and collective murder rather than self-sacrifice.

**Interpreting Myths:**
- Structuralists focus on differences, not symmetries between victims
- Free will vs constraint in gods' behavior
  - First god volunteered, but second god not urged
  - Reversals translated into differences and symmetries
- Collective persecution perspective: pockmarked god as potential scapegoat.


#### Aztec Myth: Sacrifice and Scapegoat Mechanism with Fire and Victims

**Aztec Mythology: The Sun Gods and Saint Sebastian**

**Scapegoating during Epidemics:**
- Plague victims often burned for purification
- Fire considered a means of both cure and contagion
- Scapegoat mechanism used to identify victim responsible for epidemic or cure
- Sun-gods seen as sick individuals who are burned to become forces for good
- Celestial bodies, sun, moon, and stars, provide permanent light and must be nourished with victims

**Saint Sebastian:**
- Offered as preferred target for malady
- Coated with arrows, symbolizing sun's rays or pestilence
- Protects against plague by attracting wandering arrows to him
- Plays role of scapegoat, both protected and divine due to tainted state

**Teotihuacan Myth:**
- Lack of difference between day and night as crisis setting
- Preferential signs of victims present: no difference between guilt and innocence
- Two violent deaths produce differentiating decision, resulting in two luminous stars
- Subtle element of constraint in free will of victims suggested
- Four stereotypes of scapegoat mechanism present: crisis, faults/crimes, preferential signs of victim, and collective murder (despite denial)

**Aztec Religion:**
- Gods line up menacingly on two sides, regulate every detail
- Voluntary deaths presented as self-sacrifice but with element of constraint
- Sacrifices essential to maintaining light and order in the world.


#### Mimesis and Sacrifice in Mythology: Unified Gods and Imitative Victims

**Mythology: Aztec Sacrifices and Mimesis**

**Background:**
- Scholars' reluctance to critically examine ethnological societies compared to their own
- Complexity of understanding myths from ancient cultures
- Idea of consenting victims in myths vs. reality

**Aztec Mythology:**
- Sacrifice necessary for world's existence and movement
- Gods require human sacrifice: Tecuciztecatl overcomes fear through imitation (mimesis)
- Future moon-god, driven by hubris, claims to be beyond all models, ultimately unable to follow his own guidance
- Sun-god takes initiative as effective model for others
- Mimetic collaboration of victims with their executioners continues in Middle Ages and modern times

**Impact on Society:**
- Fear not enough explanation for this behavior
- Oedipus joins chorus declaiming his abominable defilement
- Exaggerated self-image presented by some cultures justifies "bloody orgies" (ethnocentrism)
- Importance of understanding historical context without judgment or reversal.

**Aztec Mythology:**

**Sacrifice**:
- Necessary for world's existence and movement
- First victims are not enough, gods must be sacrificed to force sun and moon to move
- Tecuciztecatl overcomes fear through imitation (mimesis) of his companion

**Gods**:
- United in mimesis, controlling the whole scene
- Freedom and constraint bound together

**Modern Parallels:**
- Witches chose their own stake for punishment in sixteenth century
- Heretics called for the just punishment merited by their beliefs
- Stalinism: violent victims confess more than asked, rejoice in punishment

**Mimetic Collaboration**:
- Continues in Middle Ages and modern times
- Fear not enough explanation for this behavior

**Modern Perception:**
- Ethnologists warn against ethnocentric judgments
- Current excesses reverse former arrogant exaggerations but remain problematic
- Importance of understanding historical context without judgment or reversal.


### 6. Ases Curetes and Titans

**Mythological Analysis: Collective Murder in Scandinavian Mythology**

**Background:**
- Discussion of myths depicting collective murder where scene appears fake or insignificant
- Focus on the story of Baldr from Scandinavian mythology and its relationship to other myths

**Baldr's Story**:
1. **Best god with no faults**
2. Fearful dreams of impending death, shared concern among Ases
3. Seek protection against all danger: oaths from animate & inanimate creatures
4. Exception: mistletoe shoot not asked for oath
5. Loki disguises himself as a woman, learns exception from Frigg
6. Gives twig of mistletoe to Baldr's blind brother Hoehr
7. Hoehr strikes and kills Baldr with the sacred plant
8. Final consequence: Baldr perishes despite gods' protection

**Analysis**:
1. Game of Ases seems fake, but ultimately leads to same result as collective murder
2. Loki's treachery cancels out effect of oaths, resulting in Baldr's death
3. Original version may have been different: Baldr victim of classic collective murder
4. Ancestors misunderstood primordial epiphany and interpreted it wrongly as collective murder
5. Loki became unique receptacle for violence, clearing other gods of guilt
6. Reputation of loner, Loki, sacrificed for rehabilitation of all other gods
7. Paradoxical choice of Loki as the only one not participating in lynching.

**Implications**:
- Myths with seemingly insignificant collective murder scenes may hold deeper meanings
- Misunderstanding or misinterpreting primordial epiphanies can lead to misunderstandings about the nature of these myths.


#### Mythology and Collective Murder: Innocent Scapegoats and Protective Violence.

**Myth Analysis: Baldr's Death and Zeus' Birth**

**Baldr's Death**
- **Hoehr**: Person who deals fatal blow to Baldr, also called "handbam" or one who kills by hand.
- **Collective Murder**: Hoehr is most likely the criminal, but the myth takes exceptional measures to prove his innocence.
  - **Blindness**: Hoehr is blind; someone guides his hand to target.
  - **Reassurance**: Believes Baldr is invulnerable, holds light and insignificant object.
  - **Three Denials of Responsibility**: Loki manipulates Hoehr into committing the murder.
- Mythologists often overlook aversion to collective murder in myth analysis.

**Zeus' Birth**
- **Kronos**: Devours all his children, looking for last-born Zeus.
- **Rhea**: Hides Zeus from Kronos with help of Curetes.
  - **Collective Violence Absent**: Curetes clash weapons to drown out baby's crying and deceive Kronos.
- Myth presents protectors as collectively violent when trying to save the infant, creating an illusion of lynching scene.
- Greek solution more elegant and radical than Scandinavian solution in handling collective murder theme without consequence.


#### Mythical transformations: Collective violence disappears, but not reversibly.

**The Scapegoat: Transformation of Myths**

**Religious Thoughts and Objectives**:
- Two religious thoughts pursuing similar objectives at a similar stage in their evolution
- Collective murder is too scandalous to be authentic, reinterpreted by interpreters as corruption of tradition

**The Myth of Zeus and the Curetes**:
- Absence of collective murder seen as speculative, but potentially supported by another myth
- Dionysus' infancy: Titans assassinate, roast, and eat him; Zeus destroys Titans and revives Dionysus
- Significance reversed between Curetes and Titans
- Objects shaken in front of child, harmless but deadly in one myth, deadly but harmless in the other

**Structural Analysis vs. Transformation of Mythology**:
- Structuralism perceives all oppositions as equal, unable to identify significance of collective murder's disappearance
- Magician metaphor: Collective murder disappears and cannot reappear once transformed
- Mythology eliminates collective murder but does not reinvent it

**The Myth of the Titans**:
- Corresponds to a religious vision similar to Zeus, with collective violence declared evil
- Children and naive people experience fear and revulsion when confronted with the myth of the Titans


### 7. The Crimes of the Gods

**The Crimes of the Gods: Plato's Attempt to Eliminate Mythological Violence**

**Mythology's Transformation:**
- Stage 1: Collective violence becomes individual violence (Plato)
- Stage 2: Suppression of individual violence in mythology (Greek and Roman mythology)
- Plato's intention to remove traces of mythological violence

**Plato's Perspective:**
- Objectionable are tales of Kronos and Zeus's misdeeds
- Proposed censorship: access restricted, sacrifice required
- Sacrifice as a counterbalance for contaminating violence

**Impact on Philosophy:**
- Platonic stage leads to rational and philosophical culture
- Mythology condemned as primitive and morally ambiguous
- Desire for differentiation between good and evil in the divine

**Evolution of Mythology:**
- Transformation from collective to individual violence
- Loss of brutal and spectacular collective character
- Perpetuation of stereotypes, including stereotype of violence to which gods are subjected.


#### The role of crimes in ancient gods and their representation in mythology.

**Relationship between Gods and Stereotypical Crimes**

**Background:**
- Ancient mythologies contain gods who commit crimes
- Myths cannot be divided into guilty or innocent gods
- Variety of variations from most atrocious crimes to minor faults with disastrous consequences
- Evolutionary character, revealing the wish to minimize and excuse a fault

**Plato's Perspective:**
- Objected to attributing all typical crimes to the gods
- Opposed poetic treatment that makes crimes appear as minor faults or trivial pranks (Aristotelian notion of "hamartia")
- Seeks revelation of victim mechanism and demystification of representations of persecution

**Impact of Aesthetic Treatment:**
- Minimizes or conceals original scapegoat mechanism
- Baleful dimension of sacred present but reduced to a minimum
- Prolonged effect of scapegoat needed for extreme respect towards traditional texts

**Division of Good and Evil:**
- Inevitable division after different pressures on original mythical collection
- Balance in myths broken, sometimes favoring evil or good, sometimes both directions at once.


#### Divine guilt and the role of scapegoats in mythology: Oedipus, Loki, and Telipinu.

**Scapegoat Divination: The Crimes of the Gods**

**Ambiguous Primitive God**
- Split into hero and monster
- Hero incarnates justified sacrifice
- Monster inherits detestable crimes

**Division at a Late Stage**
- Found in fairy tales, legends
- Justification for community's blame essential

**Dilemma of Moralizing Myths**
1. Retain victim's crimes but claim they were unintentional
2. God or kind of demon appears more guilty as secondary scapegoat
3. Victims introduce actions without intentional wrongdoing
4. Interaction with community based on misunderstanding and misinterpreted communication
5. Crimes seen as real but given a subsidiary reason, such as natural force

**Telipinu, the Hittite God: A Ritual Equivalent of Collective Violence**
1. Divine responsibility increased and diminished by bee sting
2. Collective intervention hides violence
3. No truly bad intentions from any party involved
4. Trickster gods and deceiving gods also scapegoats
5. Helpful because harmful, force of order through disorder

**Questions Remain about God's Intentions**
- Why put helpful figures in difficult situations?
- Why does the god put himself in that position?


#### Myth of Cadmus: Gods, Scapegoats, and Reciprocity

**The Crimes of the Gods**

**Solution to Evil: The Trickster God**
- Third solution to gods who do evil: a god who enjoys doing evil and is amused by it
- Delighted when things go badly, but ultimately helps in reconciliation
- Known for his games and playfulness, which can lead to unintended consequences
- Example of the trickster: Cadmus, ancestor of Theban mythology
  - Kills dragon, sows dragon's teeth, armed warriors spring up
  - Throws a pebble among warriors, who believe each other has provoked them and kill each other

**Scapegoat Mechanism and Reciprocity**
- Relationship between crisis of persecution in human communities and fabled beasts
- Trickster causes social crisis but reveals justification for scapegoat and explanation of its effectiveness
- Evil reciprocity can escalate conflict, with each side believing justice has been done
- Scapegoat mechanism can interrupt this process by channeling group's blind instinct for reprisals into one target

**The Role of the Agent Provocateur (Scapegoat)**
- The agent provocateur is not necessarily the actual cause of the conflict, but becomes the focus of group's belief in a source of disorder
- Recognition of the agent's role as provocateur and reconciliation at their expense can end reciprocal destruction
- Important that everyone is convinced of the reality and identity of the scapegoat, whether real or not.


#### Exploring Collective Murder in Mythology and History: Romulus, Pentheus, and Scapegoats

**The Scapegoat: Cadmus Myth and Collective Murder**

**Cadmus Myth**:
- The warriors' discovery of the truth about what happened prevented further fighting and crisis
- The survivors represent the community, while the dead represent only disorder
- Cadmus represents both the power that created disorder and order
- Cadmus is not a scapegoat explicitly in this myth, but is implicated as a sacred god

**Collective Murder Myths**:
- Found around the world, in various forms
- Difficult to explain solely by "experiences"
- May reveal something about human violence

**Exceptions to Collective Murder Denial**:
- Certain religious commentators, writers (e.g., Freud), and historians have taken these rumors seriously
- Myths of collective murder persist despite denial by modern historians

**Romulus Myth**:
- Romulus, founder of Rome, disappeared during a storm and was later deified
- Some versions suggest he was victim of collective murder by the senators
- This theme is an "antilegend" or effort to demystify the official version

**Diasparagmos (Tearing Apart)**:
- Spontaneous frenzy among crowds, similar to the French riots during religious wars


#### Ancient myths and collective violence: the sacred transformation of murder.

**Collective Violence and the Sacred: The Case of Romulus and Remus Mythology**

**Background:**
- Rioters fight over victim's remains, considering them precious relics
- Close relationship between collective violence and transformation into relics
- Example from racial lynchings in modern times

**The Rumors of Romulus: A Political Plot or Mythological Process?**
- Murderers transform victim into sacred object
- Modern perspective reduces it to a political plot
- Implied relationship between birth of myth and collective violence

**Collective Violence vs. Individually Committed Crime (Remus' Death)**
- Two versions: one with collective murder, another with individual murder
- Collective violence concealed in interpretation of Livy's text
- Romulus kills Remus due to a quarrel over auguries and symbolic boundaries
- Both twins desire the same thing, creating mimetic rivalry and transformation through their own violence.

**Collective Character of the Murder of Remus (Latin: in turba)**
- Essential collective character lost in translation as "in the scuffle"
- Michel Serres' observation on the original Latin text
- Both versions highlight the absence of separation between twins, leading to an indecisive decision from the gods and fierce conflict.


### 8. The Science of Myths

**The Science of Myths**

**Recognizing Violent Events in Religion and Mythology**:
- Religious forms, ideas, and institutions reflect the "warped reflection" of violent events that have had "exceptionally successful" collective repercussions
- These violent acts are commemorated in mythology and force their perpetrators to reenact them
- This memory is transmitted from generation to generation, but the original distortion is lost and buried deeper each time

**The Decoding Process**:
- The process of decoding representations of persecution is "uncontested" and goes unnoticed like God himself
- It has a "hold over us" that is confused with immediate perception
- Recent doctrines have evolved from this single decoding process, which is the only truly lasting one in the Western world

**Scientific Demystification of Myths**:
- The demystification of a Guillaume de Machaut is "universally acceptable" and can be used to cut short endless fuss over textualized mimetic twins
- There is always an outcry against powerful evidence, but this is not intellectually significant
- The historical consequences of such revolt would be catastrophic, but the intellectual consequences would be nil

**Science and Witch-Hunts**:
- The first scientific revolution in the West coincides with the definitive renunciation of witch-hunts
- This is because a determined orientation toward natural causes gradually displaced man's preference for significant causes on the social level, which are susceptible to corrective intervention (i.e., victims)

**The Thesis of Demystification**:
- The author's hypothesis of demystifying myths requires minor adaptations to apply it to mythology
- The day will come when not reading myths in the same way as Guillaume de Machaut will seem as strange as it does today
- This demythification of mythology will no longer be a question of science, just as it is no longer a question for Guillaume de Machaut

**Criticism and Limitations**:
- The author's hypothesis may seem "more serious" than the mundane evidence given, but there are rival theories that seem more scientific
- However, a hypothesis that consists only of risks and uncertainties is equally unscientific.


### 9. The Key Words of the Gospel Passion

**Culture's Predisposition to Conceal Origin in Collective Violence**
- Human culture is predisposed to the permanent concealment of its origins in collective violence
- Understanding this enables us to see the successive stages of a culture and transitions between them as occurring during periods of crisis and widespread violence
- During these times, there is a threat of subversive knowledge spreading, which becomes a victim or quasi-victim of social disorder

**The Christian Bible: A Force of Revelation**
- The Christian Bible (Old and New Testaments) has provided the force of revelation that enables us to decode what we have learned in persecutors' representations of persecution
- It teaches us to decode the whole of religion, leading to a decisive defeat for cultural occultation
- Gospels reject persecution, which weakens the power of illusion and leads to the collapse of institutions derived from these mechanisms

**Quotations from the Old Testament in the Gospels**
- Early Christians took Psalm references seriously; modern critics tend towards rhetorical/strategic interpretation
- Evangelists highlight portions of the Psalms that are seemingly of little intrinsic interest or platitude, emphasizing their significance
- References to the Psalms and Isaiah in the Gospels deny magic causality and stereotyped accusations, refusing blind acceptance by persecuting crowds


#### Biblical rehabilitation of victims contrasted with mythological persecutions and scapegoats.

**Egyptian Mythology and Persecution**
- **Freud**: Egyptian mythology is linked to Judaism, focusing on parricide and incest
- **Passion crowd**: Attachment to stereotyped accusations against Jesus; believes in the cause's excellence but hates without reason
- **Persecutors**: Illusion of victim's guilt (ad causam) not acknowledged
- **Old Testament vs New Testament**: Old Testament provides references for Gospel's account of persecution, brought to fruition by the New Testament

**Victims in Psalms**
- Victims speak out against their persecutors
- Initially rejected as violent and annoying compared to Greek/German mythologies
- Perpetrators are strong in their righteousness, no reason to be troubled

**Biblical Rehabilitation of Victims vs Mythological Accounts**
- Previously, victims were rehabilitated by opposing groups
- In mythology, truth is not allowed to submerge, persecutors' accounts are never compromised
- Gospels deny the causality of magic and repeat the denial at every opportunity
- Even Jesus' disciples are affected by the crowd's power over man

**Keywords of Gospel Passion**
- Denial of causality of magic in Gospels is crucial
- Persecutors' accounts of persecution are not threatened in mythology
- Socrates' death does not involve "true" philosophy, escaping the contagion of scapegoat
- Religious leaders, politicians, and crowd all participate in the action, eventually acting in unison.


#### Exploring the role of crowds in biblical persecutions: unanimous violence and scapegoat mechanism.

**The Scapegoat Mechanism in the Gospels**

**Factors Contributing to Jesus' Crucifixion**:
- Conspiracy of religious leaders: Symbolic but little real importance
- Herod: Plays a smaller role, included for fear of omitting any possible force contributing to Jesus' sentencing
- Pilate: Real power, but the crowd has absolute power once mobilized
- Crowd: Dispersed community with absolute power, forced institutions to disintegrate

**Pilate's Decision**:
- Desire to resist the verdict of the crowd
- Warned by his wife in a dream and committed to saving Jesus
- Joins the mob of persecutors in the end

**The Crowd and the Elite**:
- Not only the "popular masses," but also the elite form part of the crowd
- Gospels cannot be accused of social condescension

**Quotations from the Old Testament (Acts 4:25-28)**:
- Describes the pervasively hostile reception of the forces of the world for the Messiah
- Challenges the notion that the Gospels seek to endow Jesus' death with nobility or provide grandiose orchestration
- Reveals the unanimous violence and failure of the persecutors' representation of persecution

**Significance of Jesus' Death**:
- The coalition remains invincible on the level of brute force but fails to impose its viewpoint
- The weakness of Holy Friday gives way to the strength of Pentecost, and the memory of Jesus' death will be important in a far different way from what the rulers wanted
- The scapegoat mechanism becomes brilliantly apparent and is widely advertised, teaching men to recognize and reject persecutors' accounts of persecution.


#### Exploring the unconscious nature of persecutors in the Gospels' scapegoat mechanism.

**The Scapegoat Mechanism in the Gospels**

**Understanding Persecution:**
- Men will be liberated by demystifying historical mythologies
- Perpetrators' perception of their persecution is crucial for defeat
- Difficulty in recognizing real victims vs. hallucinations
- Unanimity of persecutors exists but often unrecognized

**The Passion Story:**
- Gospels reveal scapegoat mechanism and its unconscious nature
- Perpetrators are not aware of their actions, requiring forgiveness (Luke 23:34)
- Misinterpreting the text leads to hypocrisy and distortion

**The Unconscious:**
- Gospels provide first definition of the unconscious in human history
- Distinction between perception and reality in the Passion story
- Importance of recognizing the mechanism behind scapegoating.


### 10. That Only One Man Should Die

**The Scapegoat Mechanism: Caiaphas' Statement**

**Context**:
- Debate among Jewish leaders regarding Jesus' popularity and potential consequences for the nation
- High Priest Caiaphas proposes sacrificing one man to save the whole nation

**Crisis and Decision-Making**:
- Council unable to come to a consensus, leading to impatient intervention from Caiaphas
- Caiaphas' statement resonates with leaders and galvanizes them into action
- Reassurance that one man's death can prevent greater destruction for the nation

**Symbolism and Mythic Interpretation**:
- Caiaphas, as a political leader, embodies the use of violence to limit potential crisis
- Statement understood on a superficial level as offering social utility in place of transcendent qualities
- Revelation of sacrifice's origins and sacrificial character within the scapegoat mechanism

**Implications and Reactions**:
- Resistance to understanding the true nature of the scapegoat mechanism prevents upheaval
- Experts often neutralize or contain true intuition, hindering progress in understanding the Passion story's revelation.

**Anthropological Perspective**:
- Essential characteristic: crisis provoked in every representation of persecution from the standpoint of the persecutor
- Coalition of worldly powers at origin of all myths, similar to the Passion story.


#### Understanding Scapegoats in Gospels: Innocent Victims and Collective Condemnation.

**Unanimity in Gospels vs. Modern Political Thought**
* **Gospels**: Unanimity not emphasized for submission, but to denounce its mistake as nontruth
* Contrast with modern political thought: divided into constituted authorities and crowd
* Crowd has significant power, even during times of crisis
* Constituted authorities yield to crowd's demands (e.g., Pilate and Herod)
* Both groups criticized by political thought: conservatives consolidate powers, revolutionaries revere violence of the crowd
* Modern political thought cannot dispense with morals but remains political

**The Scapegoat in Gospels**
* Jesus is revealed as a scapegoat: innocent victim, causeless hatred
* Compared to Old Testament prophets who were assassinated or persecuted
* Role as a despised victim inspires the designation (e.g., "stone rejected by builders")
* Ambiguous role may be confused with old-style gods (millstone of scandal)

**Scapegoat in Old Testament and Jonah**
* Scapegoat concept present in Old Testament, referred to as lamb or victim
* Jonah: chosen by lot to be sacrificed during a storm to save the ship
* Sign of Jonah: collective victim.

**Two Types of Texts related to The Scapegoat**
* Some texts do not explicitly mention the scapegoat, requiring interpretation (e.g., Guillaume de Machaut)
* Others provide clearer answers or explanations (e.g., Gospels).


#### Analyzing scapegoat themes in texts: hidden structural principles vs. visible representations.

**The Scapegoat Mechanism in Literature: Guillaume de Machaut's Text vs. The Gospels**

**Scapegoats in Guillaume de Machaut's Text:**
- Explicitly presented as scapegoats by the text itself
  - Controlled by the effect of a hidden structural principle
  - Not acknowledged by the author
- Confusion between this type of text and those acknowledging the scapegoat effect is absurd
  - Important to distinguish between scapegoat in the text vs. scapegoat mechanism

**Scapegoats in Persecution Texts:**
- Written entirely as a function of illusion of victim's false culpability
- Indirect signs of persecution require interpretation
- Structural criticism is essential for understanding these texts
  - Originated from ancient times and continues to be relevant today.

**Scapegoat Mechanism vs. Scapegoat Rites:**
- Frazer's misinterpretation of scapegoat as only referring to rites led him to an uninteresting impasse
- The popular expression "scapegoat" refers not only to ritual but also to the unconscious mechanism for representation and acts of persecution.


#### The structural analysis of scapegoat mythology and religion misunderstood.

**The Scapegoat Concept in Mythology and Religion**

**Frazer's Misunderstanding**:
- Frazer turned to Leviticus for a Hebrew rite related to the scapegoat phenomenon
- Perceived it as an ignorant superstition that religious disbelief and positivism have removed
- Could not see the essential connection between religion and this phenomenon

**The Structural Scapegoat**:
- The concept of a structural principle, absent from the text it structures, is incomprehensible to many scholars
- This fundamental concept is often overlooked in favor of themes and motifs
- The idea of the scapegoat inevitably falls into the rut of theme and motif when considering mythology and religion

**The Myth of Oedipus**:
- Sophocles transformed the myth into a trial, drawing out the accusation from mimetic rivalry
- Insisted that Laius fell at the hands of many murderers, not just one scapegoat
- The author refrains from answering the questions posed, leaving the structural principle of the scapegoat unresolved

**Inconsistency in the Myth**:
- Oedipus cannot be both incestuous son and parricide, and innocent scapegoat at the same time
- Indicates an internal struggle within the tragedy between accepting or rejecting the myth

**Jean-Pierre Vernant's Perspective**:
- Sees the myth as a flat surface covered with themes and motifs, including the scapegoat
- Avoids the term "scapegoat" by calling it "pharmakos", a theme in Greek culture
- But the tragedy cannot fully adhere to or reject the myth, leading to internal contradictions

**Importance of Understanding the Scapegoat Principle**:
- Recognizing the structural principle of the scapegoat is crucial for understanding the persecutor's representation of persecution
- It is a key to demystifying Guillaume de Machaut's work and the broader cultural phenomenon of witchcraft trials.


### 11. The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist

**The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist**

**Originality and Mythology**:
- Christians and anti-Christians alike believe originality lies in creating new schools or fashions, rather than understanding the roots of their beliefs
- The Gospels are not truly original as they discuss the same events as other religions and myths
- Ethnologists have shown that primitive myths resemble the Gospels, particularly in the concept of a collective punishment or scapegoat

**The Passion and John the Baptist's Murder**:
- The Gospel text describes the murder of John the Baptist, which shares similarities with the trial and crucifixion of Jesus
- Differences between the two events are not significant enough to conclude they are from the same source or that one is a replica of the other
- Both events are structured around the concept of mimetic desires leading to mimetic rivalries, resulting in a collective scapegoat effect

**Herod, Herodias, and John the Baptist**:
- Herod was married to his brother's wife, Herodias, who demanded the head of John the Baptist after her daughter danced for the king and his guests
- The Gospel text does not emphasize the legal issue of the marriage, but rather the sibling rivalry between Herod and his brother

**Sibling Rivalry**:
- Siblings are condemned to rivalry by their proximity, fighting over the same heritage, crown, or wife
- The concept of enemy brothers is present in both myths and the Gospel text


#### Mimetic Desire and Brotherly Relationships: Herod, Herodias, and John the Baptist.

**Mimetic Desire and Twin Relationships: Herod and His Brother**

**Background:**
- Question of whether identical desires make people alike or vice versa
- Mythical example of Herod and his brother as symbol and reality of mimetic desire
- Herod had a real historical brother whom he supplanted

**Herod's Desire for Herodias:**
1. **Proposition 1**: Relationship determines twin desires
   - Herod and brother are symbols of each other's desire
   - Historical reality: Herod took his wife, Herodias, from his brother
2. **Prophetic warning against mimetic complications**
   - Inflicted defeat on Herod for dispossessing brother
3. **Mimetic desire in the Old Testament: Moses and the Egyptian**
   - Intervened between enemy brothers but no arbitration possible
4. **Luke's Gospel: A man's request for inheritance division**
   - Jesus declares himself incompetent as judge or arbitrator
5. **Comparison with Exodus: Moses and the Hebrew's challenge**
   - No distinction between legitimate and illegitimate violence
6. **Herodias, Herod, and their desires**
   - Caught between two Herods
   - Desire festers and becomes overwrought due to failure to heed prophetic warning
7. **Herodias' hatred and the cycle of mimetic desire**
   - Attracted by John but rejected, desire becomes destructive
   - Repulsion and attraction lead to increased hatred towards John
8. **The role of John the Baptist as an obstacle**
   - Inflexible, inaccessible, and fascinates Herod and Herodias
9. **Salome's request for John's head**
   - Strange occurrence after Herod's offer
10. **Conclusion:**
    - Mimetic desire leads to a cycle of attraction and repulsion that communicates itself as hatred.


#### Exploring the role of imitation and scandal in desire and mimesis.

**The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist**

**Salome's Desire**:
- Salome has no desire of her own
- Herod offers her everything, so she asks her mother what she should desire
- Her mother's desire becomes Salome's own desire

**Imitation and Mimetic Violence**:
- The process of imitation makes those it possesses more interchangeable and capable of substitution as its intensity increases
- Desire, instead of creating individuals, makes them more easily replaceable
- Salome's imitation of her mother's desire is even more intense than the original

**The Concept of Scandal**:
- Scandal or the stumbling block is a notion that previews the text without being mentioned explicitly
- Scandal attracts and repels at the same time, creating a fascination that draws one to return to it
- Desire incorporates obstacles in its vision of the desirable, becoming increasingly hatful for them

**Salome as a Child Victim of Scandal**:
- Salome is a child victim of scandal, as she models her behavior on her mother's desire
- Herodias uses her own child to circumvent Herod and obtain his consent to the death of the innocent man
- In an effort to protect herself from scandal, the child sinks deeper by making her mother's appalling desire her own


#### Scandal, desire, dancing, mimetic contagion, sacrifice, John the Baptist, Salome, head of the scapegoat, primitive obsession, ritual.

**The Scapegoat: The Power of Scandal and Dance**

**Scandal as a Natural Mechanism of Self-Destruction**:
- Metaphors like the "drowning person with a millstone around his neck" suggest a natural process of self-destruction rather than supernatural intervention.
- By becoming part of the vicious circle of scandal, men forge their own destiny.

**Desire as a Noose**:
- Desire is like a noose that each person ties around their own neck.
- It is tightened at each tug of the scandalized.

**The Physical Equivalent: The Treadmill and Hanging**:
- The physical equivalent, such as the treadmill turned by mules or hanging, is less terrible than the process itself.
- Judas' hanging inflicts the punishment that prolongs his own evil, the scandal to which he is prey, the mimetic jealousy that devours him.

**Scandal and the Dance**:
- Scandal prevents us from enjoying the dance, which allows us to identify with the dancer and escape the scandal.
- The dance exacerbates desire rather than suppressing it.

**The Mechanism of Desire**:
- What prevents us from dancing is the dreadful intertwining of our desires, which keep us tied to the ground.
- The other of desire always seems responsible for this misfortune; we are all like Herodias, obsessed with some John the Baptist.

**The Collective Desire**:
- Dance accelerates the mimetic process, involving all the guests at the banquet in the dance and converging all the desires on the one object.
- The collective "yes" to the beheading should not be interpreted as merely a polite gesture of acquiescence; the guests are all under Salome's spell.

**The Shaman and the Ritual**:
- The dancer can make the lame dance by exorcising the demon that possesses them, enabling them to exchange their weariness and torment for the head of John the Baptist.
- Like a lion-tamer, the master of ritual unleashes monsters that will devour him unless they remain in control through constantly renewed efforts.

**Scandal as the Unobtainable Desire**:
- Scandal is the unobtainable that desire wishes to obtain, the absolutely unavailable that it wants absolutely at its disposition.
- The head of John's severed head becomes a better representation once it is severed from the body, especially when placed on a dish.


#### Analyzing Salome's Dance: Mimesis, Ritual, and Desire in Mark's Gospel

**The Dance of Salome**

**Salome's Desire**:
- Copied from Herodias
- Words belong to Hero­dias
- Only new element is the idea of the dish
- Famous part of the scene in Mark
- Represents decadent artist's scandalous idea

**The Dish and Beheading**:
- Herodias only mentioned "the head"
- Salome takes it literally, focusing on the physical object
- Lack of understanding leads to misinterpretation
- Separating mimesis from desire perpetuates false dichotomies

**Mimesis in Art**:
- Traditionally associated with art
- Narrowly imitative, obsessive
- Denying this leads to insignificant efforts
- Mimesis should be expanded to include desire

**The Dance and its Effects**:
- Mark says "and danced" without describing the dance
- Relationships among characters are key
- Accelerating mimetic rivalries lead to "victimage" mechanism
- Art reproduces this crisis in various forms

**Herod's Banquet and Ritual**:
- Occasion for Salome's request
- Recurring, feast-like nature of the event
- Ritual aspects contribute to the mystery
- Herodias manipulates desires through ritual activities


#### Analyzing ritual as a manifestation of desire's mimetic crisis with scapegoat mechanism.

**The Ritual Dimension of Desire and Mimetism**

**Ritual as Mimetic Replication**:
- Ritual is a mimetic repetition of an original mimetic crisis
- There is no difference between the rite itself and the spontaneous, natural course of the mimetic crisis
- Ritual does not provide any real solution, it merely recopies the resolution that occurred spontaneously
- Ritual activity fosters and channels mimetic desire towards designated victims

**Authentic Rites vs. Authentic Disorder**:
- Authentic rites are different from authentic disorder due to the unanimous opposition to the victim that is perpetuated under the aegis of a victim mythically restored and made sacred
- Rite is the reenactment of mimetic crises in a spirit of voluntary religious and social collaboration, achieving agreement at the victim's expense
- In diachronic evolution, disorders that precede and necessitate sacrifice are attenuated, while festive and convivial aspects increase in importance

**Perversion of Ritual Function**:
- Herodias mobilizes the ritual forces and directs them knowingly towards the victim of her hate
- By perverting the rite, she restores mimesis to its former virulence and redirects sacrifice back to its murderous origins
- Salome's relationship with her mother and excessive offer are reminiscent of fairy-tales with an unhappy ending
- Herod's limited powers depend on Roman goodwill, and the exorbitant offer may have been influenced by other texts or folktales

**Significance of Exorbitant Offer**:
- The donor is in an inferior position, as if dispossessing themselves and giving everything to the receiver
- Possession in this context refers to a trance-like state where the perspective becomes inverted, with only the other being at home
- The language of the offer is both that of an oath and incantatory prayer, expressing the strongest desire to be possessed.


#### Mimetic desire and sacrifice in Herod's offering and Salome's demand.

**The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist**

**Exorbitant Offers and Mimetic Desire**:
- Herod makes an excessive offer to ask for anything he wants, including half his kingdom
- The object or person attached to the offer is not explicitly mentioned, as it may be perceived as diminishing the value of the offer
- This object becomes the focus of mimetic desire, which leads to its demand being made in preference to all else

**Tragedy and Sacrifice**:
- Tragic dramas closely resemble daily life, as they involve a hard sacrifice that cannot be measured against worldly things
- The value lies not in the true price but in the desires already focused on the object
- The demand represents the greatest sacrifice for the one who must give up a cherished being
- The one making the demand is akin to a divine figure, a "Salome"
- This essential aspect of the story is often obscured by modern authors as they focus on consumerism rather than sacrifice

**Mimeticism and Collective Desire**:
- Mimetic desire leads to collective mimeticism, which can result in destruction
- The pleasure experienced during dance is akin to being possessed by the "genius" of the model, leading to loss of self-awareness
- This creates an appetite for sacrifice, requiring appeasement and a scapegoat to destroy
- Sacrificial mimeticism reigns supreme at this moment of greatest intensity

**The King's Dilemma**:
- Herod is deeply distressed but unable to break his oaths, leading him to ultimately acquiesce to Salome's demand
- His earlier desire to protect John's life is overridden by the more murderous collective desire
- The guests, representing elite society, intimidate Herod and control his actions


#### Mimetic desire and the scapegoat's unanimous selection in religious institutions.

**The Enormous Potential of Mimetic Influence**

**Mark's Description of the Passion Story**:
- Enumerates all forces of this world that form a coalition against the Messiah
- Describes how the crowd and rulers join and meld, with the crowd providing the mimetic energy necessary for decision
- Mark describes this in detail not for pleasure but to clarify the decision to remove the prophet's head

**The Crowd's Reaction**:
- The guests react identically at the supreme stage of mimetic crisis
- They provide the type of crowd that alone can intervene decisively
- When the crowd is unanimously murderous, the decision always rests with it

**Herod and Pilate**:
- Herod, like Pilate, yields to this pressure and loses himself in the crowd
- There is no need to look for a psychology of the principal characters

**The Prophet's Death**:
- The prophet dies because he has revealed the truth of desire to people who do not want to listen
- This is one more, and the most ironic, preferential sign for the selection of a victim

**Mimetic Crisis and Unanimous Desire**:
- Mimeticism inevitably becomes unanimous, causing universal agitation or calm
- The convergence on John's head is only a mimetic illusion, but its unanimous character achieves real calm

**Religious Force of the Beheading**:
- The passage presented as a flashback shows that Herod chose to believe John had been resurrected
- Persecutors cannot believe in the definitive death of their victims, and see their resurrection/consecration as a phenomenon of persecution


### 12. Peters Denial

**Peter's Denial**

**The Prophet Zechariah's Prophecy**:
- Jesus quotes Zechariah to describe the effect of his Passion: "I shall strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered" (Zech. 13:7; Mark 14:27)
- The dispersal takes place immediately after Jesus' arrest

**Peter's Behavior**:
- Peter is the only disciple who does not run away, following the procession to the High Priest's courtyard
- He enters the courtyard through the auspices of an "other disciple" (likely John)
- Peter joins the guards and is warming himself by the fire, as the servants and officers do

**Peter's Denials**:
- A maidservant asks Peter if he was with Jesus, and he denies it
- Another servant girl, then a group of bystanders, also ask Peter about his association with Jesus
- Peter responds defensively, cursing himself and swearing that he does not know the man they speak of
- As the cock crows twice, Peter recalls Jesus' prediction of his three denials and bursts into tears

**Interpretation**:
- **The being with**: The existentialist concept of "being with" another person is significant here. Peter, as part of the group around the fire, unconsciously seeks to be in a "being with" relationship with them, even though he has lost his connection to Jesus.
- **Fire as a symbol**: The fire represents a place for communion and communication, where new ways of being with others become possible. It is no coincidence that all four Gospels mention the fire in relation to Peter's denial.


#### Mimetic Denial: Unmasking Hidden Identities through Language and Accents

**Interpretation of Mark's Gospel: Denial Scene**

**Peter's Behavior**
- Initially hesitates to leave when recognized as a disciple
- Does not show fear, instead waits for events to unfold
- Speaks forcefully during exchange with servant girl and crowd
- Denies knowing Jesus three times

**Servant Girl's Role**
- Repeats accusation twice to unleash group mimeticism
- Acts as a leader figure, inspiring imitation from bystanders
- Sets herself up as a model for others to follow

**Mimetic Rivalry and Identity**
- Peter tries to integrate himself through accurate imitation of his interlocutors
- Inability to perfectly mimic accent reveals true identity
- Language is an essential indicator of one's being with or belonging

**Scapegoat and Denial**
- Peter's denial not aimed at convincing anyone but severing bonds with Jesus
- Violent gestures and curses directed towards self, not interlocutors.


#### Mimetic Psychology and Peter's Denial in the Gospels

**The Denial of Peter as a Form of Persecution**
* Peter denies Jesus to conform to societal pressures
* Fear and shame drive his denial
* Intense imagination and servile imitation required for denial
* Structural equivalence between persecution and denial
* Matthew's words on anger, name-calling, and hellfire reflect the importance of this structural identity
* Denial is an episode in the Passion, a form of mimeticism

**Peter's Denial as Part of a Larger Narrative**
* Peter follows in the footsteps of Pilate and Herod
* Ancient gesture of sacrifices and witch-hunting present in denial
* Deserters demonstrate sincerity through blame
* Anthropological dimension: oaths, curses, and conjuration

**Preparation for Peter's Denial**
* First announcement of Passion: Peter misunderstands Jesus as miracle worker or political chief
* Ideology of success dominates the disciples' faith
* Reprimand from Jesus: "Get behind me, Satan"
* Second announcement of Passion: Peter understands the impending suffering and vows unwavering faith.


#### An analysis of Peter's betrayal and mimetic desire in the Gospel of Matthew.

**Mimetic Desire and the Denial of Jesus**

**Jesus' Observation**:
- Peter and the disciples will deny Jesus after his arrest
- Their mimetic desire drives their reactions, which Jesus can predict

**Peter's Reactions**:
- Initially claimed he would never deny Jesus
- But later denies Jesus three times
- Felt he was the most authentic emulator of Jesus
- Rivalry with other disciples leads to false zeal for the Passion

**The Denial as a "Miracle"**:
- The precision of Jesus' prophecy seems miraculous
- But may reflect a lack of understanding of mimetic desire
- Details like the reference to the cock add to this sense of miraculousness
- Translation differences suggest an original misunderstanding

**Implications**:
- The authors of the Gospels may not have fully understood mimetic desire
- This leads to a transformation of rational predictions into "miracles"


#### An analysis of the role of miracles in the Gospels, focusing on Peter's denial scene.

**Understanding Peter's Denial Scene in the Gospels**

**Background:**
- Writer acknowledges difficulty understanding continuity between apparent discontinuities in Peter's conduct during denial scene
- Perceives importance of concept of scandal but cannot master its application
- Unclear role of cock, which combines with lack of clarity to create a supernatural explanation: the miracle of the cock

**Inadequacy of Writers**:
- Lack clear understanding of rationality behind denial scene and prophecy
- Substitute irrational interpretation for rational one we extract today
- Inability to understand fully due to mimeticism, same as disciples in Jesus' time

**Mimetic Exacerbation and Scandal**:
- Mythical crystallization around the cock derived from mimetic exacerbation
- Transcribers too absorbed in model reproduce details with admirable accuracy but subject to occasional mythological lapses
- Scandal: crucial concept for mimetic reading, often disorganized and contaminated with miracles due to authors' lack of control

**Importance of Scandal**:
- Reorganizing sentences to understand value and coherence of scandal in Gospels
- Irreducible supernatural dimension exists but does not negate means of comprehension
- Miracle defined as unintelligible, while something becoming intelligible is a greater miracle.


### 13. The Demons of Gerasa

**The Demons of Gerasa**

**Background:**
- The Gospels reveal human relationships that are incomprehensible and fundamentally irrational
- Mimetism is the original source of all man's troubles, desires, and rivalries
- Scapegoats are the spontaneous agents of reconciliation

**Mythological and Religious Beginnings:**
- Mythology conceals collective murders and minimizes or eliminates stereotypes of persecution
- The Gospels expose these dynamics with an unequaled severity and strength

**Victim's Guilt and the Passion:**
- No common ground between what happens in the Gospels and mythologies
- The Passion reveals the scapegoat mechanism, i.e., that which should remain invisible if the forces are to maintain themselves
- The Gospels set in motion the only textual mechanism that can put an end to humanity's imprisonment in the system of mythological representation based on false transcendence

**Satan and Demonic Forces:**
- Satan, the false transcendence of violence
- Demonic forces are invoked when disorder predominates
- Transcendence appears in multiple and fragmented form, losing its strength and dissolving into pure mimetic disorder

**Miracles in the Gospels:**
- Mark is most fond of miracles and presents them in a manner contrary to modern sensibility
- Gerasa: A man with an unclean spirit comes out from the tombs towards Jesus
- The man could not be secured by anyone, even with chains, as he would break free and gash himself with stones

**Analysis:**
- Focus on Mark's version of the miraculous cure in Gerasa
- References to Luke and Matthew for interesting variants.


#### Exorcism, possessed man's cyclical crisis, autolapidation, Gerasenes' conflicting desires, hidden desires revealed.

**Demonic Possession in Gerasa (Mark 5:1-17)**

**The Possessed Man**:
- Lived among tombs for long periods
- Wandered in the mountains and tombs
- Unclean spirit begged to enter pigs, causing them to charge into the lake and drown
- Periodically returned to city during remissions
- Violent attempts by community to restrain him were unsuccessful

**The Community's Response**:
- Attempted to restrain the possessed man with chains and fetters
- Wanted to prevent his departure from the city
- Feared the effects of his possession on their society
- Became increasingly violent in their attempts to restrain him
- Experienced real suffering as they could not effectively cure him

**Symbolic Significance**:
- The possessed man's behavior can be described as **autolapidation** - wounding himself with stones
- This may represent his fear of being stoned by the community or a phantasm of such persecution
- The community's repeated attempts to restrain him reveal their hidden desires and the need for a scapegoat


#### Mimetic Relationships in Biblical Demon Possession Narratives: Mimetic Doubles and Scandal.

**The Demons of Gerasa**

**Background:**
- Possessed man brings about his own expulsion and punishment through violent actions
- Gerasenes respond with mitigated violence towards him, creating a cycle of reciprocal aggression
- Symmetry between victim and persecutors to maintain balance in the community

**Mimetic Doubles**:
- Individuals possess each other reciprocally, becoming each other's models and obstacles
- Possession is a result of aggravated mimeticism

**Matthew's Account**:
- Differences from Mark and Luke's texts:
  - Substitution of two identical possessed beings for one demoniac in Mark and Luke
  - Explanatory twist given to retained themes
- Demonic possession is seen as a function of mimeticism and scandal

**Scandal**:
- Contagious nature leads to individuals becoming each other's models and obstacles
- Every reference to a barred way or insurmountable obstacle alludes to the concomitant system of scandal

**Analysis of Miracle**:
- Matthew attempts to return to source of evil by exteriorizing the demon in real mimetic relationship between two individuals
- Introduces duality at beginning but struggles with introducing multiplicity for the miracle's unfolding
- Eliminates key sentence "My name is Legion; for there are many of us" from Mark's text, losing justification for drowning of swine.


#### Analyzing the fearful reaction of Gerasene society towards Jesus' healing of a demon-possessed man and its implications for community dynamics.

**Mark's Strokes of Genius: The Demon-Possessed Man and the Crowds**

**Background:**
- Mark's use of singular and plural in same sentence may seem clumsy but reflects historical context
- The demoniac's healing portrayed as single combat between Jesus and demons, but crowds play important role before and after event

**Galileans vs. Gerasenes:**
- Galileans not afraid of miracles, crowd gathers for healing or spectacle
- Gerasenes afraid of Jesus, want him to depart
- Differences in reactions highlight plurality and crowd dynamics

**Attachment of Demons and Gerasenes:**
- Demons need human host but can't survive without one
- Reciprocal bond between demons and Gerasenes
- Ritual vs. cyclical pathology: degeneration of ritual, relationships of mimetic doubles

**Societal Structure:**
- Gera­sene society still somewhat structured despite disintegration
- Differences within the system (city vs. country) manifested by calm negative reaction to Jesus' therapeutic success

**Jesus' Healing Methods:**
- Shamanistic practices: making impure spirit name itself, acquiring power over it
- Nothing extraordinary in what Jesus did, but fear from Gerasenes indicates deeper significance

**Impact on Crowds:**
- Fear not due to rhetorical exaggeration but real threat posed by demons' departure and potential return.


#### Collective execution methods in religious texts: stoning and falling from cliffs

**The Demons of Gerasa: Collective Executions in Ancient Societies**

**The Theme of the Cliff**
- Pigs fell from a cliff into a lake: Mark, Luke, and Matthew's Gospels
- Necessitated by realistic economy and collective, ritual significance
- Functional reason: definitive disappearance of the herd
- Collective participation in execution with no physical contact
- Resembles ancient practices like stoning and falling from a high cliff

**Collective Executions: A Ritualistic Method of Capital Punishment**
- Prevalent among ancient and primitive societies
- Eliminates the need for individual revenge
- Powerful effect on reconciliation within communities
- Originated spontaneously in human societies
- Primitive traditions should be taken seriously, but not necessarily historically accurate

**The Scapegoat: A Sacred Victim and Great Legislator**
- Moses as an example of scapegoat-legislator
- Collective violence prefigures unanimous forms of execution
- Scapegoat's murder imitated in ritual for reconciliation

**Associating Stoning and Cliff Top Execution with the Text**
- Context invites association between two forms of execution
- Frequent appearances in Gospels and Acts: adulterous woman, Stephen, Jesus' attempted pushing off a cliff.


#### Exploring the significance of collective possession and destruction in religious texts.

**Understanding the Miracle of Gerasa**

**Background:**
- Luke and other evangelists considered falling from a cliff-top and stoning as equivalents of the Crucifixion
- Collective murder has significance revealed in Jesus' Passion, not location

**Geographic Inaccuracy in Gospels:**
- Critics overlooked why Nazareth has an incorrect topography in the Gospels
- Focus on diverse forms of collective death, not geographical accuracy

**Miracle of Gerasa:**
- Demons reverse normal relationships by plunging over the cliff instead of staying on top
- Drowning of swine has definitive character, indicating a difference in nature from usual healings

**Implications:**
- Healers' manipulations do not compromise society's balance
- Demonic forces are linked to human desires and relationships

**Characteristics of Demons:**
- Frantic and demonic desires lead to enslavement, despite awareness of their laws
- Demonology in Gospels highlights mimetic disincarnation

**Symbolism in Literature:**
- Dostoyevsky's novel "The Demons" borrows themes from Gerasa miracle
- Negotiation with Jesus by demons is a vehicle for deeper meanings

**Fate of Demons:**
- Panic and disintegration occur when demons confront Jesus
- Final perdition: drowning, expulsion from their own country.

**Social Context:**
- Gerasenes fear loss of balance due to possessed citizen's role in community
- Frantic mimeticism at the heart of possession.


### 14. Satan Divided against Himself

**Textual Analysis of Jesus as a Healer and the Expulsion of Demons**

**The Gospels' Perspective**:
- The Gospels present Jesus as a healer among healers, but also differentiate him from the Messiah.
- They use demonological language to describe the miraculous cures and expulsion of demons.

**Jesus' Use of Demonology and Expulsion Language**:
- In a debate with religious elite (Pharisees or scribes), Jesus uses demonological and expulsion language.
- He argues that every kingdom divided against itself will not stand, including Satan casting out Satan.
- He challenges his critics to explain how they cast out demons if it is through Beelzebul (Satan).
- Jesus claims to cast out demons by the Spirit of God, implying a different method than his opponents.

**Competing Narratives**:
- Each side claims to act on behalf of God, but through different means: either Satan or the Spirit of God.
- The passage is a caricature of violent competition between the two methods.

**The Scapegoat and Strong Men**:
- The devil is presented as the legitimate "houseowner" or original occupant, while God is stronger.
- However, Jesus does not view himself as just another "strong man," but rather reveals the incoherence of the system.
- The passage may be an indirect discourse (parable) that exposes the impending end of the violent system and the need for a different understanding.


#### Satan's self-destructive power through violence in human societies

**Understanding the Kingdom of Satan: A Closer Look at Jesus' Teachings**

**The Principle of Violence and Divided Communities**
- **Division within societies**: Every kingdom, city, house divided against itself is heading for ruin (Matthew 13:24-30)
- Reversing the order of sentences reveals a deeper meaning: All human communities are based on the principle of internal division and violence
- The repetition of "every" emphasizes the intention to include all forms of community, from smallest to largest

**The Concept of Divine Violence and Satan's Role**
- Jesus speaks as if the satanic principle has used up its force for order
- The text suggests that God has nothing to do with the force of expulsion (Satan)
- Divine expulsion only exists in the representation of persecution from the persecutor's standpoint
- The force of expulsion always originates in Satan, not God
- The men are divided by their mimeticism and continue to cast each other out until total extinction

**The Significance of Order and Disorder**
- Mimetic violence is the source of both order and disorder
- The text may be grossly polemic, unconsciously mimetic, and dualistic
- Satan has never ceased expelling Satan, and there's no reason to believe he will in the future
- The revelation of the scapegoat mechanism renders it useless, as truth shines into dark places.

**Key Takeaways:**
- All human societies are based on the principle of internal division and violence (Satan)
- God has no role in the force of expulsion; it originates from Satan
- The revelation of scapegoat mechanism is significant as it renders it useless for saving men.


#### The Kingdom of God: Division, Expulsion, and Satan's Revealed Ambiguity.

**The Kingdom of God vs. The Kingdom of Satan**

**God's Nature**:
- God is not violent
- True God has nothing to do with violence
- Speaks directly to us, not through intermediaries
- Sends us the Son who is one with Him

**The Kingdom of God**:
- Arrives suddenly, like a bolt of lightning
- Not based on expulsion or internal division
- Reveals the mystery of expulsion, the secret behind Satan's power
- Brings war to the divided world of Satan because it brings peace
- Does not represent an unmitigated blessing for men

**The Kingdom of Satan**:
- Represents a hard task in history, not an eternal green pasture
- People are honest and sympathetic compared to the consumer society
- Demonologic perspective persists but is subverted

**Expulsion vs. Reconciliation**:
- Jesus brings war to the divided world of Satan because He brings peace
- People do not or pretend not to understand this
- The text conveys the power of satanic mimesis and its loss of regulation
- Those who see the truth are liberated from the persecution mentality

**The Scapegoat Mechanism**:
- Double expulsion: one within the system, one external to it
- Divine power does not expel anyone, but unleashes the forces of Satan
- The fundamental ambiguity of Satan makes divine action appear superficially ambiguous


#### Jesus' teachings on demons and mimesis: understanding scandal and expulsion in the Gospels

**Understanding Scandal and Mimesis in the Gospels**

**Background:**
- Jesus' teachings on scandal (skandalon) and demonology
- Mark and Matthew's warnings about parables and their literal interpretation
- The importance of understanding both languages: skandalon and demonic

**Parables as Metaphors for Persecution**
1. Parabolic dimension: a way out of difficult situations
2. Prevention of violence towards the speaker
3. Not always aimed at converting listeners, but revealing their misunderstandings (Matt 13:10-14)
4. Contradictory language in texts about expulsion and demons
5. Jesus' preference for skandalon over demonic language
6. Peter as an obstacle (Satan) to Jesus' mission
7. The role of Peter in revealing the divine mission's worldly under­ taking
8. Correspondence between Gospels' demonology and mimetic relationships
9. Superiority of the Gospels over contemporary interpretations due to:
  a. Mimetic concept
  b. Combination of mimesis with demonology (Gerasa)
10. Demonological vision recognizes the force of desires, hatred, envy, and jealousy among men.

**Parables as Metaphors for Persecution (Continued)**
11. Parable of Peter's denial: Jesus sees Peter as an obstacle to his mission
12. Satan (Peter) plays the role of suppositus, model-obstacle in mimetic desire
13. Great writers resort to demonology for understanding human relationships
14. Recognizing the existence of demons acknowledges the force of desires and emotions among men.


### 15. History and the Paraclete

**History and the Paraclete**

**The Persecution of Christians**:
- Gospels depict phenomena of collective persecution that are discredited or condemned
- Transmission of truth about martyrs as innocent people persecuted by the authorities
- Stereotypes of persecution present, such as accusations of infanticide and incest

**The Sacralization of the Martyr**:
- Canonization vs. sacredness: Socrates, Antigone, and others were rehabilitated but not sacralized
- The martyr's sacralization fails to take place even under favorable conditions
- Traces of primitive quality of the sacred in the glorification of martyrs and medieval saints
- Mechanisms of violence and the sacred part of the fascination exerted by martyrs
- Virtue in blood spilled renewed through new blood

**The Theological Aspects of Christianity**:
- Sacrificial traces: Christians dwell primarily on sacrificial aspects, linking them to social efficacy
- The Epistle to the Hebrews defines death of Christ as perfect and definitive sacrifice, making other sacrifices outmoded
- Failure to uncover the singularity of Christianity's Passion, but prevents return to primitive tradition of sacrifice

**The Scapegoat Mechanism**:
- The failure of mythological genesis in the case of the martyrs allows historians to understand representations of persecution rationally
- No direct proof of involvement of scapegoat mechanism, as it no longer capable of producing true myth


#### Persecution and martyrdom in religious contexts: critique and interpretation of biblical references.

**Demystification of Persecution**
- Critique of representations of persecution must address historical context
- Rehabilitation of martyrs may be viewed as partisan, but rooted in community of belief between victims and defenders
- Christianity's own acts of violence reflect same blindness as its persecutors
- Revolution against allowing beliefs to impose their perspective on others
- Demystification of medieval persecutions took centuries; contemporary persecutions discredited quickly
- Even if a totalitarian system controlled the planet, it would not succeed in making its own myth prevail
- Modern use of terms like "scapegoat" lacks original biblical significance
- Gospels reveal mythology and ethical change through parables (Matthew 25:31-46)

**Language and Meaning**
- Latin's persecui has no connotation of injustice; means to prosecute before a court
- Christian apologists responsible for modern implications of persecutio and martyr
- In Greek, martyr means witness
- Identification with innocent victims comes from putting them in Christ's place

**Universal Diffusion of Gospel Revelation**
- Gospel text speaks to violent people using language of violence but holds universal significance
- Attitude towards victims determines relationship with revelation's exigencies
- Foresees both superficial attachment and indifferent or ill-tempered rejection of the Gospel in different universes.


#### Understanding the Gospel: The Paraclete and Overcoming Violent Religion

**Persecution and Christianity**
- Many still hold a modernist, traditional view of Christianity as persecuting
- This vision is based on two types of ideas:
    - **Christianity triumphed at the state level and began to cloak its authority over persecutions**
    - **Modern Western world idolized science and progress**, believing in a myth of perpetual modern superiority

**The Scientific Spirit and Persecution**
- The scientific spirit is a byproduct of the Gospel text, not the reason for the absence of witch-hunts
- Modern scholars discover traces of magic in classical forms of rationalism and science
- Decoding mythology reveals the role of scapegoats in every culture

**The Paraclete Texts and the Return of the Gospel**
- The Paraclete texts enlighten the process of understanding the Gospel revelation as a critique of violent religion
- Jesus' justification in history and authentication are one with the annulment of Satan
- The return to the Father signifies victory over violence and crossing the abyss separating mankind from the Father

**Conclusion**
- The perpetual circle of violence and the sacred still leads to persecution, but the scientific spirit has revealed that this is not how things come to pass
- By maintaining the word of the Father against violence until the end, Jesus has crossed the abyss separating mankind from the Father.


#### History and the role of the Paraclete: Revealing truth in the struggle against persecution and sacred violence.

**Paraclete and History**
* Spirit works in history to reveal Jesus as divinity without violence
* Satan discredited through historical process of disintegrating worldly gods of violence
* Paraclete, or advocate, defends innocent victims and dissipates mythology fog

**Background**
* Jerome hesitated translating parakleitos due to its relevance
* Common name translation: Paracletus
* Unintelligibility of text not due to inaccessible meaning but interpreters' lack of understanding

**Paraclete as Advocate**
* Definition: universal advocate, chief defender of innocent victims
* Destroyer of representations of persecution
* Reveals victims' innocence and justifies Christ

**Jerome's Translation Dilemma**
* Taken aback by the term's relevance
* Opted for transliteration, Paracletus
* Followed in modern languages

**Significance of Paraclete**
* Unintelligence of interpreters perpetuates world's lack of belief in Jesus as divinity
* Problematic nature of martyr trials and transcendental vs. immanent perspectives
* Gospels proclaim martyrs as witnesses to unity restoration despite persecutions

**Paraclete's Role in History**
* Defends innocent victims against accusations (representations of persecution)
* Discredits Satan by showing his true nature as accuser and deceiver.
