# Occult Memetics Reality Manipulation Warwick Tarl (2016)

> "Occult Memetics" is more than a description of the concept of information transfer. It is a brief hand guide to constructing and using propaganda in spiritual forms, and to manipulating reality. Those who understand the concepts within this work, should they choose to apply them, can potentially change the views of others without even a single spoken utterance. It delves well beyond merely propaganda itself into the nature of reality and its core form. - [Occult Memetics Reality Manipulation Warwick Tarl](https://www.amazon.com/Occult-Memetics-Manipulation-Tarl-Warwick/dp/153977595X?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

### FOREWORD

**Memetics and Occultism: Reality Manipulation**

**Introduction:**
- Memetics: secular interest but overlap with spiritual realm
- Alchemy as predecessor to chemistry
- Modern occult topics need not be veiled anymore
- Memetics is real, occultism is real

**Understanding Memetics:**
- Information transference and synthesis in the mind
- Manipulating this tendency for memetic effect
- Social and political change through memetics
- Previous generations practiced it without quantification

**The Concept of Memetics:**
- Hidden in plain sight
- Known to mesmerists, rhetoric experts, philosophers (not widely understood)
- Unquantified until modern times

**Memetics and Occultism:**
- Social and political change through memetic effects
- Overlaps with social, political, and strictly occult manners
- Important manner of information transference and synthesis.


### MEMETICS IS THE SPREAD OF IDEAS

**Memetics**
- Concept proposed by Richard Dawkins
- Unit representative of small portion of human culture
- Spreads, mutates, drives cultural evolution

**Types of Memes**
- Modern sense: images, often humorous and viral on the internet
- Can take on greater importance beyond internet subculture

**Memetic Occultism**
- Deliberate use of memetics in mundane, secular sense
- Manipulation of communication to cause reflective change

**Examples of Memetic Manipulation**
- Propaganda: good, bad, or ugly
- Newspeak: language used to control thought process
- Historical examples: shaping of reality by others
  - Adolf Hitler's manipulation of the Germanic people into believing they were destined for European domination and a thousand year reign.


### REALITY AS WE PERCEIVE IT IS MANIPULATED CONSTANTLY

**The Perception of Reality**

**Reality as Manipulated**:
- The world we see around us is a result of observable things and our own biases
- Our perception of reality is constantly updated like an arcane computer with new opinions and awareness
- Human beings have lost their collective racial memory through interbreeding but gained a greater understanding of philosophy, good and ill, technology

**Propaganda**:
- Propaganda can have noble purposes behind it, even if the term has negative connotations
- Propaganda was used for noble goals by people who believed in communism's liberating potential
- The author has used propaganda against groups with nefarious purposes, such as the "Desteni" cult and ICQchat, using memetics to cause their downfall without simplistic subtitled cartoons.

**Memetics**:
- Memetics was in play in both cases where the author used propaganda, but simplistic subtitled cartoons were not utilized.


### SONIC AND SPOKEN METHODOLOGY

**Sonic and Spoken Methodology**

**Sonic Occultism**:
- Describes traditional modes of speech and music as spiritual tools
- Discusses the use of memetics, sound, gesture, and symbolism in spreading ideas
- Emphasizes the impact of sound (e.g., movies, music) on shaping perceptions

**Defining Magic**:
- Magic is the "science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will"
- Defined as practices not yet quantified and accepted by modern society
- Can be seen in alchemy, which was a chemical art overlapped with spiritual terms

**Sonic Magick and Memetics**:
- The author uses sound for ritualistic purposes, video for the secular
- Memes operate on a biological principle, spreading like infectious diseases
- Memetic life forms replicate and mutate, with potential deleterious or benevolent outcomes


### TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THE SOURCE OF MEMETICS BUT IT IS AN AGENT OF THE SAME

**Communication Epochs and Memetics:**

**Memetics**:
- Exists as a unit of culture since ancient times
- Dawn of a new era with modern technology and the internet

**Epochs of Communication:**
1. **Written Language (3000 BC)**: First permanent form of recording ideas
2. **Literary Education (859 AD)**: Mass education to maximize use of written language
3. **Printing Press (1440s)**: Increased production and accuracy in literary communication
4. **Early Industrial Era (1830s)**: Rise of telegraph for distance communication
5. **Radio (1894)**: Broadcasting sound over airwaves
6. **Television (1928)**: Visual broadcasting through television
7. **Internet (1991)**: Centralized repository for human thought
8. **Social Media (2006)**: Decentralized mass mobilization and instant transference of ideas

**Impact on Memetics:**
- Each epoch revolutionized communication, making it more efficient and accessible
- Modern "social media" represents a new sub-epoch with decentralized mass mobilization.


### SOME IDEAS ARE LITERALLY VIRUSES

**Ideas as Viruses**
* Some ideas become viral, spreading rapidly like a virus
* Anti-ideas also emerge
* Examples: black-faxing meme, "Dolan" or "Uncle Dolan" concept
* Originally humorless, later became repository for lunacy and socially unacceptable content

**Impact on Society**
* Memetics allows spread of taboo, forbidden information
* Interacts with political climate
* Early 2000s: anti-homosexuality, pacifism, antireligion were unacceptable
* Now: anti-homosexuality, jingoism, theism are new bogeymen
* Memetic propagandists can change cultures over time

**The Role of Communication Technology**
* Internet has become more instant and decentralized
* Social media is the current means of communication, but will be replaced in future
* Number of ideas and concepts being generated increases over time
* Competing ideas replicate indistinguishable from influenza.


### MASS MANIPULATION

**Mass Manipulation**

**Government Propaganda**:
- Governments try to control minds of population through subtle means
- Difficult for them to spread messages in competitive decentralized communication environment
- Resort to censoring information on large centralized websites
- Present propaganda as organically composed by "average people" using sock puppet accounts

**Propaganda Effectiveness**:
- Propaganda largely ineffective on regular basis
- Only effective when entities engage in large-scale memetic assaults with malicious motives

**Cold War Analogy**:
- Political entities competing for hearts and minds of globalized internet population
- Globalism in physical world doesn't work, but effective on the internet

**Memetics Replication**:
- Randomness in human reaction to memetics is not true randomness
- Replication of memes depends on various cultural factors

**Advice for Conscious Use of Memetics**:
- Study basic logic
- Understand how information is searched and found on the internet through tagging.


### THE OCCULT HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT

**Occult Hidden in Plain Sight**

**Overview**:
- Occult memetics often take a mundane form, rather than an overtly occult one
- This is due to natural selection within the competition of ideas

**Competition and Evolution in Memetics**:
- Some "life forms" (ideas/memes) die quickly, others replicate well and spawn mutants
- Overly occult memes are limited in their spread as they only appeal to a specific audience
- Disguised or unintentional occult memes outcompete the overtly occult ones
- Propaganda and political concepts can be disguised in seemingly innocent materials

**Memetic Wars**:
- Memetics can involve a "war" between competing ideas/memes
- A successful meme may be countered by an "anti-virus" meme with the goal of destroying it
- The goal is to replicate the "antivirus" meme more effectively, not to convince the creator of the original meme

**Persuasion and Influence**:
- The purpose of debates is primarily to influence undecided onlookers, not the opponent
- Arguments are structured to win over the majority of passive viewers, not to convert the opponent


### EFFECTS OF MEMETICS: 4 CHAN

**Effects of Memetics: Ebolachan and Nergal**

**4chan and Memetic Spread**:
- Ebola outbreak led to collective cultural meltdown on 4chan's politically incorrect board
- Creation of "ebolachan" anime character as egregore, spreading through memes
- Desire to offend and frighten central to the meme's spread

**Egregores**:
- Thought forms collectively willed into existence, potentially semi-sentient
- Ebolachan example showcased how collective will can strengthen and spread egregore
- Negative reactions fueled the spread of the egregore

**Occult Implications**:
- Ebolachan created to shock, frighten, and power up other ritualism
- Rituals aimed at creating chaos but ultimately leading to order
- Second round of memetic force with Kek and Geb, Pepe and Shadilay

**Synchronicity and the Occult**:
- Convergence of events and concepts that appear to defy rational explanation
- Occultist can cause memetic events through will and action
- Current synchronicity spreading occult awareness organically

**Kek and Geb, Pepe and Shadilay**:
- Second round of memetic force with political implications
- Memes representing deities Kek (Egyptian god) and Nergal (Mesopotamian god)
- Spreading through popular culture, influencing political discourse

**Caution**:
- Belief in the occult can displace the mind and lead to a breakdown
- Importance of self-control, tactics, strategy, and wit in handling the occult's effects.


### MEMETIC TACTICS OF NOTE

**Memetics Tactics:**
* **Irreducible complexity**: Keep it simple
	+ Use of memes:
		- Irreducible complexity in form and content
		- Simplistic images or text
		- Evoke emotions without lengthy explanations
	+ Wojak ("Feels Bad") example: separate entity representing regret, sadness, and discomfort
* **Translatability**: Ideas must be easily understood across languages and cultures
	+ Use of English for wider reach
	+ Lower reading level preferred
* **Hierarchy of human understanding**:
	+ Visual > Textual > Auditory
	+ Difficulty in encapsulating meaning in images alone
* **Spiritual memes**:
	+ Veil spiritual overtones with alchemy or symbolism
	+ Replicate image first, then describe significance later
* **Competition**: Tinker with and experiment for consistent positive effects
	+ Ineffective memes may require significant effort to replicate.


### REALITY IS SUBJECTIVE IN HUMAN SYSTEMS

**Subjectivity in Human Understanding of Reality**

**Color Perception**:
- Sky appears blue to humans within human framework
- Objectively true statement about color emitted
- Subjectively true statement based on human understanding
- Reality is subjective, not objective

**Constructed Terms and Human Framework**:
- "Racism" did not exist until modernity
- Loaded terms used to fill gaps in human understanding
- Absolute truth exists only within our framework

**Reality vs. Perception**:
- Observations are influenced by emotion and wishful thinking
- Reality is not discrete, but subjective and open to interpretation
- Memetics can be impacted by this inherent subjectivity

**Manipulating Reality**:
- Convincing others of one's perception becomes reality
- Madman vs. visionary - difference lies in persuasion skills

**Importance of Understanding Subjectivity**:
- Reality is not objective, but shaped by human understanding
- Recognizing subjectivity can help navigate complex issues


### HOW I DESTROYED ICQ CHAT I

**Propaganda and ICQ Chatting Service:**
* Description of a noble but unimportant goal: to enjoy himself on IRC chatting service, faced resistance from site administrators
* Developed cunning long-term campaign for victory
* Described self as proponent of Luciferian liberty, fighting back against those who stifled speech
* Used stockholm syndrome tactic: attacking everyone, then convincing them to join his movement
* Phase one: attacked everyone and gained acceptance that site administrators were biased and inept
* Phase two: spoke softly to this segment of the population, convinced them they were part of a liberation movement
* Unleashed Hell on the website, called for backup, emptied it of users within months
* Negative effect: site was eventually destroyed by owners due to constant attacks
* Won in the end as population became polarized and enemies turned into doppelgangers.

**Understanding the Propaganda Technique:**
* Polarize the population: create distinct groups with strong opinions towards a specific issue or target
* Turn enemies into doppelgangers: make adversaries adopt similar communication styles or beliefs.
