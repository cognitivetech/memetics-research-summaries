## Meme creation and sharing processes. 1. INTRODUCTION

**Meme Creation and Sharing Processes: Individuals Shaping the Masses**

**Introduction:**
- Individuals can effect massive online social change through meme sharing
- Meme creation and sharing influenced by creators and consumers
- Present work explores meme creation as a separate process from sharing
- Psychological methods, web log monitoring, statistical modeling, agent modeling used
- Observed human participants creating and sharing memes over 70 days
- Statistical modeling and agent simulation to investigate contagion dynamics.

**Meme Creation:**
- Individuals create memes that can influence the masses
- Creators determine initial meme sharing

**Meme Sharing:**
- Sharing decisions accumulate to determine total meme sharing
- Psychological methods, web log monitoring, statistical modeling, and agent modeling used
- Observed human participants creating and sharing memes over 70 days

**Results:**
- Statistical modeling and agent simulation conducted
- Contagion dynamics investigated.


## 2. CONTENT CREATION AND SHARING (STUDY 1)

**Study 1: Content Creation and Sharing (Image Macros)**

**Phase 1: Observing Meme Creation Process**
- Participants invited to lab to observe meme creation process
- Online meme creating and sharing website, "memelab," built for investigation
- Memelab mimics popular meme sharing websites with a memorable 5-letter Dot-com URL
- Individual workstations in lab prepared with loaded memelab website

**Meme Rating Task**
- Participants complete surveys to capture demographic information and Internet usage profiles
- Complete psychological measures for modeling purposes
- Rate 8 memes on likelihood of sharing online, manipulating relevance between academic and animal themes

**Creation Process**
- Observe participants creating image macros using memelab website
- Participants pick background picture, add captions, create unique URLs for each meme
- Sharing screen displays linking information and guide to embedding URLs in social media messages
- Memes assigned permanent, unique URLs

**Sharing Process**
- Monitor sharing process through web server access logs as a proxy for sharing behavior
- Most memes viewed fewer than twice; top-viewed meme requested 72 times

**Phase 2: Analyzing Results**
- Monitor trafÔ¨Åc over 70-day period, log approximately 2000 total requests for the study's 236 memes

**Models Derived from Data**
- Creator model of re-sharing behavior: Predicts total hits received by a meme based on meme ratings and psychological scales (explains 11.5% variance in consumer sharing behavior)
- Consumer model of individual sharing decisions: Predicts the decision to share a meme based on features of the meme, including humor ratings, self-relevance ratings, and self-reference words in captions (explains 37.5% variance in sharing decisions)


## 3. A CONTAGION MODEL OF MEME SHARING (STUDY 2)

**Study 2: Contagion Model of Meme Sharing (Replication)**

**Methods:**
- **Simulation Environment**: Implemented using Repast Symphony IDE
- **Agents**: 15,000 agents, similar to campus population size
- **Meme Propagation**: Decisions based on sharing model
- **Encountering Agents**: Random walk through a 2-dimensional space
- **Experimenter (Zombie Character)**: Recruits agents for study
- **Meme Content**: Vector of random values from Gaussian distribution
- **Sharing Model**: Determines if an agent shares memes with nearby agents
- **Propagation**: Infected agents share memes to others, causing meme spread

**Results:**
- **Total Infections over Time**: Analogous to total re-sharing among human participants
- **Qualitative Comparison**: Similarities between web traffic data and simulation time series (see figure 1, right panel)
- **Future Research**: Needed for experimental validation of simulation results in human samples.
