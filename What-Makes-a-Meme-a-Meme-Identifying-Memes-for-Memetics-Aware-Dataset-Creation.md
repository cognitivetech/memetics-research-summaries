**Meme Identification and Classification**

**Introduction:**
- Internet Memes: expression, interaction, culture (Shifman 2014b)
- Goals of meme classification: identifying affects (sentiment, hate, humor, sarcasm, offensiveness), preventing hateful rhetoric, detecting cyberbullying, recognizing trolling behavior, discerning sentiment
- Manual process for collecting and labeling sample memes
- Need to identify memes from non-memetic content

**Meme Identification vs. Classification:**
- Meme identification: selecting memes from non-memetic content (non-memes)
- Meme classification: classifying various affects conveyed by memes

**Limitations of Current Approach:**
- Lack of standards or criteria used to identify memes from non-memetic content in datasets
- Importance of recognizing memetics in meme identification and interpretation (Courtois and Frissen 2022; Segev et al. 2015)

**Meme Typology:**
- Memes form groups through shared memetic elements
- Memetic elements: components or traits common between memes, indicative of derivation from previous memes
- Understanding meaning conveyed by memetic elements is subtle and requires familiarity with their usage in preceding memes (Wiggins and Bowers 2015)

**Memetic Elements vs. Non-memetic Content:**
- Memes rely on memetic elements for interpretation; non-memetic content conveys meaning without them
- Combining both types of content in datasets hinders meme classifier development

**Challenges in Meme Classification:**
- Understanding the meaning conveyed by memetic elements is subtle and requires familiarity with their usage (Wiggins and Bowers 2015)
- Memetic elements evolve and change over time, making classification difficult
- Meme culture is constantly evolving, requiring classifiers to keep up with new memes and memetic elements.

**Contributions of This Work:**
* Provide a theoretically grounded definition of memes
* Develop repeatable methodology for meme identification based on memetics concept
* Propose using this definition and protocol to create meme datasets for affective classification by supervised machine learning models

**Survey Findings:**
* Existing meme classification datasets lack replicable meme identification or filtration of non-memetic content methods
* The presented study aims to address this issue through a clear definition and protocol

**Main Components:**
1. **Definition of Meme:** Not specified in the provided text, but assumes a theoretically grounded one is needed.
2. **Repeatable Meme Identification Protocol:** Based on the concept of memetics; details not given.
3. **Use for Memetic Datasets Creation:** For affective classification using supervised machine learning models.
4. **Importance:** Clear definition and methodology necessary to create reliable meme datasets.
5. **Critique of Existing Datasets:** Lack replicable meme identification or filtration methods.
6. **Presented Protocol:** Identifies multimodal user-generated content as meme or non-meme based on its memetic nature.
7. **Application:** Demonstrates the application of the protocol to samples from surveyed datasets, showing both memes and non-memetic content in them.
