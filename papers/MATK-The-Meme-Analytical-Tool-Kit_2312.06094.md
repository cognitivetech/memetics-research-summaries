**Introduction**
- Memes have become a significant means of communication and cultural expression
- Influence digital interactions and content consumption
- Spread rapidly across internet, convey complex ideas, humor, social commentary
- Attracted attention from industry and academia for analysis

**Datasets and Models**
- Facebook launched "The Hateful Meme Challenge" with 10,000 memes annotated for hateful and non-hateful attributes
- Studies on offensive content detection, sentiment analysis, victim identification
- Multimodal models used: classic two-stream models, fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (Muennighoff, 2020; Pramanick et al., 2021b; Yang et al., 2022; Sandulescu, 2020; Cao et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2022)
- Challenge in reproducing models: dispersed across separate GitHub repositories
- Need for a centralized repository to facilitate organization and sharing of models and datasets

**Meme Analysis Toolkit (MATK)**
- Addresses issue by providing an open-source toolkit specifically designed for meme classification tasks
- Supports existing datasets and cutting-edge multimodal models
- Assists researchers and engineers in training, reproducing multimodal models
- Provides analysis techniques to gain insights into strengths and weaknesses of models
- Encourages contribution of new techniques and datasets, promoting reproducibility and collaboration
- Consists of: overall framework (Figure 1)

**Contributions**
- Facilitates the training process for state-of-the-art meme classification models
- Simplifies adoption of post-hoc model interpretation techniques such as LIME and SHAP
- Encourages contribution of new datasets and techniques, promoting collaboration.
