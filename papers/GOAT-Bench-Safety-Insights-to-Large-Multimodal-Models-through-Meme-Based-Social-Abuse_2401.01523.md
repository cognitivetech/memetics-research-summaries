**Memes and Social Media: An Emerging Challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)**

**Introduction:**
- Exponential growth of social media leads to increase in online abuse of memes
- Memes have subtle, implicit meanings that are challenging to evaluate
- LMMs like GPT-4V emerge as potential solutions due to their multimodal capabilities

**GOAT-Bench Dataset:**
- Introduced for evaluating LMMs on handling meme-based social abuse
- Comprises over 6K varied memes with themes such as hate speech, sexism, cyberbullying

**Objective:**
- Assess the ability of LMMs to accurately identify and respond to nuanced aspects of social abuse in memes
- Determine if current models exhibit a deficiency in safety awareness and sensitivity to implicit abuse

**Methods:**
- Evaluate LMMs on tasks like hatefulness, misogyny, offensiveness, sarcasm, harmfulness
- Control for granularity of each specific meme task for detailed analysis
- Extend evaluation to thought chains, few-shot demonstrations, supervised fine-tuning

**Significance:**
- Critical impediment to realizing safe artificial intelligence if LMMs are insensitive to implicit abuse in memes.
- GOAT-Bench and accompanying resources contribute to ongoing research on this vital field.

**GOAT-Bench: Evaluating Model Capability to Detect Meme-Based Social Abuse**

**Leveraging GOAT-Bench**:
- Assesses capability of various LMMs (language models) in detecting meme-based social abuse through complex reasoning
- Conceived as a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, with subsets for evaluating specific model abilities and analyzing strengths/weaknesses

**Observations on Performance**:
- In tasks focused on sexism (e.g., misogyny), significant disparities among LMMs
- Broader tasks (e.g., harmfulness) require advanced background knowledge and reasoning, resulting in modest performance of LMMs

**GOAT-Bench's Purpose**:
- Enable researchers to gain a multi-dimensional understanding of their models' abilities in addressing meme-based social abuse
- Contribute to the advancement of safety insights in LMMs as a critical step in preventing online social abuse and ensuring community cohesion

**GOAT-Bench Dataset**:
- Tackles the five interwoven meme tasks (Figure 2)
