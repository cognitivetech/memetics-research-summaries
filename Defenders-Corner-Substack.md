### [A Beginner's Guide to Culture Science](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/a-beginners-guide-to-culture-science)

**Culture Science and Memetics**

**Core Idea of Culture Science/Memetics:**
- Narratives & beliefs have observable effects on behavior at individual and societal levels
- Can study patterns of these narratives, their interactions, propagation rates, and mutations

**Difference Between Biology and Memetics:**
- Biology studies matter patterns that survive
- Memetics studies behavior patterns that survive

**Politeness as Sociocultural Technology:**
- Operating protocol for social interactions
- Documented and taught like HTTP

**Origin of Cultural Norms or Beliefs:**
- Some evolved organically (e.g., "don't talk to strangers")
- Others are pro-social propaganda (e.g., "designated driver")

**Studying Beliefs**:
- Difficult to get rid of a belief even if you want to
- Beliefs choose us more than we choose them
- Some beliefs are good for us, some not

**Religion as Oldest Science (Memetics)**:
- Prophets noticed humans stuck in lose-lose games
- Told self-fulfilling stories for human cooperation and thriving
- Prophecy a decentralized job ad for potential leaders to match
- Stories grow and change beyond the original prophet's control

**Open Source Nature of Culture Science:**
- Original prophet does not control the story
- Story can grow and change beyond them
- Anyone can contribute to documenting, studying, and changing it.

**Contributing to Culture through Narratives**

**Realization of Influence**:
- First realized could contribute through "Anatomy of an Internet Argument" series
- Disagreements result from narrative conflicts
- Reframing truth within existing narratives is a simple contribution
- Creating new narratives to explain existing truths is a bigger contribution

**Scientific Significance**:
- Memetics' predictive power demonstrates its potential as a scientific field
- Effects of narratives on individuals and communities are scientific questions

**Network Contribution**:
- Accepting resonating ideas/beliefs as "nodes in the network" is an ongoing contribution to culture

**Proposed Narrative Reframing**:
- Aim to shift narrative: "next 4 years will be awful because of Trump"
- Proposal: "good things can happen despite Trump's presence"
- Changes relationship with truth without eroding group cohesion or morality

**Goals and Sharing Knowledge**:
- Understand personal narratives for self-awareness and behavior change
- Share understanding to help others change minds more easily
- Collaboratively create maps of community/society level narratives to coordinate around best visions

**Dangers of Cultural Engineering**:
- Inspecting, monitoring, and engineering cultural change is dangerous due to potential negative consequences
- Urgent need to involve as many people as possible in the process

**Collaboration with Like-Minded Individuals**:
- Share work, establish connections, and accelerate progress
- Contributions include memetics research articles or statements about work/support needed.

### [Blue tribe is starting to win by adopting the best of conservative values](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/blue-tribe-is-starting-to-win-by)

**Discovering Insights About Conservatism:**

**The Importance of Open-Mindedness:**
- At 30 years old, learned to think for oneself (insight #1)
- Realized "conservative" is not inherently good or bad (insight #2)

**Understanding the Attachment to Tools:**
- People are attached to tools for identity purposes
- Fear of using alternative tools may hinder problem solving
- Adopting new tools can make the world a better place, even if it means working with those considered "the enemy"

**A Changing Landscape:**
- Conservative strategies are being adopted by previously perceived opponents
- Marie Gluesenkamp Perez's success story: pro deregulation campaign
- Joey Politano's criticism of left-wing for being against deregulation

**The Power of Useful Tools:**
- Winning strategy spreads when effective tools are adopted
- Blue tribe starting to see conservatism as a useful tool, not a bad thing
- Prediction: red and blue tribes will adopt each other's successful strategies

**Benefits of Adopting Conservative Values:**
- Solving real problems and gaining public trust
- Winning elections
- Spreading good parts of conservative values among all tribes.

### [Can we use Twitter Radar to empirically study & predict culture?](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/can-we-use-twitter-radar-to-empirically)

**Twitter Radar: Analyzing Cultural Discourse**

**Overview:**
- Semantic search tool for internet discourse analysis
- Graph ideas over time to understand their spread
- Limited compared to a grand vision of idea tracking

**Features:**
- Keyword search with graphs and tabs
  - Latest: same as regular twitter search
  - Top: same as regular twitter search
  - Trends: summarizes topics of discussion
- Data limited to last 7 days, no older data available

**Usage:**
- Search for specific terms or phrases
- Observe the spread and popularity of ideas over time
- Identify origins of mainstream ideas

**Limitations:**
- Limited to keyword search, can't track general topics
- "Trends" tab not always useful, returns nothing for some queries

**Marketing:**
- Targeted at stock traders and financial hobbyists
  - Encourages early adoption and demonstrates value
- Twitter collects data themselves and offers insights to users.

**Perspective:**
- Potential societal benefits in having greater visibility over cultural discourse
- Early adopters with a financial incentive can help pave the way for wider acceptance and use of idea tracking tools.

### [How to build culture tech](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/how-to-build-culture-tech)

**Solutions for Improving Poll Results on Twitter**

**Problem:** Random voting due to users wanting to see results before making a decision

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Implement a "Show me the results" button**: Blocks user from voting after clicking it, ensuring more accurate poll results
2. Creating a web app: Users can make a poll and tweet a link to it instead of using Twitter's built-in feature.
3. **Culture Tech:** Encourage users to adopt a cultural solution where they share their honest opinions on polls through comments or other platforms, leading to more accurate results for everyone
4. Open Source Software Development: Twitch and Twitter could have opened sourced their platform, allowing users to contribute improvements (PRs) and enhance the product for all users
5. **Use of emojis, upvotes, downvotes in polls:** Encourage more honest feedback through various means, such as emojis or traditional voting methods.

**Benefits of Cultural Solutions:**
- Easy to adopt without writing code
- Immediate benefit for individual users
- Improves product experience for all users (collective benefit)

**Twitch and Twitter's Success Stories:**
90% of successful product development at Twitch came from community contributions, demonstrating the potential of cultural solutions in software development.

**Open API for Twitter Data:** Users can export their data and share it with the public to build upon existing cultural infrastructure.

**Building Cultural Infrastructure:** Encourage users to share honest opinions about companies through an extension or other platforms, leading to more accurate information for everyone.

### [Destigmatize being dumb](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/destigmatize-being-dumb)

**Benefits of Embracing "Dumbness"**
- Improves personal intelligence: acknowledging weaknesses leads to learning new skills (e.g., abstract thinking)
- Enhances problem-solving abilities: asking for help and examples contributes valuable insights
- Encourages societal improvement: reduces stigma and allows for open dialogue about intelligence

**Strategies for Embracing "Dumbness"**
1. Admire intelligence without stigmatizing dumbness: reward the process of finding flaws, not just being smart
2. Find comfort in calibration: recognize that everyone has strengths and weaknesses
3. Start small changes: influence your micro-culture and spread the idea to those around you
4. Share resources and ideas: collaborate with others who understand this concept
5. Consider creating merchandise or a campaign to promote the message (e.g., t-shirts, website)
6. Engage in open dialogue about intelligence and its role in society.

**Challenges in Embracing "Dumbness"**
- Separating good person vs smart person perception
- Addressing potential misconceptions or celebrating being dumb for the sake of it (keep focus on process)
7. Bootstrapping cultural shifts: start small, spread ideas, and trust that calibration helps everyone.

### [Narrative Spears ](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/narrative-spears)

**Narrative Spear as a Social Technology**
- A tool to effect change in a human community (theoretical construct)
- Not a prophecy, but a self-fulfilling prediction
  * Problem in society described, addressed, and enacted
  * Outcome: problem solved or passed on to someone else
- Win-win situation for individuals and the community

**Studying Narrative Spears**
- Empirical study of narrative spear dynamics
- Test predictions against reality
  * Refine theory if it fails
- Abandoning a theory is subjective, not scientific

**Characteristics of Successful Narrative Spears**
- Flexible: adaptable to various situations
- Self-reliant: doesn't depend on specific people
- Rewarding: benefits those who execute it
  * Money or status earned
  * Clout for helping predict success
- Realistic: high likelihood of occurring
- Beautiful: easily understood and desirable

**Advantages of Launching Narrative Spears**
- Personal benefit: increased chances for power, status, and career growth
- Win-win situation: benefits both individual and the community
- Valuable work: compensated fairly to improve skills and create more effective spears.

### ["We've been wrong about math for 2300 years & I'm here to fix it"](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/weve-been-wrong-about-math-for-2300)

**Resistance to Believing Problems Can Be Solved**
- The feeling that some problems seem "ancient & unfixable" is common
- This feeling can be rooted in past failures to solve a problem despite attempts over long periods of time
- We tend to focus on the lack of solutions rather than potential for new approaches

**Examples of Solved Problems**
- Society has solved seemingly insurmountable problems before
- Changes often occur when scientific, cultural, or political conditions shift
- Examples: Israel/Palestine conflict, Buddhist meditation techniques

**Approach to Finding Solutions Now**
- Skepticism towards claims of quick solutions is healthy but can lead to overconfidence in immutability
- Consensus among working mathematicians on the definition and nature of math exists
- Documenting, charting, and consolidating this consensus could lead to progress
- No one has all the answers; we must be proactive in seeking solutions rather than passively observing problems persist.

**The Loud Music Problem at Parties**

**Problem Statement**:
- The music at parties is too loud for some people
- No one seems to be addressing the issue
- It's like "the party is the planet, and the music is too loud"

**Attempting a Solution**:
- Turn off the music or ask if it's too loud
- **Andrés Gómez Emilsson's perspective**: Don't assume someone else will solve the problem - take action yourself

**Historical Context**:
- In the 1800s, anesthesia during surgery was unheard of and considered a "miracle"
- Today, we take it for granted as part of routine medical procedures

**Conclusion**:
- The loud music issue at parties can be compared to the lack of anesthesia in early medicine
- We should not expect someone else to solve the problem - individuals should take action themselves.

### [Feynman's Razor ](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/feynmans-razor)

**Feynman's Razor: Explaining Technical Matters to Laypeople**

**Feynman's Razor**: If someone who understands the concept can read your explanation and get it, then your explanation is adequate. Otherwise, it's not good enough.

**Critique of Nonsensical Error Message**:
- A user complained about a confusing error message: "This message can't be saved because it no longer exists. It can only be discarded."
- The user found the message contradictory and didn't understand why they couldn't save it if it no longer existed.
- Some people suggested explaining it in simpler terms, such as "error code 1027: file cannot be saved."

**Importance of Being Faithful**:
- Providing accurate and faithful information is better than giving users a false or confusing model of how the system works.
- Even if the user doesn't care about the details, they can still benefit from understanding the general idea.

**Applying Feynman's Razor**:
- For a "message no longer exists" error: "Error code 1027: file cannot be saved."
- Provide users with clear options and let them decide if they want to copy or delete the file.
