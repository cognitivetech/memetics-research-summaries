**Multimodal Explanation of Code-Mixed Cyberbullying Memes (MExCCM)**

**Background:**
- Human moderation of multimodal content on social media untenable due to the increase in memes and online abuse
- Memes: images with text descriptions, popular for humor but also propagate cyberbullying
- Cyberbullying: communication that disparages an individual based on characteristics, 40% of social media users have experienced it
- Consequences: despair, worry, low self-esteem, suicidal thoughts
- Automatic cyberbullying detection with explainability required to minimize unpleasant consequences

**Previous Research:**
- Studies focused primarily on textual content for cyberbullying detection
  - Recently, memes receiving attention in monolingual setting
- Limited research on code-mixed language and its explanations
  - Rapid proliferation of code-mixed languages in multilingual countries
- Researchers concentrated on improving performance without insight into explainability

**Motivation:**
- Cyberbullying detection: text (highlighting words or phrases) and images (internal layers' attention weight visualization) have been researched separately
  - No work combining both modalities to justify offensiveness of cyberbullying content
- Semiotic textology linguistic theory suggests considering how each media derives meaning: dictum, evocatum, apperceptum

**Contributions:**
1. Presenting MExCCM: a novel task for generating multimodal explanations for code-mixed cyberbullying memes
2. Introducing MultiBully-Ex: the first multimodal explainable code-mixed cyberbullying dataset, including manual highlighting of both text and image modalities in a meme to demonstrate why it is considered bullying
3. Proposing an end-to-end Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) approach for visual and textual meme explanation to encourage research on code-mixed data.
