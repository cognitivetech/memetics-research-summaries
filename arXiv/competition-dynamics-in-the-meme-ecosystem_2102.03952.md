## Competition Dynamics in the Meme Ecosystem

**Understanding Meme Dynamics on Reddit**

**Background:**
- Goal: Study collective dynamics of memes in accelerating, competitive environment
- Ecological perspective taken by analyzing 352 popular memes from the past decade

**Findings:**
1. **Frequency of Memes**: Has scaled almost exactly with total content created on Reddit over the last decade.
2. **Limited Human Attention**: With increasing data and memes, diversity has decreased slightly at community level.
3. **Average Lifespan of Meme**: Dramatically decreased due to increased competition and decreasing collective attention span.


## Introduction

**Social Media and Attention Economy:**
* With the rise of social media platforms, information production and consumption have become more accessible and affordable
* Reduced cost has led to an increase in content volume, shifting from content scarcity to consumer scarcity
* Attention economy focuses on explaining allocation of cognitive resources in creation and consumption of information
* Primary research areas include content recommendation systems and understanding consumer behavior

**Meme Culture:**
* Memes: short phrases or images that spread rapidly online
* Memes have unique properties and are a subset of the information landscape whose dynamics are not well understood
* Associated with genes and gene evolution, but also epidemiology and ecology
* Ecological perspective offers a unique interpretation of meme dynamics

**Ecological Perspective:**
* Memes as individual species competing for limited resources (human attention) within the same environment or habitat
* Competition drives survival and continued existence within minds and communication patterns
* Differences between ecological, economic, epidemiological, and genealogical perspectives

**Research Questions:**
RQ1: How does collective user attention scale?
RQ2: How do memes compete for attention?
RQ3: How have the dynamics of collective attention changed over time?

**Meme Dataset:**
* 352 text memes in the dataset, ranging from 1 to 8 tokens long
* Memes reference current pop culture events and unconnected trends
* Analysis focuses on understanding meme behavior using ecological principles.


## Data Collection

**Data Collection**
- Used a dataset of 352 most popular memes from KnowYourMeme.com
- Identified individual occurrences on Reddit
- Memes selected from Confirmed category, with text-based memes ranging from 250k to 13 million page views
- Image-memes not included in analysis due to rapid evolution
- Meme texts truncated to include only 8 token prefix
- Final set contains meme-phrases ranging from 1 to 8 word tokens
- Collected all posts and comments from Jan. 2010 to Jan. 2020
- Number of monthly posts and comments plotted in Figure 2

**Ethical Considerations**:
- Research considered human subjects research
- Seeked and received research approval from Institution Review Board.


## Collective Attention to Memes is Stationary

**Scaling Collective Attention to Memes**

**Background:**
- Innovation and technological development have led to accelerating social innovations on online platforms like Reddit.
- Moore's Law, genome sequencing, telecommunications bandwidth are examples of compounding increase in densities leading to remarkable increases.
- In online social systems, similar patterns exist: social innovations are accelerating [18, 24, 14, 25].

**Research Question (RQ1):**
- How does collective user attention of memes scale?
- Does the presence of larger groups result in super-scaling effects like population densities and software development?

**Measuring Collective Attention:**
- Estimate collective attention by the number of times a meme appears, i.e., its frequency (Fm(t)).
- Normalize the frequency of meme occurrences to control for the growth of Reddit: Fm(t) = Fm(t)/B(t).

**Findings:**
- Meme occurrence has remained consistent over the past decade when controlled for Reddit's overall activity (Pearson R= +0.03 , p-value<0.01).
- Competition acts as a global bandwidth cap in social media platforms, sustaining a relatively limited population of memes despite user growth and content volume increase.

**Implications:**
- Understanding the impact of competition on individual actors [12] and determining successful meme features [1, 2] are valuable extensions of classic attention economy.
- Demonstrates that competition can act as a global bandwidth cap in social media platforms.


## Competition Among Memes

**Competition Among Memes**

**The Prevalence of Individual Memes**:
- The prevalence of individual memes rises and falls over time
- Popularity is fleeting, but as a meme dies out, another always seems to rise to take its place
- The ebb and flow of what is or is no longer popular has long been studied as the **diffusion of innovations**

**The Ecological Analogy**:
- The competition among memes is not unlike competition in markets, where innovations eventually replace outdated products, or ecological systems, where competition among individuals in a group exerts a selective pressure that rewards certain genetic innovations

**Measuring Memes Competition for Attention**:
- Research question RQ2: How do memes compete for attention?
- Specifically, as Reddit grows and new memes are introduced, does the overall diversity increase or decrease?

**Simpson's Diversity Index**:
- Simpson's Diversity Index (D) is a measure of diversity in an ecological system
- It takes into account both the number of species present and the population of each species
- For Reddit, subreddits are considered communities, memes are species, and meme occurrences are species entities

**Findings on Memes Diversity**:
- The diversity of Reddit communities is decreasing at a small but steady rate (0.48% per year)
- This indicates that subreddit communities are using slightly less diverse meme subsets
- This suggests a slow **Balkanization of Reddit communities**, with human attention and memes moving towards more niche subreddits


## Changing Dynamics of the Meme Ecosystem

**Meme Ecosystem Dynamics**

**Competition of Memes**:
- Consequences of meme competition in a social media ecosystem
- Rapid spread and short duration of viral concepts
- Focus on collective attention dynamics

**Dynamics of Collective Attention**:
- Recent work suggests acceleration of new concepts becoming viral
- Analysis on Reddit memes: RQ3 - How have the dynamics changed over time?

**Peak Dynamics**:
- Average relative meme frequency over years
- No change in peak frequency or relative loss/gain distributions
- Indicates no significant acceleration of memes

**Meme Lifespans**:
- Definition and computation of meme lifespan
- Results: Shorter lifespans over time (Figure 7)
- Increase in the number of active memes (Figure 7A)
- Decrease in normalized active memes (Figure 7B)

**Exception**: Long-lasting memes that transcend their origins and maintain a consistent presence despite collective attention decreasing.

**Memes in a Content-Consumption System**:
- Memes compete for scarce user attention
- Collective attention favors the newest, freshest content
- No meme is immortal.


## Conclusions

**Conclusions:**
* Coalescence of research questions into an emerging theory of meme dynamics on Reddit
* Ecological perspective: consistent fraction of Reddit devoted to text memes, decreasing diversity, increasing meme competition and turnover
* Meme lifespans have decreased significantly but not all aspects are accelerating, growth outpaced by expansion of Reddit
* Limitations: focus on textual artifacts, visual memes not fully addressed, strict text-matching algorithm used for identification.
